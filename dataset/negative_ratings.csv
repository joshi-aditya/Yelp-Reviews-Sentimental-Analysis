"Excellent pizza is completely irrelevant when the server lies to your table's face. One star reviews are automatic from me when a server blames the kitchen, or lies. In this case, it was both. We walked in when the host stand said 45 minutes for a pizza- we waited 80, and were given no apologies or anything from our server. We asked repeatedly when our pizza might be up, and were met with just shrugs and no empathy or apologies. She just told us that the wait time was over an hour for our pizzas. I didn't bother debating because there's really no point. Around the 60 minute mark, she began avoiding our table entirely. We asked for our checks before our pizza even came, because we had to be somewhere after dinner. At least she accommodated that."
"What a disappointment it's all crust. This is supposed to have extra cheese on it where is the extra cheese? Actually where are the ingredients? You really have gone downhill, serving this is an embarrassment."
"I cannot tell you how disappointing my experience at Pequod's was.  Based on all the reviews as well as how many times it's on food shows, I had high expectations.  My husband had been before and kept telling me it wasn't that great, but of course, I needed to try for myself.  The first time, he got deep dish and I was sure that was the reason for his negativity.  We don't like deep dish.So we got thin crust of sausage and garlic.  30 minutes later the pizza comes out and it's covered in cheese and sauce.  The cheese was a little too overpowering and the sauce was very tomato based.  But what I didn't like that much was the skimpiness of sausage (the last 5 pizza slices didn't have any on it), and the crust just wasn't that great.  While the crust was extremely thin on the bottom, it was very doughy on the side.  I also thought the crust would have that caramelized / burntness that the deep dish does.  It didn't.   So we left most of the crust and the last 4-5 slices.  We didn't even feel it was worth the effort to box it up.  That disappointing!On the plus side - we had the Pequod's Salad (romaine, pepperoni, peppers, cucumbers, mozzarella cheese, etc) and Italian Dressing.  This was excellent.  The lg salad was great to split between us and the dressing was so much better than your usual Italian as it was full of spices.Our server was also very good.  Attentive on the drinks and everything.We later found out as we were leaving that they have an extra thin crust where there is less side crust.  I don't remember it on the menu, but even still, we will not be back to try it."
"I honestly expected so much more from a place that is this hyped up. Would definitely prefer any other deep dish place (Gino's East, Lou's and Giordano's) over Pequod's.Where to even begin? First off, the service is terrible. We called at 4:00PM on a Sunday for pickup was told it would take 50 minutes to prepare the food. We arrived at 5:20 due to bad traffic. I went inside and paid and was told my name would be called when the food was ready. I expected the food to come out right away since it had been 80 minutes since I called but nope, it took 10 minutes to just get part of our order (the soup and salad). Then we waited another 10 minutes to get the two large pizzas that we ordered, but we were still missing our cheesy garlic bread. The lady bringing us our food seem to have no idea about what we ordered. After waiting another 5 minutes for our garlic bread, they forgot the marinara sauce (which costs extra $0.65 btw). So basically we had to wait almost two hours after we ordered to receive our entire order.Now the food. We ordered two large pizzas, one with pep, bacon, peppers and mushrooms, and one with sausage, pineapple and spinach. They completely neglected to put pineapple on one pizza and put pepperoni instead. Also, each topping is $3, making each pizza around $30-$32. The pizza was basically an inch thick bread with toppings and lacked sauce. They also put an obnoxious amount of pepperoni on the pizza, some areas were 4 slices thick, making the pizza taste extremely heavy and salty. The crust was also black, burnt, and hard to chew.The pequods salad ($10) is probably one of the worst salads I've ever had. The menu didn't list any of the ingredients in the salad so I didn't know what to expect. The salad contained old wilted lettuce, and had pepperoni and sliced cheese on top, making it basically a pizza except with crappy lettuce as the base instead of bread. The tomatoes were borderline rotten, they were bitter and brown inside. I also ordered a vinaigrette dressing, but received two sauce containers of olive oil and two sauce containers of balsamic vinegar; did they expect me to make my own dressing? Usually vinaigrette comes premixed with seasoning. The cheesy garlic bread was basically baguette sliced in half with a sliced of cheese on top. By the time we got home, the bread was cold and hard and had to be warmed up again. TLDR; pretty much every aspect of our experience was extremely disappointing. No idea why people tolerate their service and food"
"This place was a BIG disappointment. We arrived on a friday night and they estimated the wait to be 1hr 40 min.. okay if this place had that many reviews than it must be worth it. So we waited about 2 hours before we got seated. We ordered the appetizer sampler that came out fairly quick. It had jalapeno poppers, (i thought it was too salty) fried zuccinni (not bad), and fried mushroom (ehh) My friend got the iltalian beef with cheese and peppers, i thought it was good, thats why i gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. The beef was moist and juicy and the sandwich had a lot of good flavor.They estimated the wait for our food to be another hour.. we waited around 45 minutes for our food to finally come.My boyfriend an i got the medium pizza with sausage. I was so disappointment, the pizza didnt taste good at all to me. i didnt even finish half of a slice. I think ive had better pizza at Blaze pizza or even dominos. The crust had a weird taste and texture to it, like the crust was really crumbly and just wasnt good. This is the longest ive ever waited for at a resturant and i really wish i didnt."
"We had a horrible experience we ended up walking out.  my pizza was burnt we ordered two pizzas only got one and the one we did get was burnt the appetizers were subpar the waitress was clearly irritated because of the crowds of people.  The manager,  Joel didn't even offer an apology. Said our pizza would be replaced but we are the ones that had to ask 25 minutes later where pizzas were then we finally just got up and walked out!  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  In total we wasted 3 hours and ended up getting pizza at Lou Malinati's."
"The service at Pequod's is absolutely pathetic.  The pizza is amazing, and I've gone back half a dozen times despite the service because of the pizza, but our experience last night was the last straw.  There's too many good pizza places in Chicago to warrant sitting through this kind of chaos.My husband and I went on a Tuesday night at 6 pm and ordered 1 medium, thin crust pizza and a garlic bread.  The sign did say it was 40 minute cook time for pizza, which we were prepared for, and the restaurant wasn't overly busy at the time.  After waiting for an hour, we had NO garlic bread, NO pizza, meanwhile two other tables large tables (one with 3 deep dish, and one with one) were served before us.  We told the waitress we had a 7:10 movie across the street, and she said our pizza was 5 minutes away.  15 minutes later and we still had no food, while others were getting their appetizers and pizza.  We decided to walk out.  It was absolutely abysmal service.  Had it been the first time, we would have given it a pass, but this was at least the 5th or 6th time that Pequod's took insanely long to serve us.  Don't waste your time - there's better pizza places in Chicago."
"Just coming back from new york and getting the best pizza there, I had to try out the pizza in chicago. I was expecting about the same or better because pizzas from these two cities are suppose to rival one another. GARLIC BREADThe bread wasn't very crispy and was very oily. I didn't taste much garlic and overall there was nothing special about it in flavor or texture. I could've bought a frozen garlic bread and made it better. JALAPENO POPPERSThe poppers were very disappointing because there was no spice or heat to them at all. They were cheesy, but bland. I definitely will not be eating these again.PAN PIZZA- sausage, spinach, green pepper, tomato, fresh garlic, bacon, fresh basil, and italian beefFor a pan pizza, the pizza was thick and not even crispy. It was pretty soggy and soft. It would've been forgivable if the flavors were there, but sadly, not even. I did like the flavors of the meat and veggie ingredients, but the texture and flavor of the pizza itself just killed the whole meal. The pizza here definitely is not on par as the one in new york nor the ones I've tried in other cities. I won't be getting pizza here or anything else."
"After hearing a lot of great reviews and recommendations from friends, me and one other person decided that we'd look forward to having some traditional deep dish pizza from Pequods as the pinnacle of our trip to Chicago.Unfortunately, by the time Saturday rolled around, we both were ill and didn't want to risk leaving the hotel. Instead, we ordered a deep dish pizza for delivery. The Pequod's hostess gave us an estimated time of 2-hours for delivery after taking our order and jotting down our phone number. We expected the wait to be that long so we ordered the pizza at 5pm and just had a small snack until it arrived.At about 7:45, we were concerned that something may have happened and called Pequod's back. After listening in on some back-and-forth arguing in the background, they had informed us that they made the delivery and called us to come down to get the pizza. We had never received a call so we asked what number was used to call us. The number they read back to me was off by 1 digit. A simple mistake but handled very poorly.After telling them that they used the wrong number, they tried to tell me that I told them the wrong number. I think I know my own phone number. The more likely scenario would be that the hostess punched the number in wrong and it was a simple typo ( they had a 9 instead of an 8 ).I said, okay fine, so how long will it take to redeliver it? They said ANOTHER HOUR. Pequods is 15min a way from downtown. We begrudgingly inform them that instead of waiting another hour, we'll drive the 30min round trip to pick it up. So we began the journey, sick and hardly able to move, to Pequods on a Friday night, downtown at 8pm. The drive took longer than expected. Because there is no parking, I get dropped off at the front and immediately go to the pick up area inside. Upon receiving the pizza, I was told that it was ""taken care of"". At the time I wasn't sure if they were trying to apologize and pay for the pizza or if they just used my card that I had put down when I ordered it for delivery hours before. We certainly didn't get an apology.We get back to the hotel around 8:45. By this time, it had almost been 4 hours since we ordered the pizza and it had certainly been sitting out for about 3 hours.Needless to say, it was cold, hard and not enjoyable. The amount of effort that Pequods made to ensure satisfaction was dismal at best. If they would've apologized, remade the pizza, and would've been more clear on ""it's already taken care"", I think I would happily give this place another shot when I come back. Due to the poor handling, I gave this 1 star only because I later found out through my bank statement that they did, indeed, charge me for the pizza."
"Horrible service!!! Crawling slow... Come here only if you have hours to burn or nothing better to do than watch paint dry... As per website instructions I called and order my dine in order (at 12:13) which means ""we will put your pizza in 15 mins before your arrival""When I came in the hostess was confused when I informed her my order was ""dine-in"" like she never seen their website before. Thankfully, a server stepped in, helped her and confirmed my order was received and said she got the kitchen to put it in and that it will take 25mins from when we were seated. We were seated (1:04pm). When we were seated I told our server about our dine-in order he said he saw it and the order was in (I literally saw it on his tablet!!!)One eternity later... At 2:08pm the manager came to inform us that the kitchen has some how ""threw"" away our order and forgot it?!? Our server came to tell us that he ""did everything right"" and it was the kitchen's fault. Way to go for team work! The least you can do is accept responsibility for it instead of blaming your team mates. You could have followed up with them anytime at the 25, 35, 45, 55 min mark when you noticed we did not have any pizza on our tables but you didn't!!! You chose to check in with the kitchen after 1h and 4 mins later? And had the cheeks to say ""you did everything right"".I too accept responsibility for trusting that you know how to do your job like an adult and not following up with you sooner."
"Sweetened semi-solid tomato sauce charred in a pan that they call pizza.  YOU can dupe this @Home.  Peel off cheese in a tasteless and useless deep dish dough is the only FUN thing you will experience. It's a good thing I know the ingredients of a HAWAIIAN PIZZA as the female server didn't.  ""The personal pan is add your own ingredients.""  Lame deflection.  Then, she disappeared.GOUGING... the PREMIUM TOPPING of Italian Beef on a personal pan pizza is one layer, 2-slices of Italian Beef.  You just paid extra for tomato sauce and useless dough!  80% of this order went to trash.Decent crunchy ITALIAN BEEF.  My first grilled sweet pepper, then sliced.  Less beef than Others.Ask your own SERVICE is an embarrassment to Chicago dining.  ASK for water.  ASK for a table, host gives you a bar.  You ASK for a table again as it's empty, I still got a bar.  However, a Dude entered and got a table for 1.NO outlets near tables.  NO Wi-Fi either?  Don't forget it's a dive pretending to be IT."
"Pequod's is a divisive food. I'm from New York and grew up with a pizzaiolo grandfather with Calabrian roots. This pizza would make him spin in his grave.I work near Pequod's and have eaten it a half dozen times or so, a few times in person, a few times delivered. We order it at work pretty often, because a bunch of people in my office love it. I'm not one of them. Do I really have to acknowledge that this place is popular? It's very popular, and my opinion is the minority opinion. It's not like I don't know this.One time after moving from Brooklyn to Chicago, I went with my wife to Pequod's and ate in person. We ordered a medium mushroom pizza. I strongly suspect the mushrooms came from a can. I could only describe the mushrooms as having the texture of snot and the taste of dirt. I have never in my life been made to feel so crestfallen by my food.Look. This is not pizza. This is focaccia. Unfortunately, this isn't even good focaccia: it's mediocre focaccia masquerading as pizza. This is food that lies to your face. It's almost entirely bread, with a rumor of sauce and a whisper of cheese, and everything is mysteriously sweet. Are they actually adding sugar to the sauce? What is even happening here? To continue to insist that this is pizza when it so clearly is not pizza is a form of gaslighting.And the ""caramelized crust""? Please. That's not culinary ingenuity, it's a parlor trick. It's just burnt cheese. Big whoop."
"ALL BREAD. ALL HYPE. Born and raised Chicagoan: Logan Square/Avondale. I enjoy pizza and I'm not the type to state that real chicagoans don't eat deep dishes; I love deepdish. contrary to what most people think, most born and raised chicagoans love deepdish too. It's not something you eat on a Tuesday. A quick slice, quick bite, deepdish is none of that. It's a meal. A good meal. It's a midwestern special occasion...Chicago has the best Best pizza in the country. I recall going to the famous Pequod's years back(2 years) and visiting a friends place down clybourn I figured we'd order from them.  I wonder why I haven't gone in awhile? Today's order reminded me why...2 hour wait to get Focaccia bread with thin layer of sauce and pepperoni  placed in the most messy fashion... do your self a favor, and I swear I'm not the only Chicagoan to agree, go to Lou Malnati's... Please don't believe people that state chicagoans don't eat deepdish. We do, but this place ain't it.The wings were pretty good though."
"Honestly the pizza for this place was amazing. Unfortunately I'm giving it 2 stars because of the service we received. It says it's open until 2 am and we walked in around 130. They sat us down and told us that the pizza would be at least a 45 minute wait. Not that big of a deal, we all had a few drinks and were just ready to eat. We also ordered an appetizer that came out quickly. I personally ordered a slice of pizza and they said it would come out earlier than the full pizza my fiend ordered. This was not the case. We waited almost 60 minutes for the pizzas we ordered. We had to ask for it to go because my friend drank a little more than planned. They were rude and told us we had to get her out of the building. Even though we had paid 50 dollars for pizza, and still did not receive it. We asked for it to go and we finally go it. Unfortunately my slice did not come out at all. When we asked we were told another 5-10 minutes and our Uber was already there. The staff did not communicate properly, were rude to us and definitely served us later than they should have. My friends enjoyed the pizza they ordered the next morning but other than I would not recommend this place to dine in."
"We waited over an hour in line. Then, we ordered a med pizza once sat. We watched everyone around us, who was sat after us, eat their pizza. So, we asked the waitress if there was a problem. She let her manager handle it so she could continue taking other orders. My date was upset. Manager tried to console us by offering a free pizza but my date wasn't having any of it. Now, Im back in Los Angeles and still bummed I traveled all the way to Chicago with no pizza to tell about. :( We were sat next to the waiter server station. A member of the wait staff passed us by at least 60 times. :( :( :("
"I've been here several times and have been disappointed every time. Yesterday was the last time I'll get pizza from here. The pizza was so much bread--about an inch of bread--it was ridiculous. It was an over-cooked loaf of bread essentially, very disappointing pizza for the wait time. For the price of the pizza you're better off trying to make a pizza yourself."
"We were told a 90 minute wait and we discussed and were happy to wait.  After 2 hrs and 15 min, we were treated poorly, ignored and we left. No pizza is worth that with two small children. Art of Pizza is your answer, good pizza is the question. We left and had wonderful pizza with people not over promising and under delivering.  A huge amount of time we will never get back.  Angry and never going back."
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE ""PIZZA""I am a native Chicagoan and was raised on extraordinarily great pizzas, and over the last three years, I have sadly watched all the best Chicago pizzas, except for one, slide down into the pizza abyss, where lousy pizza goes to die. Pequod's is not the lone survivor, that place starts with a ""G."" Pequod's is just another hack ""pizza."" I'll explain in greater detail for those of you wondering how this could be. Last Friday, late, my wife and I had a craving for pizza. Since our old favorites, which I won't indict here now, have become terrible, I decided to order my first Pequod's ""pizza."" I was so excited after all the buzz I had heard over the years. I even told the order taker how excited I was to order from them for the first time. Well, after the bready thing arrived, and we inspected it, I realized I had been taken for a ride. The ""pizza"" was not pizza at all, but rather three quarters of an inch of extremely sugary bread, topped with an imperceptibly thin film of cheese. The toppings we ordered, garlic and spinach, were nonexistent. I did spot what looked like a tiny spinach leaf, but I cannot be sure it was indeed spinach. Neither my wife nor I were able to taste any garlic, and we are both lovers of garlic. Atop the barely noticeable cheese and nonexistent toppings was a fine layer of what tasted like sugar-laden canned spaghetti sauce. I cannot believe anyone would eat this stuff, it's awful. I paid 20 bucks for a half a loaf of lousy bread and a slice of cheese with some smeared on spaghetti sauce. If this alleged ""pizza"" was good at one time, that's in the past, and I can assure you, it is not worth trying. We also ordered salads and soup, which was fair at best, and certainly the highlight of the order. I will never order from Pequod's again, once was more than enough. I wish I could give a negative rating, or a zero, because that would be an accurate score, so I will do it here: minus 3 rating for Pequod's. Absolutely terrible. Perhaps they will read my review and hastily make the appropriate upgrades to their bready thing that they mistakenly call a ""pizza."""
"I don't often give 1 star reviews, but when I do, it's for terrible pizza. We ordered 2 pan pizzas, and both were bland.  There were 7 of us in our party, and all 7 said ""Meh.""  Go to Lou Malnodi's or Aurello's or Giordanos or literally anywhere else. The pizzas at Costco are better.The staff was very nice. The upstairs was 20 degrees hotter than the rest of the restaurant.  But the fact that their famous pizza was bland and...bad...just made me weep.Queequeg and Ishmael deserve better than this!"
"This place came highly recommended by the staff at the front counter of my hotel, so we gave the a try for pizza, delivery. Well, it took an hour and a half and the crust was burned all the way around. Very disappointed because it was obviously burned and they still opted to deliver it. Try someplace, anyplace, else. Never again. Save yourself the aggravation, get your pizza elsewhere."
You have no idea how much I wanted to love this place. I did my research on Chicago pizza and decided to try Pequods. I really don't get the hype around this place. There was a 2 hr wait to be seated but we got lucky and scored seats at the bar after like 20 min. Throughout my meal I kept feeling sorry for ppl who came before us and were still waiting to be seated. They were bout to realize they wasted 3 hrs of their life waiting on unmemorable pizza. Burnt cheese is so over hyped and for most parts it's like you are eating a thick crust with some cheese and sauce with no flavorMaybe deep dish isn't for me but then I remember  Patxi in San Francisco and hope one day Chicago will live up to its name and surprise me with a great deep dish. Until then I say if you want deep dish go to Patxi!
"Burnt crust, no thanks. Not for me. I will say that I'm in the minority of my friends who loves this stuff.  The whole ""Chicago style pizza"" scene is totally lost on me. It's more like pasta than pizza. If you like  to eat your pizza with a fork and be full after one slice then have at it.  People rant and rave about this place, just not for me."
"I have been to Pequod's many times for a ""dining in"" experience and have always had a great pizza.This time I decided to get a pizza to carry out because the place was already very crowded.Unfortunately, it was only a ""meh"" pizza.The carmelized edge was a treat, but the crust and sauce were bland.  The sausage was very sparse.For a place of this caliber, the pizza was extremely disappointing."
"I'm disappointed because of all the build up. My kids gave them one, two, and three stars--so the average is two. The deep dish crust was a bit dry, didn't have enough cheese, and edges were burnt. The thin crust pizza was okay. The zucchini was inedible. The onion rings were okay. I really don't understand why they got all these awards. The pizzas didn't have a lot of flavor.  Neither did the garlic bread. I just expected more from a place that was highly acclaimed. Too bad."
"Dining there yesterday was just so uncomfortable. We got seated upstairs and our server (dressed in a minions costume) had a pretty bad day. She was visibly upset when orders went wrong and would announce it half way before reaching the guest. One group sat down and she went over and they asked her how is she doing and the server replied ""well my tips have been crap all morning because orders have been messing up so that's how it's going."" It was so uncomfortable hearing that and being only 3ft away from the table. In another instance we heard her telling a group she apologized for their incorrect order and said ""it's not my fault, it's her fault. She messed up the order"" pointing to the other server (dressed in a devil costume) and left the section. We looked at the serve in the devil costume and she was visibly upset and looked like she was on the verge of crying. We felt soo bad. Lastly, our server was speaking to who seems to be the manager and complaining about how orders have been messing up all morning. In this situation, this should be handled at the back of the house. NOT in front of guests. Listen, I know we all have an off day but you deal with it privately and away from your guests. I work for one of the biggest restaurant groups in the city, and if this happened at any of our restaurants you would've been removed immediately. Don't make your guests feel uncomfortable, that's probably a part of the reason you weren't getting tips."
"I will start this by saying I love their pizza. We order from Pequods almost once a week. It's our favorite pizza delivery in Chicago and has been for the past few years.However, the last four deliveries have all had issues. A few weeks ago, they forgot to bring the delicious, amazing ranch we paid for. Sure, it's only ranch, but it complements the food so well :)The next time, the toppings were wrong. We ended up calling and the manager reluctantly fired a new pizza and we waited another hour-ish for the correct pizza.Last weekend, after waiting almost 2.5 hours, we found out the girl who took our order entered the wrong phone number. The driver came back and told us he was here an hour ago but couldn't get ahold of us since the wrong number was entered.Tonight, they once again forgot the ranch we paid for. I sent them an email outlining what has happened the past four times and received what most would consider a garbage response. The manager/owner/whoever sent incomplete sentences basically saying that they have a new delivery ordering system and they are working out the kinks. Sorry about that. In the end, I would NOT recommend ordering delivery from them for some time. If you need some Pequods, dine in or pick it up. Their delivery system now is whack."
Ok so I eat here all the time! I LOVE THIS PLACE and I NEVER got around to review it. So today I called to make a call ahead order and I was told they no longer do that. Mind you I am traveling an hour to eat here So I called back and asked if I ordered for a pick-up could I eat it there and his response was that He doesn't see a problem with it especially since they weren't  busy or there wasn't a wait. So I gave it a go I am giving them a 2 star review because the food is amazing but today I experienced the worst management encounter in my life.Upon arrival I told the hostess I was there for a pickup. She walked away to check on my order then when she came back I asked her if I could just eat there since there were MULTIPLE open tables and NO wait. I was told that we couldn't eat our pickup pizza there even though we were going to order drinks and app and of course  tip the server.The woman who spoke with me was very rude and after canceling the order she told me I was able to eat it there. UNBELIEVABLE!Pictures are from my last visit. Obviously not today since we left.Also I brought my cousin who is in from the Army FROM GERMANY to eat here and he was very upset that we couldn't eat here BUT we ended up going to a VERY well known establishment couple miles away for Pizza Pot Pie that he LOVED!
"This review is strictly for their delivery services. It has nothing to do w the quality of their pizza.For the past month or so, I have ordered a pan pizza every weekend. I love it. I crave it and they are reasonably priced. However... each time I have ordered it, they'd f*^%#} it up. Literally, every. Single. Time. Two of the four weekends they forgot part of the order listed on the ticket attached to the box.One time they made It with wrong ingredients so I had a pizza delivered and had to wait another 2 hours for the correct one to be delivered.And the 4th one they delivered my pizza to the wrong address so we had to wait longer again.All of these issues stemmed in the last month or so. We never had them before. We've emailed management and they respond as if they don't care with phrases like, ""wish I knew what happened..."" uhhhh I just told you? But okay. As my favorite pizza place in Chicago, I may need to hunt for a new one. A more reliable one. This is to the point where I feel I am sacrificing what I really want (my order) for whatever they feel like giving me. And that's no way to order pizza on Friday night! If you're ordering from them. Quadruple check your order on the phone and if they arrive without it.... be ready to wait another two hours for the (fingers crossed) correct order to show up!"
"Where do I begin!? let's start off by saying that I've heard nothing but great things about this place.. yet have had two crappy experiences. Two weeks ago, after boating we decided to order some pizza, everyone raved about pequods, so I decided to call in an order. After being on hold for 20 min, I finally got through and placed an order for 2 large pizzas. The girl said 2 hours for delivery.. WTF? Fair enough.. we shall wait, over 2 hours pass and nothing.. I call, on hold for 10 min, finally to have he girl say .. ""Sorry, we canceled your order, we don't deliver to the harbor anymore"" WHAT!!????? We've been waiting for 2 hours!? Why didn't someone call me or say that!? She apologized and hung up, mind you. I fought with them and my bank for a week because they STILL CHARGED ME! Fast forward to last night. Again, we want pizza after boating. We see our boat neighbors had pequods and they said it was delivered .. WTF! I call in an order and they said ""we don't deliver to the harbor."" I say, my neighbors just got delivery! She puts me on hold then processed to take my order... Like REALLY! They delivery when they want!? Anywho... I place an order and her quoted TWO HOURS! We wait, we wait and finally our BURNED PIZZAS ARRIVE! 2 hours and $80 later, our pizza arrived, everyone was super excited and starved and we open the boxes to three burned pizzas. LIKE WOW. Had to eat around the burned crust. Super disappointing .. and I ordered HOT wings and got BBQ. What a JOKE. Will never order again and will make sure to tell all of my dock neighbors to not bother with this establishment."
"Yikes, oh have the mighty fallen? My last visit was for the personal cheese deep dish and also a medium pepperoni.It is my regret to inform all the pizza aficionados my taste buds have either evolved to dislike the pizza, or they have revamped their portions, skimping out on the cheese, sauce and toppings.Most of the pizza was corn meal bread. It was absolutely disgusting, but the personal deal is 5 bucks or less.I ate half the personal pizza but couldn't find a way to finish it unfortunately.Restaurant didn't carry vinaigrette dressing for the small salad -- just oil and vinegar. Maybe the Morton grove location is better now?"
"I was pretty disappointed by Pequod's as this was my first time ever getting REAL Chicago Deep Dish pizza in Chicago. My friend who's an IL native suggested we go to Pequod's over the other deep dish places because she preferred them over Giordano's or Lou Malnati's. We showed up on a Monday right when they opened at 11AM and were seated right away in an empty (and dark) dining area. We each got an individual pizza (7"") which was a cheap $4.95 with the purchase of a soft drink for their lunch special. I asked the server for topping recommendations, who suggested sausage or pepperoni. So we each got one of those. The pizza took 40 minutes to cook, even despite being one of the first few customers in the restaurant. Not sure if that's the usual length of time it takes to cook the pizza or if the wait gets worse the busier the place. When it came out, it was un-applaudingly small and served in the original deep dish pan. Had a very dark, borderline-burnt crust which I assumed was melted cheese held under the broiler. You could get four ""slices"" out of that one individual size. The taste of the pizza itself: too saucy, not enough cheese, few chunks of sausage, and the crust was essentially like a plain dry-fluffy foccacia bread. You could say I was disappointed, as the only reference of deep dish I had previously was Uno's Chicago grill pizza which I have to say tastes better than this, though their tomato sauce is a little too sweet. Wouldn't say I was blown away by this one, and hope I can try a larger selection of REAL deep dish the next time I come back to IL."
"It looks like a deep dish pizza in pictures, but if the crust is 90% of the thickness, is it a true deep dish? That is exactly what you get with the pan pizza - a thick bread with sauce and toppings on top.. pretty much the opposite of how Gio's and Lou's does it. The worst part was that the toppings were not even cooked (probably because they were sprinkled on top rather than being baked into the pizza). Our mushrooms and onion were basically raw and was pretty nasty to eat tbh. The crust was also badly blackened and had a bad rubbery texture.. we couldn't even eat it.The Pequods salad is also extremely basic. It's just simple lettuce and onion topped with pepperoni and cheese in the shape of a whale. Not worth the $10."
"I had a terrible experience their on Sunday.  I got off worked picked up my family and went to try their pizza. Was our first time we got there at 1645 and they were busy, we got sat immediately. Our server came up for us about 5-10minutes after sitting and by then we already knew what we wanted because we know deep dish usually takes a while. So we ordered apps and Pizza. The server told us it would take about 45 minutes for the pizza which we were okay with. After 45 minutes we started to wonder but tried to be patient. A table that came after us got their pizza before us so I called the server over and she said shes going to check what happened to our pizza. Keep in mind we've already waited a hour. She came back and said the pizza has only been 20 minutes I said that's not true then she checked and saw we ordered at 4.58. So she said shes going to get a manager and find out what happen. Another 10 minutes later she came and told us they burnt out pizza and it would take another amount of time for us to get another. By then we're starving so I asked her for the check for the soda and appetizers. She brought the check which still had the pizza on it. I told her I'm not paying for the pizza because we never got it. She removed it and we left. I just feel like it's terrible communication, she could've informed me about the status of our pizza."
"Pequod's used to be the #1 spot for deep dish pizza. I'd bring relatives here, business clients, dates too. The kitchen integrity of work has declined. I've had several pies where the crust just fell right off so the pie didn't stay intact. Disappointing for sure but taste was about the same."
"This is not real Chicago deep dish pizza. It is pan pizza like from Pizza Hut. I do not like the spongey tasteless crust that comes mass quantity in too high a ratio to the sauce (strangely peppery) and cheese. I also hate anything remotely burnt, and burnt crusty cheese on the outside edges counts as burnt in my book. They also gave our order to the wrong table so we had to wait TWICE as long for them to bring us another one. The interior was cute, so there...that's ONE nice thing I can say about this place."
Ordered their food and was so disappointed.  Their salad is literally a few pieces of lettuce and some slices of cheese and pepperoni.  Literally no effort; if I raided a grocery store during a zombie apocalypse I could make a better salad.  Also they forgot one of the expensive toppings on my pizza; may as well just buy a frozen pizza and assemble my own toppings.
"Not only is the pizza one sloppy mess, but they show ZERO hospitality. We ordered a pizza to go, and within 5 minutes called to add wings and salad to our order. The woman on the phone said that they couldn't add anything, even salad, to our order after the pizza had gone in the oven! What? She was rude, short and irritable. We actually called 15 minutes later and placed another order with a different name to get around the system.  And on top of all this, they didn't even get my order right! Let me get an AMEN if you are done with this over rated, over priced, underwhelming sports bar. go cubs"
Really mediocre pizza IMO. Salad looked like it came from a bag. Really loud and staff was arguing with each other in hallway. It is pretty affordable which is really the only positive. Wouldn't recommend.
This pizza was just ok. Crust was good but the sauce didn't taste fresh at all :(Prefer Lou Malnati's to this any day. Also the location lacks ambiance... it's very dark and there is no natural light. Would not return here.
"I'm so disappointed! I use to LOVE this place. I came here a few weeks back and asked for a table for three, including my toddler. I wanted a booth and was rudely told no because I could not put a high chair on the edge of the booth, which I understood. I told the hostess that I would go without the high chair. I just wanted to sit in a booth rather a table. The tables are located in the middle of the restaurant where you get hit with everyone's coats as they pass by. She said something under here breath, walked us to our table and literally threw the menus on the table. As she walked away, she called me a b*tch in spanish, probably not knowing I spoke spanish. Usually if I'm unhappy with the service I just won't go back but I was so mad I just had to speak with the manager. When the manager came to our table, he was laughing and distracted by other employees. He seemed very young and uninterested in what I was saying to him. I don't expect great service from a pizza joint but the plain disrespect is uncalled for. I love the pizza here but I will never return and I'll make sure to spread the word."
"Unfortunately, as a potential new customer there, we spoke w ""Katie"" who I will add,  initially said she was the ""delivery coordinator "" and she was simply rude and couldn't answer a simple question about delivery logistics without fully listening and before cutting me off ; ""I just asked you for what time?!"" Pardon?! and then ""accidentally"" disconnected call . When I called back I explained to call taker we were just trying to gage if maybe best if we should pick up rather than waiting over an hour?!  And I explained I wanted to speak to the manager Bc of the lack of customer service and how abrupt/rude Ms. Katie is. And what do you know folks ""Katie"" gets on phone and is now the Manager too! LOL! Cmon. Make up your mind. Certainly could recognize the voice immediately. Either way, hence the ""first time customer"" simply asking questions."
I come from New York and new haven pizza so I was excited to experience the deep dish life. I swear this was a notch down from school cafeteria pizza. The sauce tasted like ketchup. The crust was just doughy and had zero flavor. It felt like a pizza you make using Pillsbury crust and the lowest grade cheese. Super disappointed
"I have NEVER in my life had such terrible service... I called at 6:30 to order food. I was told 1 hour 15 minutes for wait time. Not bad for a Saturday night?? I arrive at 7:45 to pickup my pizza and they tell me it's almost ready. LOL I just got my pizza at 9:10pm. They make you pay as soon as you arrive and then they never give you time updates. When they handed me my pizza, I let her know my wings were missing.. she told me sorry you didn't pay for wings. So I asked her to print my receipt and guess what was on there? WINGS.  She threw my receipt at me and 15 minutes later brought out the rest of my food. I'm sure the food is great, haven't had a chance to eat it but the staff and and organization is so terrible that I will never eat there again. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! Worst experience yet in Chicago."
"Don't bother reserving ""priority seating"" because it doesn't make a difference. Two groups of 8 show up 30 seconds apart. One called ahead. Can you guess who got sat first???Update: Took 40 minutes to be sat with ""priority seating."" Pitcher of beer we were given was not what we asked for. Had to ask several times to get get plates for the group we had. Had to ask several times to get forks for the table. Asked for half pepperoni half cheese and was given whole cheese. But they said a medium cheese pizza was being made to fix the mistake, which took an additional 25 minutes to get to us. I've never been so disappointed with a restaurant before. Failure on all accounts; host, server, bartender, cooks, they literally all failed on our table. I'm sad about it cuz I love the pizza but the service was so bad I may not return."
"Pretty terrible all around. There are so many great deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago, it's a waste of money and time to eat here. Dirty restaurant,  duck taped booths, dirty tables. Nothing charming about this place. The TVs all had news with rape and murder broadcasting across the screens so we had to ask our 10 year old to not look at all the glaring TVs. Waitress was slightly nice, but sick with a cold. Salad was brown and wilty with terrible ranch. Worst fried zucchini I've ever tasted. Terrible beer and wine list. Pizza is way too bready with the old Italian seasoning thrown in. Not enough cheese and sauce like traditional Chicago deep dish. Out of the way location. Please don't waste your money here."
"Visiting from California.Nothing about this place was good. The pizza was the worst pizza I've ever had and that's saying a lot especially since this place was supposed to be Chicago's best pizzeria. I ordered a certain style of pizza, I received the completely opposite. I don't eat meat and the pizza came loaded with pepperoni, I guess for some that a good problem, yet for me it wasn't. The flavor was bland, the sauce didn't have enough spices and the cheese wasn't melted enough. I wouldn't eat here again, nor recommend anyone coming from out of town to eat here if they want good pizza."
"Complete and utter ridiculous policies and moron working the door. Can't accommodate no matter what, no give no take. Open tables and can't seat 2 children and an adult. Ridiculous and unacceptable. Open larger tables but reused to seat do to holding it for larger parties. The pizza here is typically great but their seating policies are crap. Won't let you order a pie while you're waiting for a table to expedite and be efficient. Completely upside down and backwards I came across the city and will not return. Not worth the parking headache, traffic, or senseless host. If there is a 30 minute wait and a 40 minute sign for pie, why not allow ordering? It'd turn your table faster. Crappy customer service, poor business efficiencies, good pie if you want to accept their BS seating."
"I am writing this review more in terms of customer service rather than that of the quality of the food. We are frequent patrons of Pequod's Pizzeria and are apart of the community; however, I was unaware that this was not a family friendly place. We went to Pequod's at 6pm and were fine with the more than hour to hour and a half wait; however, once the time had expired we were met with an unfriendly host who had an attitude and prompted a very negative interaction and left a very negative view of the customer service we receive at Pequod's. As much as we love this pizza I do not feel we'll ever feel comfortable at this establishment."
I am more than willing to wait two hours for pizza but was extremely disappointed by what I was served. The crust was somehow rock hard yet when you finally chisel a piece away it tasted like undercooked corn meal. I am shocked this place made so many best of chicago lists.
Got here on a Sunday night and the wait was about an hour. I've waited longer for food so I'm not that mad. Got seated up stairs and placed our order right away. Got cheese sticks for apps which were really good. Order a medium pan pizza with sausage and green peppers. I can tell they use fresh ingredients cause the green peppers tasted fresh. But here come the bad. The pizza had no flavor to me. It was just blend. Some bits I had were good but overall just blah! The ratio is completely off. There is just too much bread. Is that what a pan pizza is like? If so I'll pass on all pan pizza. Overall the place is cool but I truly can not understand what people see in this pizza. It's actually terrible. And don't get me started with the left overs: it's even worst when you reheat it up. Oh the sausage was great though but I wish there was more.
"I was struggling to decide whether to go to this place or Lou Malnati's or Giordano's before I went to this place because I only had time to check out one of them. Eventually picked this place because my friends highly recommended this. I went there for lunch by myself. The lunch deal was really cheap (~$7 for 7""pan cheese pizza with two toppings and a drink). I had high expectations before I came here but the quality was just so-so. It reminded me of Pizza Hut pizza with a thicker crust. Was disappointed. I had deep dish pizza at Paxti's in San Francisco and I like that better. Sidenote: ordered diet coke but it had a weird taste, drank only a sip."
"Pequods uses low quality ingredients. Not convinced? Order a thin crust pizza and see how greasy it is.Their gimmick is the carmelized crust, which after you have once you realize is gummy and just not good. Look, those that know pizza, know that Pequods is one thing - and that's all HYPE. One final comment - I have never seen a filthier establishment. Garbage is everywhere."
"I don't care how good your pizza is... if you're rude to first time customers and make them feel unwelcome, you get one star.  We were fully prepared to wait, but being told it would be 45 min to get a buzzer and then 3 hours after getting a buzzer is insane.  That isn't even accurate, it is simply an attempt to drive business away. Shame on you for having such an elitist practice."
"AVOID DELIVERY at all costs...Let me preface this review by saying that I love Pequod's pizza. It's one of my favorite (if not my favorite) pan pizzas of all time.  However, their delivery is horrendous.  I've ordered delivery about 6 times from Pequods. 3 of those times, there have been major issues with the delivery.First of all, delivery takes a while. But they're up front about it. I can live with that. The issue comes in when there are problems with the order itself. Usually when someplace makes a mistake, they own up to it and fix the problem as quickly as possible. Pequods does neither of those things. Let me elaborate on this with respect to today/tonight. From start to ""resolution"" was almost 5 hours. I placed the order at 4 and was told that the order would come in about 2 hours.  It came in a bit less time. Great!  Unfortunately, the salad I ordered was missing.  I called back and eventually got through to a manager who was fairly dismissive and gave me the choice of voiding the salad or having it delivered. I opted to have it delivered, to which she responded by saying that they were very busy and she wasn't sure when we'd get it.  Ok.  This was 6 pm. Fast forward to 8:45. Still no salad and no update.  So I called back and after waiting for about 10 minutes on hold, I finally got an update. The first salad wasn't made (we knew this otherwise, they would have just brought it).  The second was made but the delivery person forgot it on his way out.  This seemed a bit suspect to me, and of course no one will fess up as to whether the salad ever did exist, but what can you do.  In the end, I got through to another manager who offered comping the salad and a $25 gift card for the a future order. I told her that I wanted the entire bill comped given the trouble I'd had. She said that half the bill was the best she could, and I accepted. I told her that I'd never order from Pequods again, to which she responded ok, we're sorry to lose a customer. It seemed insincere.Long story short, Pequods needs to improve their delivery significantly.  50% success is not acceptable and no one should feel like they've done something wrong when they haven't. The bill should have been comped."
"It's the most overrated pizza place in Chicago - no matter how good the pizza is, I would never wait over 90 minutes for my dinner. Period. My last time there."
We were waiting for two hours to be steated and one more hour till we got one of the deep dish pizzas. Pizza was just soso and definitely not worth it to wait three hours.
Ordered pizza and I was delivered a burnt pizza. My first time in Chicago and everyone praised how amazing they are so I ordered and I got this charred pizza!
"Ok so I'm just going to get right into this:The pizza is so disappointing. If you're in Chicago for a few days and are in the mood to try deep dish I would avoid this. The reason I'm saying that is because it is seriously just all crust. So much bread and very little topping. To have an equal balance of both is preferred but the proportions were way off. They bring it out in a skillet and honestly it was over cooked. I don't want slightly charred pizza at all. Maybe I'm being a snob about this since I come from NYC and we are all about the pizza (albeit thin crust or ""regular""). The sausage was good but the pieces were so thick that they had only put 3. Instead of spread it around by cutting it into smaller pieces.The seating was ok, there are two large floors which is helpful although the wait to sit was about an hour and the wait for our pizza almost another hour. Half of our floor was empty for good reason since there was no AC! So a hot kitchen putting off hot air onto the top floor of a building is not fun at all. I do like that you get to customize your pizza in terms of size and toppings. That's wonderful. I also loved the Whale Tale next door. The service was also wonderful and a good selection of drinks. But I will not recommend this place unless someone I know is really in the mood for a lot of bread."
"My husband and I were disappointed by the pizza here. After going to Lou malnatis (which was so delicious!)  we were told by the locals to go here saying it was amazing and it's where all the locals go for deep dish pizza. Honestly, the wait itself wasn't bad. We were told the wait would be 20-45 minutes then another 60 minutes for the pizza to be made. I think we waited 15 min to be seated and maybe 40 minutes for the pizza to come out. And this was Sunday night around 530. They also let you wait at a bar two doors down the block if the restaurant bar is full. We ordered a small sausage mushroom pan pizza. The pizza was not hot at all. My husband and I were actually able to touch the pizza pan with our whole hand and it felt just warm. I don't know why they had to carry it or with the special tong things. The pizza dough was so THICK. It's like a 4:1 ratio. I'm not even sure it was baked fully cuz I thought it tasted a bit soggy. The sausage tasted overwhelmingly of fennel seeds. The only compliment we had was that they used real mushrooms instead canned. We walked out agreeing we liked the broccoli cheddar bites we had at the bar next door while waiting for our table."
"So normally this place is on point when it comes to pizza (thin and deep dish) but I ordered a thin crust last night (7/28/17) and I think the cook was mad at life or something and took it out on my order. I ordered fried mushrooms, a 12 inch thin crust with meatball, mushroom, & onion, a can of Coke & a can of Sprite. -1The Price: First of all that all came out to $40 prior to the tip (yikes) so I expected the normal magical unicorn dust flavors that Pequod's produces for the price. Nay kind Sir or Madam reader, here's how pizza night went downhill fast...-1The Appetizer: Well the mushrooms had breading that was too salty, and the mushrooms themselves had a weird after taste; like someone spit cinnamon Big Red gum in them before breading them!-1The Pizza: The pizza itself was a whole other hot mess: too much flavorless sauce and an ABUNDANCE of onions. I like onions...but I don't know anyone who likes them this much. I mean they were under the cheese, in the cheese & then for the piece de resistance, on top of the cheese. It looked like someone loaded a tee shirt cannon with onions and shot it on the pizza dead center. As for the meatballs (which should have been the star) it looked like someone took ah(uno/one) meatball chopped it into millionths and then placed the meatball dust on the pizza. The crust was thick and soooper dry. It sapped all the moisture out of my mouth like a 3ply industrial paper towel once it hit my tongue. The abundance of sauce should have helped the crust situation but again if you recall it was flavorless & tasted tinny. It tasted almost as though the sauce went from can to pizza. This all made for a terrible Friday pizza night. I know you guys get busy but everything is still usually always at the top of the pizza game. I don't want to believe that Pequod's is slipping because it's normally fantastic, but the only thing that tasted right in this order were the cans of pop! So one of you guys need to pop back into the kitchen and give the dude (or dudette) that preps your pizza a hug & a raise or something before this type of quality becomes a Pequod's standard."
"We ordered several deep dish pizzas for take away last week and were told they would be ready in an hour. When we arrived to pick them up they had not even begun cooking our order -- so had to wait another hour. When we brought the pizzas home, we were again disappointed -- the crust was over an inch thick and tasteless -- I could have done a way better job for a fraction of the cost. I doubt I will bother with Pequods again."
"We came all the way from New York. We were recommended by a local friend who said that this place has the best Chicago style deep dish pizza. First impression - wait time is extremely long. We have been waiting for 2 hour and 45 mins. The hostess at front kept telling us that you are next. However, we 5 people, were standing right next to her and saw another group of 5 just came in. And the same hostess led their way to seating. We were shocked and felt it was very rude. She still kept saying that you are next and the other group has priority seating - which we never heard of or you forget to tell us?? If we are not next, please just be honest. Because the other group are Caucasians, and we are Asians? You honestly treated us differently because we kept seeing people behind us were seated. Second, after almost 3 hour wait, you give us the table for 4 people. We are group of 5. We seated - very uncomfortable and crowded. We saw the table behind us - which can fit 5 people, we politely asked the waitress - can we switch to that table? Because they are done. The waitress says that she has to ask the front. Shortly she came back and said to us that - that 5 people table need to give for group of more people. Excuse me? We saw 5 people just sitting there and they left. And you told us that table need to wait for more than 5 people? So the entire time we were sitting at 4 people table and we saw the table behind us - which can fit 5 people was empty the whole time. This is unacceptable and the worst dining experience. We never ever receive this service at New York ever! This is very disappointed."
"I don't get the hype at all. Maybe my experience was uncharacteristic but this pizza had about an inch thick crust with barely any sauce or cheese. They were generous with the pepperoni, but honestly it was too dry and sad of a pie for that to save it."
"Never order delivery from these idiots.   They screwed up the order by putting jalapeño peppers on my pizza.  Then when I called the manager tried to give me a credit for a future  pizza and assume that I should just eat pizza with jalapeño peppers.  I explained these would make me sick.  He said they would send another pizza in an hour.  It has been 90 minutes and no second pizza.  They do not answer my calls.  Note that drivers have no change.  Another reason not to do business with this disreputable company.  I've eaten in the restaurant several times and the pizza is great.  When it's busy they fail at customer service.  To be fair, a manager contacted me Video yelp to try to straighten this message out. However his efforts were pathetic. He stated that he wanted to resolve the issue but stood with his manager who banned me.  Then invited me to return. When I pointed out that I did not want to go in there and then be asked to leave, he did not continue the conversation.  While I understand that yelling and using profanity is no way to resolve a situation, they seem to think nk that people should just quietly take being ignored and mistreated when they make mistakes.  I did not get angry until my second or third call three hours after the ordeal began.  Their system has no way of tracking mistakes and service recovery efforts. So I stand by my original advice to not order delivery from them."
"I grew up in the Chicago area, so Pequod's has had a special place in my heart for a long time, and I've gladly eaten it like 6 times in the past few months. However, last night was the last time I'll be there. My group of 5 arrived and was told there'd be a 30-45 minute wait, so we eventually took our buzzer and went to the bar next door to wait. After a period of less than 5 minutes, in which no alcohol was consumed (because we'd barely even been seated), our buzzer went off and we took our seats at Pequod's. Some of my party members wanted beer to start off, and our whole table was refused alcohol service, eventually citing one of our friends as the reason after we pried for justification. As everybody there had years of restaurant experience we understand the rules and procedures. The problem is that the basis for their claim that we were over-served was our friend's speech and movement, which is actually her regular speech and movement and is related to physical trauma from months ago. After explaining this to management, they stuck to their decision and offered no acknowledgement that this may be offensive or discriminatory. Our friend was saddled with the guilt of being the reason we all left the restaurant in anger. This could have, and should have been handled with much more tact. It is situations like this that often get hospitality businesses into legal trouble, and Pequod's management needs an attitude fix to avoid this in the future. It's a real shame we all grew up loving this place, but now there's a stain on our memory of it. The manager we dealt with gave us the name Joel."
"I understand taste and preference is an individual experience, but I have had better pizza.  I prefer Due and that type of crust.Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good, it's the management that is a problem.  My assistant booked a reservation for me and a few clients - one just in from Scotland that very day.  We arrived 20 minutes early.  We were told we would probably not be seated for more than an hour.  When we pressed that we had a reservation, we were told that we were put on a list, but the seating time is not guaranteed.  I assure you, this was not communicated when the ""reservation"" was made.  An hour later, we were still seated outside, waiting.  My assistant called and asked to speak to the manager (I didn't force her or anything, she was upset with the whole situation - I had also talked to the management myself).  The manager told her we were not there. She had to describe what we were wearing.  Now, the manager had already been outside, called our party's name and we replied accordingly.  He walked back inside.  So, he knew we were there, told my assistant we weren't and it was officially an issue.  Twenty minutes later, the manager came out, said he was sorry for the confusion, assigned blame to my assistant and we were seated.  Unless you have all day to wait or just don't mind, Pequod's has tasty pizza.   Personally, the management's ruined the experience and we won't be back."
Order the deep dish To Go and the pizza was 95% all crust-very little cheese and sauce. It was good but due to the overwhelming amount of crust I would have to say this is my least favorite Chicago deep dish pizza. My first experience was dine in and we loved it so not sure if dine in vs pickup is the difference.  Are they skimping on the cheese and the sauce totally or only pickup?  The whole group was disappointed and especially me for suggesting.
"Long wait, less than average burnt taste pizza, horrible slow staff. I was so excited to try but left in much disappointment. It started as a 20 minute wait that actually was 1.5 hours. Bartender was more interested in getting the single guys number over serving drinks. Then to wait another 50 minutes for bad burnt pizza. I won't be back."
"I was prepared for a wait, so when I called for delivery and was quoted an hour and a half, I was cool with that. 2 1/2 hours and multiple phone calls later, our pizza arrived.And if the pizza was amazing, the wait would have been mostly forgiven. But it was not amazing. I'm sure the fact that it had been sloshing around in a warming bag in the delivery guy's car for an hour didn't help, but the pizza sucked. The bottom crust was super thick, super flavorless, and a mysterious combo of crumbly and mushy. The sauce and the sausage were good, but the rest of the toppings were generic, boring, and in the case of the garlic, still super raw. If you have to eat here, I'd recommend eating in the restaurant, but I've had significantly better pizza at a number of other Chicago places, so I'd give this one a miss."
"You've got to be kidding me. Fucking seriously. LOL this ""pizza"" is a joke.This place deserves negative one star. I hate writing bad reviews because these establishments have real people working to make a living. But I am appalled by the number of fake positive reviews and inflated rating.None of these people here who give good reviews of this place have probably ever had real good pizza. I don't get the raving great reviews and horribly regret going here. Of all the good places to go eat, we went here and had to go out of our way to get here, in hopes the pizza would be delicious. It took us a 30 minute drive from downtown to come to this rickety area. That is usually a good sign but not for this place.There was a very slim layer of cheese on the pizza. It was 90% bread, 9.99% sauce and maybe close to 1 % of actual cheese. It tasted more like a burnt garlic bread, minus the good flavor. I shouldve went to the grocery store and bought some Texas toast. Would've been worth it more than this atrocious round bread.Please take a look at my pictures of the pie we received. It looks nothing like a pizza. And tastes nothing like one.To make a long story short: the waitress was so dismissive and oblivious half the time. She forgot we needed to order ( you have one job) then tried to be abnormally fake, extra sweet to our toddler. So much so that even he said he didn't want to be there.The atmosphere was more like a pub or bar. It reeked of stale liquor and was dark, and cramped. Such a joke. Not to mention THE 40 MINUTES IT TOOK TO MAKE IT.40 minutes??? To burn some bread?? LOL. okay.You want pizza???? Real nice, thick, cheesy, goey, delicious pizza??? Go to colorado and try the pizza at Old Chicago.I guess the famous ""chicago"" pizza is only good by it's name, not by the actual location."
"I was visiting from out of town and was so excited to try ""deep dish pizza"". Unfortunately I won't be back. My order was just okay. I wasn't moved. The order took a long time but that's good to know it's freshly made. The caramelized crust is unique  but the pizza was way too bready and more more on the dry side not enough sauce but I did like the thin crust pizza better. Customer service was really good and the place was cozy! Really appreciated the buss boy who brought out our pizza and cut it and put it on a plate for us."
Family and I went on a Wednesday.   Busy busy busy Good:   Pizza was good hot and had a nice flavor Bad: was not able to preorder said it wouldn't.  Help w/ wait.   Once we got in we placed order.    Waited about 40 min.   To get sat.  Then pizza took about 35 min.    Ther was a major screw up.   As 3 tables sat after us and. Got pizzas around same time. When we asked about the status of our order it came out Side note :   Pizza was not good next day Won't go again
Sorry but pequod's lost their recipe when the millenials took over in the kitchen. I remember it being way better. Thin crust was actually thin and the sauce was really good. Nothing to brag about. I went there the other day with a friend and took a lot of shots for it not being the awesome pizza everyone rants and raves over. And how about some air conditioning when its Florida weather. Dont just open up the front door. I know people are drunk but it's still hot asf!
"Decided to go visit the Pequod on North Clybourn Avenue after the movies. The host began to lead us to the upstairs section. I requested to be seated downstairs since my boyfriend couldn't walk up the steep, what appeared to be at least a 20 step staircase. The host refused and began to explain that they were only seating guests upstairs since they wanted to give the wait staff a final rush. The restaurant had PLENTY of open seating in the lower level. Upon requesting for the manager, the manager sternly said this is a regular procedure. After discussing several options with the manager on-duty. He finally agreed to let us sit at the bar, place an order and wait for his server downstairs to get off of her 20 minute break before moving to a table on the main level. 2 minutes after sitting at the bar, looking over the menu. Another handful of guests began to trickle into the restaurant. After another minute, he screamed ""Busy (another hostess's name), take them to table 7."" Three additional groups after us were immediately guided to seats on the lower level. WTF. Aren't restaurants in business to serve customers and maximize efficient table turns? Perhaps this place needs to reconsider their 'policies'. Here is my point. You had open seats with at least 12 tables open, why couldn't your patrons who clearly expressed the inability to walk up the flight of stairs not be accommodated. All this angst was uncalled for and has made this visit most likely my last visit."
"I had guests over on a Sunday night and had called the night before to place the order. On Sunday morning, I called to remove a pizza as some guests were not going to be able to stop by. The pizza was supposed to come at 7pm, it did not come until 8. By that time the crust was extremely soggy and the pizza was lukewarm. When the driver handled me the receipt, it still listed all three pizzas (and the price for 3) despite the fact that he only had the two. He assured me that they were working on the refund for the pizza I asked them to remove. A few days later the charge posted and didn't reflect the refund so I called to ask. The manager assured me the refund should post by Friday and told me to wait. I checked today and no refund had posted. I called again today and the manager informed me that no one on their end had worked on a refund nor put any notes about a refund in the system. He first incorrectly told me that ordered 4 pizzas and received 3, which was not the case. After needing to walk him through it, he finally initiated what I hope to be an actual refund. This should not have taken this many calls and due diligence on my end to remedy their mistake. Extremely unprofessional, don't waste your time here. Get Lou's instead."
"Service, wait and taste of pizza has all changed for the worse. There is better out there. This place used to be awesome. What a shame!"
Not really impressed. We were seated upstairs. It was really hot. I mean no A/C hot. Service was good but pizza was just ok.
"No restaurant is more overrated in the city than Pequod's. Growing up down the street, knowing people that have worked there, and even dating a die-hard fan, I just don't get it. Thick, heavy, BURNT and dry are all of the textures and qualities I get from Pequod's. Long waits, loud angry suburban patrons and rude waiters trudge through the hype to an expensive, and unpleasant dining experience. Last time I made the mistake of visiting we tried some wings, which, alike the pizza, were dry and disappointing. The had the added bonus of having a generic taste to them as well.For me, even the chains like Uno and Lous beat Pequod's, but Exchequer will always have my heart."
"This was crazy. 4 hours for delivery and couldn't get a response other than traffic, meanwhile there's 3 different ways to get where I was. When I tried calling, I could get to speak with someone. Noticed there's a trend from other comments on here about delivery service.While visiting from the east coast and being disappointed by the other well known deep dish (Lou M...), this was just as disappointing. Maybe because it took forever, it was soggy and not crispy, but either way, so doughy. While flavorful, it wasn't worth it IMO..."
"One Star delivery serviceMy buddy and I had one of the most terrible pizza deliveries ever last night. Pizza came 20 min late after a 1.5 hr original estimate, so nearly two hours wait which we were both totally prepared for to get an excellent pizza. When the pie finally did arrive, the bottom of the box was completely soggy as if it had been resting in a puddle for an hour and the delivery driver offered some free cheese bread as a consolation. In most cases we probably wouldn't even have eaten it, but we were starving and out $45 so we are it. It was disgustingly soggy as you can imagine.We'll never order delivery here again and I don't recommend any one else does either. Damn shame because the place can put out a damn good pizza (or at least they used to)"
"I had bad stomachache and diarrhea after eating there. Pizza was ok, not impressive, BBQ wings were terrible, covered with sticky sauce and very salty. The wings are probably the reason I had diarrhea, because my husband didn't have it and he's fine.Edit: The restaurant reached me back and apologized to me with good attitude"
"Walked in super excited to end my Chicago trip on a bang with Pequods as my last stop so I was SUPER bummed out when I walked in with my 3 friends and all our bags and the HOST who could've been the owner glared at me, looked at the Yankees hat I was wearing, signaled with his body that we were clearly in a Chicago bar, and moodily showed us to our seats. ??? I was so thrown off by the lack of hospitality. I get city pride and I'm all about that as well. Other Than that, 4.95  is a great lunch deal. Pizza was good. Our waitress was nice. But I wouldn't come here again."
"So many people hype this place up.  I've never been happy with the pizza here.  After four experiences and four disappointments- I'm finished with this place.  Consistently inconsistent.   So many excellent deep dish places in town, this is not one."
Waited on hold for 30 minutes.... finally got through to the operator and they told me that they would not deliver to my address because I was 1 block outside the delivery radius. I told them I would walk to the block that they do deliver to (1 away from my current location) and they said that would not deliver. This **was** my favorite Chicago pizza joint but now I will not see myself going here ever again. Thanks for the memories
"We made a reservation. We called and confirmed 15 minutes before we arrived. We paid for a taxi to get to the restaurant. We arrived, and were informed that our reservation had been canceled without being notified, and that there was nothing that they would do. No apology, no attempt to accommodate, just too bad for for us. Quite a way to treat customers. There are lots of good deep dish places in Chicago. Avoid this one."
"Disappointed.  Flew into Chicago and 1st stop was Pequod's Pizzeria.  We were seated right away on Tuesday for lunch.  However we had to wait 5-10 minutes for waiter to come take our food and drink order.  We ordered the pan cheese pizza and a thin crust pizza with pineapple, mushroom and onions, a salad and french fries.   Salad and French fries came out first.  French fries were good however there was a dead fly in our salad.  We lost our appetite for salad.  So we just told them to take it away.  Pan pizza can out and it was underwhelming.  Tasted a bit dry.  However the thin crust pizza was laden with cheese and toppings.  It was very good.  I would recommend the thin crust over the pan pizza.  We had to wait another 10 minutes to get a waiter to give us the check and another 10 minutes for them to come back to process the payment. I heard a lot of great things about this place but next time I think I'll just order to go.  Service was slow and they didn't seem apologetic about finding a dead fly in our salad.  Disappointed in service and food."
"DO NOT order delivery. The first time, after waiting for three hours and receiving no pizza, I called to check on it and they said they had lost my order and that they could reorder and deliver in two hours. The second time, after waiting for two hours, the order showed up completely wrong - the ticket itself was correct, but the pizza was not at all what I ordered. I called and without missing a beat (this must happen all the time) they said they could either remake the pizza and deliver in two hours (seriously??) or give me a credit, but I couldn't have my money back. I honestly love this place and have been going for years, but the last time I ever eat there will be for free when I use that credit."
Two stars because I found a hair in my salad. The pizza was good; first time having deep dish in Chicago and I was pleased. We ordered the medium size to share between 3 people and there was leftovers. We had half pepperoni and half pepperoni and meatball. The crust was nice and crispy and there was an ample amount of toppings. Definitely a fun place with friends or chill date.
"Just wanted to confirm - went back a second time and this place is still hot garbage all around - the staff, the wait, the food. Never again will I waste my time or money here."
"Ehh not the best, I'm a local and love deep dish pizza once in a while...okay maybe three times a year because that stuff is heavy! But I wasn't a fan of the burnt crust that makes this place so popular. Which is fine because you will either love it or hate it. It's just not my cup of tea. The service was great though, they did forget a topping but were nice enough to deduct the cost of the topping and then some for the inconvenience."
"No matter what they tell you when you call in to make a reservation just know that these guys DO NOT take reservations! The lack of professionalism, and being packed in like a sardine, is not worth the wait for this pizza. Go to Lou's instead!"
"First of all don't be fooled by the pictures the topping is only two or three small slices of meet or whatever you ask for .      I had one of the worst experiences ever with one of the managers when I told them what's wrong with my pizza she said in order to fix it it'll take about 45 minuets just like what it took us to wait for it when we had to wait an hour to be seated and another 45 minuets to get the pizza. Or she will take care of it and since we waited enough we agreed that they'll take care of it, unfortunately when it was time to get the check we found that she took care of the topping that it was missing only which was the protein topped and no way I'll have a pizza with only cheese. After a long argument about what they mean by we'll take care of it they agreed to take of another topping I paid just to be done and leave it was absolutely not professional from her. Trust me It's an overrated place if I didn't have this experience to be fair I'll give them 3 stars"
"Ordered takeout on a Sunday and was told it would take 50 minutes. When I arrived, it took them 10 minutes to figure out and tell me that they had forgotten to make my pizza. Given that it is deep dish, it would be another 50 minute wait to get my pizza. They told me they would comp. the pizza (I still had to pay the tax which was weird) and deliver it free of charge. However, when it arrived, they charged me a $2.75 delivery fee. On top of it all, the pizza was way too doughy compared to other times I've had pequods and it seemed like they skimped on the toppings. Only giving them above 1 star because the carmalized crust is good, but not good enough that I'll be coming back after this poor service"
"Worst customer service. Pizzas great but management is lacking basic customer service. Long story short, I don't care how good the pizza is after my experience with management. I know my experience is a daily occurrence & the owners should be aware they're losing customers & profit due to their inability to hire employees who have common sense."
"Very disappointed, I had been here quite a few years back and thought it was ok. After the reading the hype, thought I would give it another try. It's still just ok, doesn't live up to the hype.PS: I forgot to mention this is the perfect pizza for those lactose intolerant because there is almost no cheese on this pizza."
Waited 3 hours to sit down. Then waited another hour to get a pizza inside. And the Pizza was mediocre. Worst experience in chicago.
"Went here as it was recommended to me as the best place for deep dish by ""locals"" separating it from the infamous tourist deep dish spot downtown. Pizza was nothing memorable, but my four day stay in the hospital sure was. Best tasting, most expensive salmenella ive ever had. Not insinuating, just putting it out there as a warning. Can safely say I have not been back since (it's been 3 years, still paying off hospital bills). Enjoy!"
"I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I had them on my bucket pizza list to try before I moved away from Chicago. So we ordered their pizza (despite having to do by phone because that is the only way they could take our order). The pizza took forever to get there (even by deep dish standards), and I realize that deep dish doesn't travel well (and I'm not a huge deep dish fan as it is, but again, had heard great things). In any case, I was not a fan of the pizza at all once we did get it and opened it up. If you are going to try them, definitely go in person, and hopefully it is much better than what I experienced."
"Don't get it, not sure what all the fuss is about. Somewhat average pizza, maybe its' popularity is because of its' past reputation. Tried a large tomato cheese pizza and also a pepperoni and vegetable pizza. Both were the same, lots of dough, some tomato sauce and some cheese. Not sure what all the raving is about since the dough is not very tasty. Actually the best part of the dough were the ends that touch the pan which were burnt with cheese. However overall, it was a very bready pizza. Along with that we had the Caesar salad which again was average at best.For dessert we had a brownie again average at best, it was very cakey and dry.  Being a tourist, I was very disappointed, as I expected much more. In fact I've tried a deep dish from the Uno's chain and found it to be superior. I guess I've been there, and done that, but not worth a return visit.  Sorry to lambaste a Chicago institution but I honestly was expecting a lot more."
"We just spent $35 dollars on disappointment. We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushroom on Memorial Day for delivery. At first, I thought somehow my fiancé had just gotten sauce on the box, himself, and the table. I open the box to find most of the pizza was sauce and dough. We each ate a slice, and then decided the rest wasn't worth eating. We were both hungry and pausing between bites. This really didn't taste anything like the pizza we had at Pequod's before. The following weekend we had a frozen pizza from Costco that was a million times better. What we learned from our $35 dollars of disappointment: do not order delivery from Pequod's. Did I mention we waited close to two hours for this pizza?"
"Hate to be harsh, but I found it totally meh ... Went for lunch today around 12:45PM, and it was a 40-minute wait. Sadly, I don't think it was worth it. Ordered the large cheese pan pizza, and here's how I would describe it: was mainly a crust, with a doughy ""filling"", and then a very thin layer of tomato sauce on top. It comes out kinda burnt too. Where was the cheese? Not sure that this is true deep dish pizza. And while I realize it was a cold day, it was so cold inside the restaurant that we - and everyone else dining - were wearing our coats while eating. (We ate downstairs so hopefully it's different/better upstairs.) On the plus side, our waitress was friendly and attentive, you get free refills on your soda, and the cheesy garlic bread and mozzarella sticks (ordered as appetizers) were fine. Alas, after all the hype, I don't feel the need to come back, as there have got to be better pizza options in this great food city of ours ..."
"In the last couple of years that I've come here, I've learned that the servers are snobby, rude people, but the pizza had always been great, so I've put up with their attitudes. But then yesterday I had this crappy pizza that did not seem the same pizza I've learned to love and be proud of. Whenever my relatives would come to Chicago, I'd put up with the long wait times cuz it was worth it all the way. Did something change with the recipes or ingredients? We ordered two large ones and before the cheese used to overpower and melt into the breading of the pan pizza, now it just looked like some toppings on a piece of bread if that makes sense. Anyway, I was disappointed. :L"
"It is with great disappointment that I write a poor review for Pequod's. I just recently visited with great enthusiasm to eat Chicago Deep Dish at this location, but I left very saddened and dissatisfied with my experience. My main complaint is in regards to the timeliness and service. I had just arrived home from a long road trip and was excited to eat at a former favorite Chicago establishment. I visited on a Sunday evening around 7pm. When I arrived, I was greeted and told there would be a half hour wait, which I was ok with, expected, and accepted the pager to await to be seated. About 20 minutes had passed and I noticed a couple of parties that came in after me we're being seated before me. I waited a few more minutes and then approached the hostess to see where I was in line as I was concerned that I may have been overlooked. The hostess was quick to notice that she could not find my pager number on the list, despite having a pager number assigned. She apologized and said she would have me seated next. I was quickly assigned a table and as the other host was directing me to it, she explained that my pager had been called as indicated by the circle marking on the device, but didn't understand why it didn't go off to alert me that my table was ready. Again, the hostess apologized and said it was good that I mentioned something otherwise I could have continued to wait unknowingly as they proceeded to go through the waitlist disregarding my assigned pager number.My server came and took my drink and pizza order shortly after. I ordered a Small Deep Dish pizza and having been here before and aware of the signage regarding cooking and wait times for a deep dish, the wait began. There were a couple of parties across from me who just received their pizzas when I ordered, they ate and left as I waited. I also noted that I was watching the end of the 4th quarter of an NBA Playoff Game and started to watch the following playoff game close to Half Time.Basically I waited quite a while as the tables across from me had new parties seated and waiting whose pizza orders, one of which was a Large Deep Dish came out and was served at the same time as my Small Deep Dish was served. I expressed my concern to my server regarding the wait time, who seemed somewhat agitated that the wait time was an issue to me, explaining the cooking time can take up to 50 minutes. I could have mentioned, that was the only time I was checked on since I had placed my order and I explained that I was not arguing or complaining, just voicing my concerns regarding the obvious situation regarding the timeliness. My server said she would have a manager come by though I did not ask. I was already feeling miserable about the whole experience that honestly I just wanted to pay and leave. (Of note, I noticed the servers were using hand held pads for ordering and charging which I am sure could easily time stamp the events as they were placed.)A manager came over and apologized saying that he understood the situation, explained that it was busy, and  it just happened that all the pizza orders came out at the same time. I was offered 25% off my bill, which I honestly did not care to account for as a new server came by to check on me and who I asked to have my pizza boxed, that I just wanted to close out and pay.As a Chicagoan who has lived here for some time and has had positive memories of this place before, I will no longer return nor recommend this place to residents or visitors alike. Is it a pizza to experience? Possibly, but it is definitely not worth the wait and with so many options for a good Chicago Deep Dish, there are a number of better pizza places in this great city.I understand this review may not be significant to anyone that could go through the thousands of positive reviews, but for anyone that does happen to read through this, I hope you have a better experience if you decide to eat here."
"Food is great, service is completely disgraceful. all the waitresses have attitude problems and the bus boy the the long hair is a douche. 10/10 will be back..."
"Yuk!Service: 1/5The waitress really didn't know the menu, as small as it is. We didn't order jalapeños (which I love, but not on pizza) which ended up on both pizzas. And she charged us twice for one of the pizzas. I'm not into causing a scene so I didn't mention that or the jalapeños. Atmosphere: 5/5Multiple TVs playing sports 24/7, what's not to like?Rathskeller like lighting, fun.Pizza: 1.5/5 (we ordered deep dish and thin crust).Sauce: bitter, tasted like it was cooked and not laddled on fresh. Cheese/toppings: Small gobs of mazzorella on the top, did not cover whole pizza! Light on the meat.Crust: too much flower, cracker like consistency (too much flower, acidic bite), and no char!!! Unforgivable.Seriously, Pizza Hut is better."
"Bathrooms too close to the dining tables and someone destroyed the bathroom when I was there just made for a very unpleasant experience.. pizza was fluffy but very dry tasteless bland crust. Ended up going here with the pizza your downtown. Next time I would pass. Too crowded, too hot, and smells like feces because of the stalls by the tables #yuck"
"Yeah, decided to try and give them another shot today. Figured I'd try carryout this time. Went to see a movie across the street, then afterward walked in, and placed my order, pre-paid and all. They said an hour to an hour and 15 it would be ready. Came back after running misc errands at about an hour and 20 minutes later. Nope...needed 10-15 more in the oven. Took 30. There's just no drive for service here. It's a shame that the food is an easy 5-star rating but the general attitude towards the customer is a 1-2. Do better. Im kind of done with this place. Lou's has exceptionally better service and if Pequods is #1A for pizza Lou's is #1B. Im fine with that.PS: Funny side note: They have the 2014 Zagat survey of their restaurant posted on the wall inside near the carryout pickup...Service is rated a full 8 points lower than food. As if they're proud of it."
It's mostly bread with a thin layer of cheese and barely any sauce. Go to Lou Malnati's instead. I was highly disappointed.
"Had high expectations for this restaurant.Unfortunately was highly disappointed. Between burnt tasting pizza, soggy crust, flavorless product. Hot environment, waitress with attitude who didnt smile I dont know if it's because she was hot and not wanting to be working not my problem. The only thing worthy was the manager on duty who try to make our experience worthwhile. I appreciated his effort but it didn't make up for the whole experience. Won't be back."
"If you prefer more bread over cheese, then you'll probably like it. But if you prefer more cheese, then I recommend Giordano's. I'm from New York, so nothing beats NY pizza. In my opinion, I just thought the pepperoni tasted like Pizza Hut..."
"Very DISAPPOINTED! Had to toss it in the trash. It was NOT deep dish more like bread with marinara, cheese and meatball slices. How whack is that?!? It was a thin layer of cheese on top of thick bread. I don't understand why it takes 45 minutes to make bread dip dish. I'm only giving the two stars for the friendliness of Makayla (Filipino girl) she was very friendly. People like that who are friendly make the establishment wonderful. Parking is so hard to find but there is street. Like I said before good luck."
"The service here was hands down THE worst. Who ever our waiter was, was so rude. He came to the table and irritably told us to move our own plates off the wooden block. Where he then slammed our pizza down and almost burned my hand as I was moving it away. He hurried away and didn't even cut the pizza!!! I've never been to anywhere that served deep dish that didn't cut at least the first slice for you. On top of that he proceeded to cut the pizza for the table behind us..no one came to ask us how anything is or if we needed anything else. It was a horrible experience and I don't want to believe race has anything to do with it but this guy seemed totally racist. Worst experience in a restaurant!"
"I came in here on a Friday night. The place was busy, the rather rude hostess said there's a 40 minute wait, I said OK decided to wait...A few tables opened up no one was being seated there. I asked why, she said they're not seating anyone there. She then said a table opened up but I said I wanted a booth. It wasn't a booth. The hostess said that'll be 30 min more. 5 min go by they start walking towards the upstairs, I didn't want to sit upstairs. No explanation of why the three wide open booth tables were just empty. At that point I was getting restless. As I looked around this turned me off even more (see photos):"
"Disappointed in this place to say the least. I expected more based on the reviews and the pictures. Luckily, we found a better place for Deep Dish Pizza. It took a good 45 minutes to an hour to get our food which isn't a big deal because we had no where to be and we assumed it would take that long anyway. The service was the problem. No refills, no checking on us, messed up the pizza when she cut it and rude attitude. If you're a tourist coming through, you'll either love or hate it. Personally, I enjoy eating more than just dough."
Worst pizza ever!  I don't understand the 5 star reviews at all.  There are so many pizza places around town and especially in Lincoln Park that this one just doesn't compare.
"Went here on a recommendation. It's just burnt over-hyped pizza. Nothing tasty about it and honestly one of the worst pizzas ever. They boast they are Chicago's number 1 pizza place. If thats the case Chicago pizza has gone down hill since I moved away. This place is junk. I feel like people believe its hype. I am sure you could find better pizza elsewhere. In fact, we had to and threw away all of our gross burnt pizza. My cousins who are also from Chicago and moved to California came back for a visit and went here on a recommendation. They said the same thing. Hopefully people get better taste.Side note:I would rather eat a frozen home run inn pizza"
Not a fan of blackened burnt cheese. When we asked for a replacement pie we were told that's their signature. I asked blackened cheese? She said yes. So there ya go. I get maybe a nice tan but blackened? Anyway most of it was thrown away.
"This is the most over-rated pizza place in Chicago. Listen, the pizza is not terrible, but it's sub-par. I'm certainly not going to wait over an hour for burnt cheese and pizza that taste slightly better than a pan pizza from Pizza Hut."
"I feel like I need to give Pequod's another chance because so many people have said good things. My first try though wasn't that great. I got a thin crust delivered, so that could be why the crust wasn't crisp. The tomato sauce didn't have flavor and I thought the crust was too thick for a think crust. The bread was a little dense too. I didn't eat much of that. I will give it another try and go for the deep dish next time."
"Was an unfortunate let down.  After multiple, glowing reviews I was excited to enjoy this apparent pizza institution.  To the point, ordered lunch size 7"" pie with sausage and mushrooms.   After first bite, added the salt and pepper.  Once halfway through, likened the experience to a ""biscuit pizza"".  I don't get it.  Dough was dry, not enough cheese, had to create a good bite rather than the meal supply plenty of flavor.   Server was polite.  Counts for one of the above stars.   Next trip back, not likely to hit this place again on the way to O'Hare."
I totally don't get the enthusiasm for this place. Give me Due's (downtown) with sausage and pepperoni over Pequod's version any time.
"The sauce was acidic and the dough was about what I could make and I don't bake. It wasn't bad, but I don't understand the line out the door that showed up five minutes after we did."
"DO NOT COME HERE. Yelp usually doesn't let me down, so I'm really sad that it has this time. These reviews are completely inaccurate. We waited 45 minutes just to be seated and another hour for our deep dish pizza to come out. I had Giordano's last time I came to Chicago and wanted to share this amazing experience with my boyfriend. Instead we were presented with a thin burnt crust on our deep dish and a ridiculously long wait. Was not worth it at all."
I'm only giving two stars for the staff.  I'm stunned people so young can handle so much chaos.  Other then that the sausage and pepperoni used was good but the rest of the pizza is basically an hour and a half for Pizza Hut. Is this the best Chicago has to offer?  Sad.
Ridiculously long wait. I was told it would be an hour wait and after 2.5 hours I still wasn't seated. Chicago has plenty of pizza places that make this a waste of your time.
"I have no idea why this place is always crowded and there is frequently a line to get in.  It's crowded, and noisy, and questionably clean.   The pizza's OK, but there is much better pizza in Chicago at Giordano's or Lou Malnati's.   Nicer places too."
"I recently had dinner here with a group of 10 people, ages ranging from mid-30s to late 40s.  We had attended the Cubs game earlier in the day and decided to have pizza for dinner.  I have been to this pizzeria previously.  The pizza is always outstanding, but the service is average at best.  However, several individuals in the group were visiting from out-of-town and wanted to have dinner at Pequod's.  The service our group experienced was horrible.  We waited about an hour for our table, which wasn't unusual for a Saturday night.  We were seated and our waitress asked to take our drink orders.  For our group of 10, we ordered two pitchers of beer.  The waitress quickly informed us that based on instructions from the manager, we were ""one and done"" so we could at most order one pitcher of beer.  We were shocked by her response and asked her to explain.  She was incredibly rude and indicated that her manager concluded that we had attended the Cubs game and appeared to have consumed too much alcohol; therefore, the pizzeria made the decision to limit our group to one drink per person.  We asked to talk to someone else.  A second employee of the restaurant approached our table, looked at one of the members of our group, and stated ""he entered the pizzeria and was slurring and had glassy eyes"", so our alcohol consumption was being limited.  This employee's assessment was false.  The individual in our group who was being accused of this behavior asked clarifying questions, and the employee, appearing embarrassed, left to find the manager.  The manager came to our table and explained that he had asked his employees to monitor our group and determine if we were fit to have more than one drink.  He subsequently apologized and acknowledged that his staff had clearly misunderstood his instructions.  While I appreciate the manager's response, his staff's behavior to our group was offensive.  While our pizza was very good, I will not return to this restaurant.  There are too many good pizzerias in Chicago that treat their customers with respect. Absent the good food, I would have assigned a rating of one star instead of two."
"Dont understand what all the hype is about. Waited over an hour for a table. They had one poor girl working the host stand, not enough. When we finally got sat our table was in the middle of a loud room on the second floor with uncomfortable chairs. The salad came out before the beer without utensils. The pizza took ages. The crust was burnt, or as they say ""caramelized,"" but the rest of the pizza was decent. Our server seemed too busy to take care of us. Of all the places to get deep dish in Chicago wont be returning to this one."
I have ordered pick up twice from this restaurant. Both times the pizza is cold and the pick-up time was 1.5 hours. It seems they need help determining pick-up time vs. serving fresh food. I will not be back.
"Disappointing Pequod's experience on Super Bowl Sunday.  My friend had a party, and ordered (through Door Dash) at noon for a 6:30pm delivery.  Now, I get that's it the Super Bowl, so they were likely busy, but they should've been prepared.  And that's why my friend ordered at noon.The door dash driver was there on time, and kept sending my friend updates that he was just sitting there waiting for them to give him the pizzas to deliver.  He finally arrived an hour after we were supposed to originally get them. Getting late pizzas wouldn't have been such an issue, but the order was completely wrong.  One was supposed to be a thin-crust half-Hawaiian, half-cheese, but instead it was cheese and pineapple on one side and cheese and ham on the other.  The deep-dish was supposed to be half sausage and half pepperoni, but the pizza instead had no meat and had green peppers on the whole thing.  The pizza tasted okay, not great, but the garlic bread we got wasn't good, either.Again, I get Super Bowl Sunday is a big day for pizza places, but this should not have been a surprise to them  Getting the pizza late AND having the order be completely wrong, especially for the price paid, is extremely disappointing.  I'm sure the experience in the restaurant is much different/better, but this was not a good experience."
"OK. OK. So my first review was a bit grumpy. But C'mon, a 3 hour rolling delay for a table?For fathers day my very lovely family ordered a carry-out pizza from the Morton Grove location and brought it home.And it was (drumroll please)...fine. It was better than Giordano's or Uno or Gino's. But not better than Pizzano's or Lou Malnati's. Not enough cheese despite the wonderful burnt cheese around the edges, the crust was thick and really just bread, the sauce was OK. I'm glad I tried it."
"We checked out this Chicago pizza place on our way home from road tripping to the west. We picked it because it had great reviews on none other then YELP.COM. my husband and I have been to Chicago a few other times ( mostly just flying into and out of O'HARE) so we have had other deep dish/ pan style pizza. Unfortunately this pizza was just ENNNN, nothing too special but it wasn't bad. The edges were crispy and blackened, melted cheese and slightly greasy pepperoni, the good kinda. Other pizzerias defiantly have better style pizza with lots of layers of cheese and mountains of toppings more like a pizza cake. Pequod's was 90% dough, layer of sauce and the traditional cheese and pep. Also it roughly took about 40 mins for the pizza to be fully completed, ( which was a really long time for to-go order placed on a Tuesday at roughly 2 pm --- I cant image how long you would have to wait if your going/ ordering at a busy time ) which is kinda of a long wait for 1 medium cheese and pep pie... I don't think we would come here again because basically it was just okay, nothing special, just an average pizza & an atrocious wait time.."
"Decent enough pizza, started off as a good experience but the night was eventually ruined by multiple rude staff members. I'm not the type to write reviews but was a little taken aback by this experience, do yourself a favor and get it to go."
"I don't know what it was but something about this place really fell flat for me.Maybe it was the fact that my coworkers talked it up so much? I don't know, but whatever the case, it just didn't live up to the expectations I had.I went on a Saturday night (it was very busy, so much that I could barely hear my friend while we waited to be seated) and found that the crowd consisted of your standard Depaul area crowd. The wait was much longer than anticipated (over an hour!) and when we finally were seated, service was a bit lackluster.We ordered a cheese pizza which boasted a caramelized crust, but when it arrived it just looked burnt. The taste wasn't that special either and I found myself wishing for some Giordano's. Sadly, I don't think this place is for me."
"Came here as the last spot during our weekend in Chicago. Rating is for the attitude from the host when we got there. We came at 3 pm on a random Tuesday with all our bags, clearly tourists, and were greeted with hostility because someone in our party was wearing a Yankees hat..completely unnecessary. I understand it's a sports bar with pride, but we didn't come during a big game, or during any game. There were maybe 6 other parties in the restaurant -- it was pretty obvious we were here as tourists just expecting genuine Chicago-style pizza. Instead, we got a load of BS and yet were still seated? Next time just don't bother seating us if you care about pride more than hospitality. Not worth it for me to even give a review on the food."
We were told there was a wait and to go next door. We were given a pager n told it would be 45 min wait. After 5 min the pager goes off and we are seated. I Was in a car accident n taking the stairs slowly. The manager assumed i was drunk n wouldn't let any of us drink. Even though the place was filled with drunks and I had not been drinking. The manager was very rude raising his voice in front of other customers. I was so emberassed. This was my favorite pizza place
"I have heard so many good things about Pequod's pizza from all of my friends, but I just don't think it's that good. I've had it 3 times now, and have never really enjoyed it. I usually don't write yelp reviews, but I felt it was necessary for this pizza. I ordered a half sausage with cheese and half spinach and mushroom with cheese deep dish pizza. If you like a deep dish pizza with 95 bread and no cheese or toppings, then this is where you want to order from. I don't know if they decide to not try on takeout orders, that's what I've heard, but this pizza was so bad, I needed to write a review. I felt ripped off. Please observe picture. I prefer uno's, due's, lou's, giordano's, and even dominos to pequods. Would probably never order myself again, but if my friends want to order pequods, I hope it will be better than this past pizza."
"I am probably saying something that is considered sacrilegious in Chicago, but, in our household's opinion, Pequod's pizza is totally overrated. Aside from having to wait on hold for more than 15 minutes to try to get it ordered for delivery, the pizza we picked up had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The Italian sausage tasted like unseasoned ground beef and the tomato sauce had no flavor. Sorry for this, but this may the first pizza we have not finished and didn't want to save for leftovers."
"This place is overrated. The pizza wasn't the best, I've had better. But what was very disappointing was the terrible service we got from our server. She was not friendly at all and kept giving us an attitude for no reason. And the wait was extremely long."
"Went to this place after Cubs game- here's my first impression as I walked in- DIRTY! Staff looked exhausted although it was end of night. Pizza wait was 40 minutes although person at bar said he had been waiting over an hour... not that many people in restaurant, maybe heavy carry out causing wait time? I had a Italian sausage, with sweet peppers. Ok this may possibly have been the worst Italian sausage I've ever had- it resembled beef jerky- the peppers, nearly raw- warmed up is how I would describe- bread was way to big not a sausage roll- friend had meatball sandwich, as I write this it's 7:30 am 8.5 hours later and he's puking- the meatball sandwich was ridiculous- it looked like they started making a pizza then realized it was a sandwich? I know this is a pizza place first but come on if you mess up a simple sandwich how good can the pizza be? I mean seriously. My guess this place is frequented by people right out of college that were eating Dominos pizza for the past 5 years in college. The older group probably ate there years ago wandered in and realized the pizza wasn't as good as they thought. My guess is that if any of you 4 star reviewers took a tour of that kitchen you'd drive straight to Cosco to buy a pallet of toilet paper cause you'll surely need it.. I agree that Lou's is way ahead of this place-oven grinder another good place as I remember although haven't been there in a while, might feel the same way- I like well lit restaurants that don't have a wad of gum sitting on bar when I sit down. Maybe I hit this place on a bad night- I doubt it though... The bartender was very nice, she gladly took our money with a big smile-"
I had their lunch special once and it was pretty decent. A pizza joint has to be more than pretty decent in Chicago to go back for a second time.
Called in for order..only gave my first name.. Kim.. it says Kim Nguyen on receipt. *kinda of racist..* came home and the pizza was not what I ordered. Called in to tell them and the host argued that my caller ID is showing Kim Nguyen.. the phone I'm using is not even the phone I used to call in for the order. This is crazy.... let's see if they actually gave me my refund.
"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. My family and I came to the restaurant back in July because a lot of people we spoke to recommended Pequods over Giordano's and Lou Malnati's, let's just say they couldn't be more wrong. The experience from start to finish was one of the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. We waited over 3 hours for a table of 10. At first I didn't mind the wait because we were a large party but by the time it was 12am and we were still waiting it was kind of insane. When they finally called our table we were seated upstairs and while walking upstairs we noticed the entire restaurant was empty. I think maybe one or two parties were left but there were so many tables available i couldn't believe they took so long to seat us. By the time they seated us we put in our order right away and then waited another hour for the pizza, for 4 pies of pizza! At that point we had been waiting for 4 hours, 3 hours to sit then another hour to eat. It was 1230am and I decided to ask one of the waitresses why the pizza was taking so long, she looked up at me and said ""don't you see I'm folding boxes, I'm busy, I can't help you."" I understand she wasn't our waitress but it wouldn't have been so hard to say ""sorry if you give me one second I'll grab your server and she can help you."" Anyways, to top it all off, when our pizza finally did come it was the most mediocre of pizzas I've ever had. There was no cheese, the entire pizza was just dough, I wouldn't call it a deep dish or actually a pizza really.I wouldn't waste time coming to any of their locations. Lou Malnatis and Giordanos were far better in my opinion and there's no sassy waitress folding boxes there."
"Not a fan. I like deep dish pizza, just not Pequod's crust. It is a biscuit like dough and very dry and crumbly in my opinion. Caramelized cheese was nice but not enough to compensate."
"We came here on recommendation from friends that this was the best deep dish in the city. Better than Lou Malnati's or Giordano's. We ordered a pizza to go because the wait was over an hour and it's too crowded to wait inside and not a great waiting space. I was sorely disappointed by the deep dish and it was the worst deep dish I have had. The crust was really dry and there was a few dollops of cheese but mostly dry bread with sauce. I'm not sure if it was an off night since it seems like most people seem to like it, but definitely not what I expected. I would like to try it again to see if it was just a bad pie, but don't want to end up like last time. I will definitely update my review next time I try. I prefer Lou's and Giordano's at this point."
"Went here for Lunch. I was very excited to try the deep dish here as I had heard it was the best in Chicago. I've always been a Gino's East fan myself. Ordered ahead and used the text service to expedite our meal. The pizza came out within the time they said, however it was soggy and watery. The sauce was not seasoned at all and the pizza at all was flavorless. However, the one fantastic part of the pizza was the caramelized cheese crust which was delicious. Rest of the pizza was awful. Thankfully, the server spoke to the manager and they took the pizza off our bill. Unfortunately, both me and my companion got food poisoning from the single slices we ate. I will try Pequods again as I'm hoping it was just our bad luck that our pizza was terrible."
For 15 years I have gotten great takeout pizza from Pequods. Last night my wife and I chose to actually eat in at the restaurant. It was not at all crowded (that is unusual) but a large sign at the greeter's table warned of a 40 minute wait (at least) if you dared order pizza -deep dish or thin crust.  The greeter did say we could get slices in ten minutes. Slices came in about 20 minutes burned up and singed. 1/2 order of spaghetti ordered with cheese came quickly with a mountain of cheese burying a tiny bit of spaghetti and a small single meatball (for $2.95 additional). Unrecognizable as a small spaghetti dinner. One of the worst  restaurant meals I've  ever had!We'll go back to ordering take out pizza from Pequods.
"I went on Sunday with some friends and the waiting was wait too long. We asked our pan pizza to go because we though that it would take less time that if we wait for a table at the restaurant. But it wasn't like that. They told us that we had to wait for 1:15 hours, and we were waiting there for 2 hours. It was really frustrating because they were telling us that they were checking our order, but they were not doing it. Finally, one of the workers appeared 45 minutes later than our original waiting time with our order and other 10 more orders. Our biggest surprise was that when we arrived home 5 minutes later and we ate the pizza it was not that good like if you eat it in the restaurant. The crust wasn't crunchy like it should be, and the pizza was kind of cold. We use to go to this restaurant a lot to eat the best pan pizza in Chicago, but now I don't know if we will come back."
"Placed order at 2:45pm for a 5pm delivery. They lost the order. New delivery time was by 6pm. Called at 6:15 to check in. The pizza had ""just come out of the oven"". The pizza just got here at 7:39pm.LITERALLY 2 HOURS AND 39 MINUTES AFTER STATED DELIVERY TIME.By far the worst pizza delivery experience of my life. Very very disappointed by Pequods. Will never order takeout from them again."
"Man, got some soggy deep dish tonight. Bottom was literally soaking wet. I had to throw the pizza in my oven for 30 minutes. Gross"
"hmmm... i don't know.  either we went on an off night, or this place is supremely hyped up.  i honestly don't know if we went on an off night, because people were waiting outside to be seated.  long story short, it took over an hour to get our pizza, and once the pizza arrived, the bottom was burnt and there was not enough cheese. maybe i'm holding this place to such a high standard, but i should right??? Michelin recommend this place, and you know if they recommend it... it has to be good. the crust and bread holding the pizza was just too thick and the sauce was kinda lacking.  the price for a small pizza is roughly 12 bucks, and toppings are an extra 2 bucks.   not to mention, parking is almost impossible to find on the streets, so you'll have to park across the street at he movie theater lot for 10 bucks. =/ i was going in with high hopes, but this place fell short of them."
This place is full of it.  They screwed me over with my take out order.  Lied and said they would make it right with a credit.  When I  called to redeem  the credit didn't exist.  I will never do business with them again.  I don't pay the get screwed.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!
"When I called ahead I was told that they would not put the pizza in until we were here. I thought, wow they must deal with a lot of sketchy people. Then when we got here they told us that the pizza won't be started until we were seated. It took 15 minutes for them to seat us. They put us upstairs where they have one waitress for 20 tables. They let us know that the pizza would be 40 minutes. We have been here an hour. Our waitress came to the table and apologized that they ""lost"" our order and that it will be an additional 20 minutes. The waitress just came to ask if we wanted to order additional food! Um, no, we'd not like to spend more money here! We'd like what we called ahead for."
"I don't get the hype....I found Pequod's totally overrated. Full disclosure: not a hater of deep dish, but strongly prefer thin crust. Regardless, I did not find the pizza that tasty. Didn't like the biscuity quality to the crust and didn't think the sauce, pepperoni or sausage was that tasty. I'm not going to advertise for other pizza joints in this review, but there is much better pizza to be had in Chicago. I did like the carmelized cheese on the crust, but this barely tasted like pizza to me, it was like some generic Italian-ish pot pie w/out enough garlic/herbs/flavor. All it was was filling. I tried it, it did nothing to make deep dish more appealing to me."
"The atmosphere was nice and so were the employees, however the thin crust pizza slices I ordered were over priced for what I received. This pizza does not adhere to the standards I hold Chicago pizza to. If you are high as a kite and need some warm food in your belly before you sack out then this joint could be for you. The staff, atmosphere and late night hour is what this place has going for it but you want to go here for a slice of pizza(it's in the name) for a comparable price. I would not recommend to others."
"It's a shame what a little bit of fame and popularity can do to a place. Have been going to Pequod's for years because they have the absolutely best pizza.  In the past, execution and customer service has been good. (See my review from 4 years ago...).  Unfortunately, the last 3 times I have been to Pequod's my order has been totally screwed up - and the worst part, THEY DON'T CARE.  Lack of any concern for customer experience and never expressing any sincere apology from the invisible management has finally driven me (party of 9) away for good.   They have made it abundantly clear they have enough business and don't need mine.  There are other decent pizza places who will APPRECIATE my business in the future."
"I don't understand the hype of this place. Super small, so it was obviously over crowded. The staff all seemed to be either stoned or off of some other stuff I don't even know of.And honestly, the pizza wasn't even THAT good.Save yourself the experience, and don't go here."
"Food was okay, nothing to go crazy about.. but the service was terrible. Won't make it a point to come back."
"Not as good as the hype! It's OK, but I'm not a big fan of golf ball size sausage and very little sauce. I will stay with Nancy's deep dish  or Aurelio's thin crust any day !"
"A huge disappointment. There was wait which I don't understand why when majority of the second floor was empty; we were seated upstairs. What is up with people and deep dishes? I was excited to travel to Chicago to finally try the famous deep dish pizza and that was a huge mistake; the grumpy guy that sat across me couldn't agree any less. We had the small pan pizza with onion, pepper, mushroom, basil, pineapple and some other greens. It wasn't bad looking but the taste...he finished his slice and I couldn't even stuff another bite. I think I ate a total of 2.5 bites of my slice and doggie bagged the rest for my mommie. Mom didn't like it either. We also ordered the appetizer combo that came with mozzarella sticks, zucchini slices, jalapeño poppers, and breaded mushrooms. I was super excited for the mozzarella sticks because I can't remember how old I was when I had it; probably in high school. I can't say it fulfilled my craving for mozzarella sticks but it was definitely one of the better appetizers. Everything else was being ingested out of hunger. We also ordered the garlic bread and wow were we upset. It wasn't garlicy or buttery. Hmm. This is a tough review. I feel like it's suppose to be good but I had such a bad experience with the food."
"This was the least flavorful ""deep dish"" pizza I've ever experienced. The deep dish was more ""pan pizza"" and less deep dish. The sauce was in dire need of salt, the crust was soggy and the meat lacked any flavor at all. Where was the cheese? Several people recommended this restaurant over my favorite Giodarnos and over Lou Malnatis, but I'm convinced they lacked tastebuds. The only positive was our waitress Tessa, who was polite and attentive. I was otherwise, beyond disappointed."
"Came here on the suggestion of different locals. Left supremely disappointed. The pizza was not deep dish, which is what we expressed that we wanted when Pequads was suggested. What we got was a very thick pan pizza with little to no cheese, bland sauce, and unappealing toppings. It was really unfortunate, as we picked this place over Lou Malnati's. Won't make that mistake again."
"This place has great pizza but the service tonight ON MY BIRTHDAY was terrible! I ordered a pizza at 8:15pm. Now it's 10:17 I just cancelled the order because it never came. Some idiot lost my order. They took half off my bill and promised my order would be ready in 15min at 9:50pm. 25min later my food wasn't ready, so I cancelled my order. I hate incompetence. I will never eat here again. I'd rather spin month at a place that might not taste as good but have enough good sense, not to lose my order. What's worse is u can believe I drove damn near an hour to get it. Never again. And I'll be sure to tell/talk anybody I know out of coming here. Here's a tip: Get some better business Practices!!! Thanks!!!"
"Before anyone gets outraged for the 1 star rating, this review is only for their veggie pizza. I got a pan pizza while my friend got the thin crust one and both of them were so disappointing, the thin crust slightly less so. It looked like raw unseasoned veggies were just added on top of a cheese pizza. The pizza sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce. The only thing good about the pan pizza was the crust. Rightly done, I am sure this pizza could have been amazing. It took us 30 mins to get a table and additional 30 minutes before the pizza was brought out. So not worth the time or money if you are a vegetarian."
"I came here on a recommendation from a friend who lived in Chicago.  I got on the ""preferred seating"" list for 7 p.m. and we got here early.  Upon arrival we were told that it would be a wait of 45 minutes to an hour.....even though we got on their ""preferred seating"" list for 7.  What kind of restaurant makes you wait an extra hour even though you have a reservation?I guess business here is so good you can lie and give customers the shaft and not have to worry about it."
"After a few recommendations from locals, we decided to visit and taste for ourselves. We arrived and waited for about 10 minutes before we even got asked about what we would like for drinks. In discussions with the server, she advised that the deep dish takes about 40min to bake. So, we opted to get slices instead as we had a plane to catch. Well, 40 minutes later 2 of us got slices that were warm, not hot, warm. Our friend ended up getting a personal thin crust which is not what he ordered. The pizza was not good for any of us. We were absolutely disappointed with the service and quality of food. Maybe on a return trip, we'll try again and get better service and food."
"On my flight over to Chicago I watched an episode of ""Delicious Destinations"" which was all about places to eat while in the City in which they recommended this place.  I was overly disappointed when coming here.  Service and everything was fine, but the sauce on the pizza was filled with entirely too many seasonings.  It reminded me of a marinara sauce made by someone who doesn't know what they are doing, I really didn't like it.Also- they are known here for this ""signature"" burnt cheese crust.  I can't understand for the life of me what makes it that special.  It tastes exactly like you would imagine, like burnt cheese.  I wouldn't waste my time coming here if you are visiting- stick with Lou Malnatis."
"We ordered a pizza an hour before close, paid for it upfront, walked up 20 minutes before close to pick it up which is when we were told to come get it and all the employees looked at us, and ducked behind the bar. We waited outside knocking to get our pizza that was paid for, never got it, and out $30."
"While the pizza is amazing, the customer service is less than stellar (at least for delivery).  I've frequented Pequods for many years, several times a month.  I finally decided to get it delivered.  I noticed that I was less than a block from the cusp of their delivery zone and almost didn't call until I saw that they would be willing to make ""reasonable accommodations.""   I was told that it was way too far north (even though they deliver for several more miles south) (about 2.5 miles).  In fact, they tried arguing with me as to where I actually lived, stating that it was far too many miles north of a particular street (that I actually live south of!)Am I bitter?  Sure.  But when they offer ""reasonable accommodations,"" and then argue about the location of my address.... hmm.  no pizza is worth that treatment."
"I have definitely had better service from here before and I was k with the crappy service, til I got home to eat our carry out pizza. We got there at 4:30 pm, at this time we were advised there was a 45 minute wait, so we went to the ""waiting tank"". Now its 5:45pm and we still have not been seated, I went to ask how long did we still have to wait for a table, the hostess gave me attitude as if ""how dare I asked such question"" and said we still had 7 people ahead of us.  Couldn't wait for that, had 7pm tickets for the movies and its almost 6pm, I still had another hour for a table and 30 minutes for the pizza... lol. I just placed an order for a carry out to have ready when we left the movie theater.. 20 minutes later, once I finished my drink, went to the same girl and asked to change the time for pick up, wanted to assure my pizza wasn't just sitting there over cooking if it was done earlier than expected. She told me it was impossible to change the time, she said "" the kitchen is extremely backed up, most likely it won't be ready by 9 regardless"". We get there at 9:30, which was the time I asked them to change the pick up time to, didn't check the pizza, was too excited to eat it since I had been craving it for months. when I get home, its an over cooked and cold pizza that I found. I couldn't even finish one slice. Hostess should try to pay more attention to requests, it would make the 3 hour wait more bearable."
"Don't care for the wait or the attitude. Pizza is meh. Honestly, the alternatives you have before you when you are rejected by them and often much better."
"Wouldn't know how the pizza is because the person taking delivery orders was so rude I decided not to go ahead with the order. Seems like they don't need my business, so I'll take it elsewhere. Update: my husband did order the pizza one night and the crust came completely burned and the pizza just wasn't good (although I liked their pepperoni). I can't believe this place is to popular"
"Pizza was just ok.  Service was not good.  Slow and no attention to detail.  Then my wife told me the woman's restroom was dirty.  We had 3 places our friends told us to go for pizza, next time we will try one of the others."
"I used to love this place in college. I went back tonight and had an awful experience. The hostess with the brown hair, glasses, and winged eyeliner was rude and a smart ass. If I call and make a reservation and you call it a reservation on the phone w/o any further information about said reservation, I'm going to assume I'll be seated within half an hour. An hour later we were seated. Reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't eat until 9:30. The pizza was soggy. I could tell it was soggy coming out but the guy who gave me a slice insisted it wasn't. The pizza was okay but the service was horrible. JUST DO CARRY OUT!"
Overrated. Way too doughy. The ratio of sauce to bread is way too little. Lou malanatis all day
"Service was poor. One pizza came out cold and watery. Piss poor beer. They took the pan with the cold pizza, and put it in their oven a bit longe. There was a half eaten slice of pizza in the pan."
"Came so highly recommended to us as the best deep dish in Chicago. Nope, not even close. We had olive and mushroom, the toppings weren't even cooked. The sauce was bland and the salad was hohum. We got seated quick and the service was good but the star of the show wasn't really a star."
"Ordered delivery on a Friday. Never making the mistake of ordering here again and will take every opportunity to dissuade others. Wrote a much longer review but deleted, because why spend the time?Terrible pizza (yet always seem to order once a year thinking it'll get better). Rude and unprofessional customer service. Waited over two hours for delivery (was quoted 1:30 when ordered, again when I called to get an eta after 1:30, and can be seen clearly on my receipt). The manager(?) was incredibly rude and called me a liar about the quoted time (""I doubt you were told 1:30 - we train our girls to say 1:30-2 hours). Looks like some retraining is required starting with you sir. Life is too short to deal with people like this. Point is...Many pizza joints that are much better and treat their customers with respect. Why bother with this bready, bland and sad pizza from an establishment that apparently doesn't value their customers? Easy decision and easy to remedy this situation before insulting a paying customer as well as your female employees."
"Having heard so many praises for Pequod's, I was super excited when I found out we were going to get a delivery of their pizzas for a party on a Friday night.We ordered the pizza on the Wednesday to be delivered on Friday at 7:30pm, the order was confirmed and my friend's credit card was charged. My friend called the next day to amend the order, still confirming the order to be delivered for Friday at 7:30pm. My friend called again on Friday afternoon to confirm the order to be delivered for the previously agreed time, and it was once again confirmed.Friday comes around and we made a little appetizer to be enjoyed while waiting for the pizzas.7:30pm comes around and no pizza.7:45pm, no pizza.8:00pm, still no pizza.We call Pequod's to see how much longer until we were to expect our pizzas. The person on the phone said the ordered was placed, but the kitchen staff didn't want to make the order, so they tossed it out. He said they were going to make it now though. He apologised and gave us a $30 credit to be used on our next order. The pizzas finally came at 9:30pm, 2 hours after the thrice confirmed time and didn't look very good and was super doughy, so I didn't quite like it. I guess the kitchen staff really didn't want to make this order.I'm extremely disappointed with this encounter with Pequod's. What is management doing to the kitchen staff to make them choose to ignore an order simply because they did not want go make it? Or was it just an excuse for them forgetting to put in our order all together? Please fix how you operate your business!"
"Requires a 24 hour advance reservation. At 5:00pm we were told 4 1/2 hour wait unless you call 24 hours in advance for ""priority"" seating, and then it is an hour wait.    This is my second time trying to eat Pequod's in a week. Will have to wait another year before we came back to town."
"Doooooowngrade for delivery - they don't use third parties so you have to call. Understandably it's busy but I got through. Placed an order at 5:30pm. Hour and a half she says. We live 10 minutes away but with my bronchitis and the rain storm figured delivery was the way to go.Got the pizza at 8:30 (double the estimate). Noticed on the receipt the order wasn't put in until 6pm. Received it medium warm and the onion rings were cold - and they forgot the ranch .... straight to garbage and they are my favorite onion rings in Chicago. At least they got the pizza toppings right...?I know you're popular and busy, Pequod's. But at this point you should have a system in place for deliveries. Get it together, P."
Dont get the personal pepperoni pizza. It's very impersonal. Very much lacking in cheese and flavor. Deep dish more like fake dish. Good service though.
"Unsure what the hype was about this place. The decor was old smelled kinda raunchy inside? They seated us upstairs in this booth, was about to fall apart. The fan above the table looked like it had not been dusted in years, swallow as the blinds on the window we were sitting by. The waitress was rude and obnoxious, one of them trying to be funny and cute - but she was neither. We ordered drinks (watered down alcohol) got some apps they were good but the smaller had like 3 of each thing, huge plate but minimal food. Then we ordered pizza - the most foul pizza I've ever eaten. The sauce tasted watered down - zero flavor and the pizza dough was not good - I asked if the pizza is always this burnt, she replied no they must've left it in to long - sorry were busy??? Really ? Then the bill came and was way over priced ! Over all if you want something in the upside - the food runner was the most pleasant person in the place and was the only one who was apologetic !Save your time go someplace else who will appreciate you spending about $200.00."
"Pequods does not have gluten free pizza which I need since I'm a celiac, but my husband wanted to try their pizza so I went with him. He got a deep dish pizza, wine and a salad. There was a 45 minute wait, so I went to grab a gluten free pizza down the street. His pizza arrived at the bar, so I sat down and was eating my pizza as well. The manager came over and told me I couldn't eat my pizza. He also said he needed to ask us to leave. I totally understand there is rules about outside food, so I put the pizza box in my oversized purse, and stopped eating. I thought since the pizza wasn't out that it would be ok. We continued to sit at the bar while my husband (a paying customer) was enjoying his food. The bartender who was very nice came over and asked if my husband needed his food boxed implying we need to go. My husband said he was not finished, and asked if we had to leave. The manager came back over, and aggressively told us he had said we need to leave. I offered to the manager to wait outside with my purse (which had the pizza box in it) while my husband finished. The manager was not having it. I could understand if we were not complying or making a scene, but the manager was totally out of line. My husband barely drank his wine, and had not yet touched his salad. He said he wasn't going to pay for the food if he can't even eat it. The manager said we still had to pay, but couldn't finish. My husband said he wouldn't pay if he can't eat, so the manager took his glass, forks, etc. and threw it all on top of the pizza and told us to leave. This was a terrible example of customer service! I will never go back. This guy seriously had a personal problem, and very unhappy in his own life. I can't believe someone would treat customers like that! Not only did he lose our sale, but we would have came back because my husband actually liked the pizza."
"I'll stick to Giordano's, if I feel like something different Lou Malnati's. The crust was too hard and I didn't care for the sauce."
If you want cheese on cardboard then this is the place to come to. I think many of the good reviews come from the fact that it is open late and we all know that after alcohol just about anything is good. The crust was super dry and was covered with a thin layer of cheese. The waitress seemed quite disinterested in customer service. I would recommend any of the other local chains over this place.
"If I could give zero stars I would. Awful delivery experience. After waiting 2 hours for the pizza, it was wrong. When I called I was told they would send out another pizza but that I'd have to wait another 2 hours despite this being a restaurant mistake! I asked to speak to the manager and was rudely placed on hold for 10+ minutes. The manager lied to me saying she would get out the corrected pizza to me in an hour .... it has been another 2 hours and still NO pizza!!! To say they're lack in customer service, lack in management, and overall rudeness leaves a lot to be desired!!! I would expect at the very least for the restaurant to offer me a gift card for my inconvenience! I would highly recommend getting your pizza elsewhere!"
Yeh ..... I don't get it.  These are so many great reviews on this place. We tried what would be proclaimed to be the best pizza in the universe and it felt very short. The crust was mediocre at best the cheese had no flavor and the marinara sauce very bland. I was with a party of five... We ate it but we didn't feel like it was that great. Sorry!
"I hate to give this place a one star , specially because I love the pizza here . But every time I come here i could never sit in a booth ! I get it it's always busy but today is a Monday ... maybe 5 tables were being used I requested a booth that was available and I was told no ! So I don't understand why not if there's was no wait behind me ? They just wanted to sit me in a tiny table in the middle mind you I just had knee surgery that does not allow me to sit in high chairs . But when I requested a booth I could t even explain that to the girl because  she didn't even let me finish telling her why I was requesting a booth . Sadly I had to just walk out because I couldn't get a booth and I couldn't sit in a highchair ."
"I'm torn. Pequod's is a great pizza, however my latest experience has me thinking I won't be ordering there anytime soon. We called in a delivery order at 5:30pm and did not get our pizza until 9:15pm. I couldn't believe it. When I called to check on the status at 8pm, the kitchen had not even gotten the order. The woman on the phone intimated that there was nothing she could do, and snidely asked if I wanted to talk to the manager. I spoke with him and he assured me he'd put the order in and have it sent out first thing. That took another 1:15 hours (I live 0.8mi from the restaurant). It's really unfortunate because it's good pizza, but just buyer-beware on deliveries... you may wait a long time. Pizza isn't worth a ~4 hour wait."
"I had the pan pepperoni.The pizza breaks down like this: 90% cardboard flavored crust, 4% mediocre sauce, 5% ashes of what was formerly cheese 1% razor thin pepperoni.This how a pizza would be made if the only consideration was maximizing the profit, as the cheapest ingredients dominate way beyond what is palatable; then handed off to an incompetent cook staff to burn any flavor right out of the pie.Will not be returning."
This place is ridiculous. DO NOT GO HERE. We put a reservation in and they said we s STILL have to wait for over an hour. Plus the PIZZA is terrible.
"Pequod's has really gone downhill in recent years. The wait times are the usual for deep dish pizza (~40-60 mins) but then you often wait longer because of the hype. However, the last time I went my pizza wasn't cooked in the middle (cold, still-raw dough), even after all that time. I feel like a few years ago (like 2012-14ish) the crust was less bread-y, and had more flavor. The last couple times I've gone, I've been disappointed in both the food and the service. The servers are unsmiling and rushed. It was my go-to place to take visiting tourists, but now I'll take them up to Burt's instead."
"The staff was wonderful and amicable, but the pizza was not as tasty and delectable as expected for a highly reviewed Chicago Deep Dish Pizza eatery.  I must say, I was highly disappointed as this restaurant has received high accolades for the taste of the pizza, and I didn't experience that wonderful taste as mentioned in the reviews.  The dough had no flavor, and it was just toppings on a pizza nothing fantastic.  Papa Johns and MOD pizza were better tasting.  The staff again was wonderful they just need to improve on the pizza."
Diner in once before and thought it wasn't up to snuff relative to the other deep dish offerings in the area.  Got delivery tonight and it was nonsense.  It was like a focaccia bread with absolutely minimal toppings.  Multiple slices had (barely) 1 of the 2 toppings we ordered.  This was an embarrassment.  Complete joke.  Never again.  Only plus was fast delivery.  Try Chicago's Pizza or Art of Pizza nearby.
"An embarrassing example of Chicago deep dish pizza. Check out the picture I posted that shows large hunk of bread with a tiny layer of cheese on top. A lot of the pictures look great with that burnt crust and all. But what you are not seeing is that there is almost no cheese on this ""pizza"". I was sorely disappointed after checking out the pics, seeing their high rating, I was expecting much more. Hopefully you read this in time so you can save your hard earned money for a more substantial pizza.  What they serve here is disgraceful."
"Not impress at all... Came in on a Wednesday night before the rush and the pizza was just basically bready. Major lack of sauce and cheese!! Our pizza wasn't even cut symmetrically, let alone it was even barely cut we have to use the pizza scooper to get a finer cut before putting it on to the plate. Been yearning to try this place out but left pretty disappointed. We got a sausage and pepperoni pizza and those two ingredients were point on. But the sauce and cheese was a different story. All of the tomato sauce fell onto the crust of the pizza and I like pizza crust and all but our pizza crust was burnt! So I wasn't even able to enjoy it as much. The thickness of the bread was major carb overload. Not enough cheese and sauce to balance it out at all. If anything, I say get thin crust so you won't be as disappointed as I am. But I never had thin crust so I'm not sure if it's any better."
"I ordered a pizza for delivery and they told me an hour and 10 minutes. Which I was fine with. Almost 2 hours in when I still haven't received my pizza I called and shawna? picked up the phone. When I asked why it's taking this long, she said ""that's how Pequod's is"". What kind of answer is that? I then said well why don't you tell people 2 hours instead of lie and say only an hour? She said ""that's how Pequod's is. I asked for a manager and she hung up the phone on me. Horrible customer service! I will not be ordering from this place ever again and I hope this review helps other people if they don't receive there food when they were told they were going to get it."
"Major disappointment. It was the crust/base.  At this place deep dish means a whole lot of bread with a small amount of toppings.  We went to Giordano's and Lou Malnati's the two nights prior and based on the reviews thought we were saving the best for last.  Nope!  It was ok but certainly not in the same league as the others.  Way too much dough and average quality toppings. Waitress was ok, decor was like a dive bar (which I like when the food is outstanding), wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back."
"I start to say pizza at its best! Although service need some work. I ordered my food 45 minutes in advance. Got there and hostess was not pleasing me at all. I Asked for regular monthly table, and she lost it. Finally, gave in and embarrasses her self in front of other customer. When I sat down pizza took another 45 minutes. Hostess name : Stacy I will come back for pizza and hope for better service."
"I don't get it. I'm more of a thin crust pizza gal, but even so, there's just way too much crust and not enough sauce. Then if you order extra sauce / ranch dressing to make the pizza more palatable, they charge you extra. $2 for a ramekin of bottled ranch dressing? Come on. And it takes a good 45 minutes for the pizza to come.  Why there is constantly a line outside, I will never understand. I can check the box on this place and don't ever have to go back now."
"Good pizza, but don't ever order this place for catering or delivery. 3 times I've called 48 hours before, and they ALWAYS lose the order.They have no system in place to keep them straight. The answer I always get is ""the register prints it up the day you call, but it was put in the wrong place in the kitchen"". You may say, ""Why not just call the same day?"" To that I say, ""Because they don't open until 10 and if I need a lunch catering order, they wouldn't have enough time to fulfill it."" When I called today to check where our 11:45 order was (it was 11:50 when I called). After the person answering the phone couldn't find the order, then I was put on hold and a manager came to the phone, I was told ""they were running late"", when I asked how late, they said it would be here at 12:45! This is NOT A TYPO! They were going to be an entire hour late!! I asked if they WERE ""running late"" how come no one could find my order when I called?? I told them to NOT LIE about it and just admit that they lost/misplaced the order AGAIN!! They FINALLY arrived at 1:15! An hour and 1/2 hour later than I needed it for a meeting! I'd have stopped using them all together after the 2nd screw up, but occasionally someone from our office wants it instead of Malnati's. But after this time, I am done (at least they credited me for the entire order. Doesn't make it less embarrassing in front of a client when lunch is 90 minutes LATE! Get it together, guys!"
"I last had Pequods 8 years ago and it was outstanding ..so I was so looking forward to picking up my pizza. I ordered at 4:30 told it would be ready in an hour. Arrive at 5:30 give my name and pay for the pizza ( large deep dish pepperoni and sausage ).  5:45 I ask after 3 people get their carry out pizza who arrived after me ""when can I expect my pizza "". Young lady states I don't know "". I wait another 10 minutes watch 2 more people receive their pizzas and ask the young lady Is there a problem.  She asks my name  and she looks and says it just came up but she needs to take a few more tickets because they're backed up.. A manager appears and has a brief conversation and takes the tickets ..I'm waiting it's now 6:15.  He comes out with three pizzas mine is on top!  I take the pizza and despite the wait anxious to get home and taste it!  I've had deep dish pizza and this pizza was way too much like pizza bread!   Too puffy and doughy!  The flavor is good but not what I remembered taste wise. I was and am very disappointed!!!  Sorry people but I don't agree that this is a pizza worth the wait or price."
"Went here expecting SO much more than I actually got. Pizza was really not that good. I would honestly say that Giordano's, Gino's East, even Lou Malnati's are all a million times better than the crust/sauce/cheese here. The staff was very inattentive and careless. It took her about 13-14 minutes to bring our drinks, after we waited about 30 to be seated and 10 to be greeted by a server. We ordered our pizza which took about 40 minutes to make (super reasonable for a deep dish). After trying to get her attention for about 15 minutes after being completely done with eating our food (which took about 25 minutes because we were STARVING), we told her (our server) that we were in a rush so head out and if she could bring our check. She was rushed and said okay and brought us our checks. We put in our card and she took the payment and we did not see her for the next 40 minutes, after requesting her to please hurry up because we were running late at this point. I have never been this disappointed with a place's food AND service (well, lack of service, actually). Save your taste buds, go somewhere else. Actually, go anywhere else. This place sucks."
"If you plan on coming here on the weekend, make sure you call hours ahead of time to get priority seating once you get there. The place is super crowded on weekends, with hour waits for pizza. The service was okay (could have been better). After waiting an hour for pizza, I thought it would be on the same level of delicious as Lou Malnati's. The pizza was burned, and it tasted like Tombstone frozen pizza. The bread was too dry. Not my kind of pizza."
"So we waited 2+ hours for our pizza to be delivered. When we called 1h30 in, the lady on the phone told us it should have been delivered 10 min ago, and to call her back 15 mins later in case it still didn't show. When we called back 15 min later, she said to be patient and it would be 20 more minutes but she ""didn't have a gps on the car"". She did not call the driver. Thanks Pequod's for the service, you could use staff training."
"This was the second place we tried on our quest to taste ""famous"" Chicago pizza. So far we're not understanding how these places have earned their reputations.We ordered our pizza to be delivered and it came in an hour. That was perfectly fine with us (it was a Saturday night and was actually delivered on the lower end of the time frame I was given). Pizza arrived hot and fresh.Just to clarify, Pequad's does not make a deep dish pizza. I see a lot of reviews calling their pizza deep dish and it's not, it's a pan pizza, which means it's a very thick crust. We knew this before we ordered and we are fans of pan pizzas, so this wasn't a surprise for us. We ordered a personal sized pepperoni, and a large pineapple.Overall, the pizza was edible. Sauce was mild in flavor (but at least it had some flavor compared to the other place we tried), there wasn't a ton of cheese (this could be good, or bad depending on your preference), and the crust had no flavor and was way too dry. I don't think I've ever had pizza crust fall apart due to being too dry. That was the biggest downfall of this pizza...dry crust that isn't very flavorful equals a lackluster pizza. The cheese caramelization on the edge of the crust was right on the cusp of being overdone. If it had been cooked any longer that cheese would have been burnt to an inedible state. Thank goodness it wasn't cooked to that point, but it was really close. Maybe if it was cooked a couple minutes less the crust wouldn't have been so dry and the caramelized cheese along the edges would have been in a more enjoyable state I don't eat dairy or eggs and I decided to in order to find out what makes Chicago's pizza great. So far that decision hasn't been worthwhile. You're letting me down Chicago!"
"Really bad service, long wait and waitress didn't understand the basics of food service.  Our app and salad were average at best, pizza was ok but disappointing based on our expectations.  Way too little cheese and Lou's crust is way better."
"Not worth the wait at all.  We arrived at 7:30, were seated at 8:45, and weren't served until 10:40. I was fully prepared to wait but quite frankly almost two hours for food is ridiculous. Manager obviously didn't care when we complained and I'm 99% confident that they gave our order to the table across from us and that's why it took so long to be served. And the pizza was lackluster even though I was ravenous by the time it arrived. Overhyped and underwhelming. Beddia in Philly has one man making pies and they are always slammed b/c of their Bon Apetit review and yet they manage to keep their shit together and consistently deliver. No excuse. Figure it out."
This is my LEAST favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago. The burnt Carmel crust was disgusting. Def won't be returning.
"I've tried this restaurant once due to a friend's glowing recommendation, and was severely disappointed. We ordered delivery, so in fairness I haven't tried in person, but to say the order was botched would be an understatement. My fiancé and I ordered two pizzas and a salad. She is a vegetarian, so naturally we ordered a vegetarian friendly pizza.  Her pizza came overly dry, with very little sauce, and cold veggies. My pizza came with burnt crust, and very poorly distributed sauce and ingredients. The salad never came. The driver didn't alert me to it, and when I asked where it was he blamed the kitchen and said he only takes what they give him and doesn't have time to confirm the order. He offered me the cash equivalent to the salad since I paid with a card, and that he couldn't run the salad back to me since he was too busy. Is this what you call customer service? I called and asked for the manager. She replied with ""what would you like us to do, we're busy"".  What I would like is for you to take a basic level class in customer service and give a customer what they pay for.  She was useless and unapologetic. Do not recommend. Won't be trying them again."
"Waited an hour and a half for deep dish.  It was good, but not the best pizza I've had in Chicago.  I'm gonna have to say, not worth the wait."
"WOW WTH!!!! Never thought I'd be writing this review...... I've been going to both Pequod's locations for 20 plus years never had anything but great food and a nice wait staff. All changed tonight!!! Our deep dish pie was so dry I couldn't get through once slice, it was TERRIBLE, zero flavor, and get this with my two friends still eating, and a fresh round of beers our waitress asked if she could box our pizza to go and get our check, (thinking to myself WTF?) I replied really do you want us to leave?????"
I'm not even two blocks outside of the delivery zone and the woman taking orders Friday night wouldn't even entertain the idea of delivery.
So I ordered a full order of pasta with a side salad specifically asked for marinara sauce on top of the pasta with the melted cheese I hope I get the post a picture because they are as dry as can be no Parmesan cheese at all maybe I'm supposed to request that but actually it should automatically come with it so that will go in the garbage because I work 12-hour shifts and there's no way I'm going to wait 12 hours to eat and hopefully the salad will fill me up I will never order from them again!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!
"I have heard about Pequod's Pizza from several friends as the best pizza in town. This is a very popular place and loved by many. I could tell from how crowded it was when I went to pick up my order. Although my pick up time was 7 PM, I was standing there in the restaurant along with many others for 45 minutes until my order was ready. The hostess made it sound that it was normal and she was unapologetic for the wait time. Putting that aside, I was extremely disappointed with this pizza. Its definitely not for everybody. I did not care for the crust or the ingredients. The sauce was pretty good but everything else tasted bland."
"The atmosphere: We got here before the rush on a Friday evening (around 6pm) so I can't complain about the wait, but shortly after it got very busy. All the take out order individuals cram into the small space which is uncomfortable for the seated patrons. The pizza: Dry (almost burnt) crust. Like everyone else says, the ratio of bread to everything else on the pizza is too much. The cheese is very stringy and you feel like you have to chew each bite for ten minutes so you don't choke on it. For all the toppings I ordered there was zero flavor, where's the seasoning? I've definitely had better and I wouldn't suggest this to a friend."
"We were excited to try a new deep dish pizza, but unfortunately were extremely disappointed. Our waitress seemed bothered by our request and was a bit rude. We ordered well done hot wings, were given regular BBQ wings, and when the waitress was informed, a different waiter bought out the same BBQ wings cooked a bit longer with the same BBQ sauce on it and some hot sauce on the side. A hair was found in one of our personal deep dish pizzas and the others weren't that great. Finally, splitting our bill was a big to do, we were charged more for the drinks when she split the check. We definitely won't be returning."
"Refusing to serve alcohol to a group of people because you can't realize the difference in a disability and being inebriated. Joel, you're an idiot and have no business having anything to do with customer service. Shameful."
"I'm not sure why this pizza is so talked about in Chicago! I had to see what the fuss was about, so I ordered a personal pepperoni deep dish and a thin slice of cheese (yes, I like food). The thin slice was just like any cheap greasy slice, nothing really to it. I was excited about the deep dish however, since I've heard great things. I have to say... this is NOT real Chicago style deep dish. It is a VERY thick slice of bread with minimal sauce and minimal cheese. Chicago style pizza should be minimal crust, and a whole lot of cheese. I was extremely disappointed."
The pizza here is absolutely horrible. I don't get the hype on this place. But I tried it once and never again! The service sucked. Food took FOREVER for us to get it. And when it came it was super burnt and probably the worst pizza I've ever had.
"Hair in salad and brown lettuce, item left off pizza, delivery late. Very dissatisfied."
"After coming here two years ago, I was excited to come back. Unfortunately I was terribly disappointed! Completely tasteless and a strange consistency. Will not be back!"
We were very disappointed in our pizza. It was so thick and doughy. The sauce was nothing special and the toppings were sparse. It was mostly bread. There was mention of cheesy crust. This was just burned crust. After reading all the recommendations it was surprisingly bad.  We did not eat our pizza and neither did our dog when we took it home.  I just felt compelled to add our opinions. There were four of us and we were all in agreement. We will not go back. And we waited close to two hours to get in.
"So we see all these fabulous review to be extremely disappointed. Delivery took 1 hour 50 mins and pizza was not good - crust was awful. On top of all, they forgot to bring the appetizer for delivery and will not provide full refund. Will NOT return"
"Kind of disappointed by the pizza here. It was good, but there was too much dough for my taste. My friends loved the place though. If you like a cornmeal crust then this is definitely the place for you."
"When I was visiting Chicago, I wanted to try this famed establishment. I got this pizza delivered to the hotel, which arrived in a timely fashion and was still very hot. I was not a fan of their toppings... the green peppers were in huge chunks and the whole pizza was covered in a thick layer of pepperoni. When I started eating it, I realized that this is not traditional Chicago deep dish (which is my own fault, their website says they make pan pizza). The dough was super thick and soggy. Total deal-breaker."
"Heard great things, decided to order and have it delivered. When we called we were advised it would take 1hr 45 minutes  - 2 hours, no big deal. When 2 1/2 hours passed and still no delivery, we called only to be told they were really busy and short delivery drivers. Driver showed up 3 hours after we ordered and had a meltdown in the lobby of our building, refusing to bring the pizza to our door and left with the pizza. Needless to say, there are too many other good pizza places in Chicago to deal with this, you only get one chance, never again."
"Two words: Underwhelming. Disappointing.But this review is solely for the ""thin-crust"" pizza.I feel like I'm the only Chicagoan (or visitor of any kind) who has something bad to say but I have to say it for anyone who, like me, actually don't like thick pizzas. Sorry, Chicago, but I love me some NY-style pizza. It's the real thing. :PI was with friends who wanted to try the place and thought I'd have a great experience like the many other patrons.However, I guess my first mistake was getting the thin-crust, which is not what they're known for. As I am not a fan of other pizzas, I thought this would be my best bet. For the three of us, the pizzas took 45 minutes.As soon as my pizza arrived, I was disappointed. It was not thin-crust at all. The outer edge where you hold it was really very cushiony, and the rest was just normal thickness. I knew I wouldn't find NY-style but Pequod's definition of thin-crust is way off.But that wasn't really what bothered me. The flavor was just not there. There was nothing about the crust that tasted good (my friends who got pan pizzas said their crust was amazing, so I was envious!). It was really just like plain white bread. The cheese literally sat on the pizza in one sad, rubbery clump, not integrated with any of the vegetables I had selected (they tasted fine but were completely unseasoned). I could only stomach two slices as I was hungry before I just felt like I was eating cheap white bread with plasticy/fake white cheese. Honestly, I've had way better pizzas at Giordanos if you want to talk hyped-up places. Even Blaze Pizza, a franchise, turned out better. Not to mention Dimo's in Wrigleyville which has fantastic pizza. And, crust aside, they win when it comes solely to flavor.My friends were happy with their pan pizzas, though. But if you only like NY-style pizza as I do, don't go even if your friends are raving about it. Let them experience it without you unless you're willing to go for the pan pizza (like I said, I can't speak to it, but I hear it's good and my friends who tried mine agreed it was pretty lame). It's totally not worth the wait and money."
"I'm only giving it two stars because the staff was nice and the garlic bread was good.  Given the reviews and the line, I was absolutely in shock about the rest of the food.  The pizza was terrible.  Utterly tasteless.  Seriously, Dominos is better.  Completely disappointed."
Pizza tastes good but it's too much bread and not enough cheese. Salads are fine but the apps are below-bar-quality. The bathrooms are disgusting but I guess this is really more of a sports bar with pizza than a restaurant. Service is uneven which I suppose is understandable given what a madhouse this place usually is. Have not tried delivery because I don't want to wait that long.
"The lines to get into this place in the evenings are insaaaaane. That's probably the one reason why I felt like I had to get in here b/c I was too afraid I'd be missing out on the Chicago deep dish experience (having already been disappointed by Giordano's and Lou Malnati's).When I finally got my pan pizza (Sausage, Spinach, and Mushroom) admittedly it looked awesome and when my slice was served, the stretch on the cheese could've gone across the room, but wow the pizza was...bland! The sauce wasn't intensely flavored and they were pretty stingy on the sausage. Not only that the pizza pie dough itself wasn't very flavorful; didn't have that yeasty quality you'd expect. They advertise the caramelization on the side of the pizza, which they delivered on, but ultimately that flavor didn't penetrate into the rest of the dough, which left for a less than amazing experience.For better deep dish pizza...Art of Pizza."
"I don't get it.  People die for this sort of pizza.  Its not that good.  I can understand that people who love that cracker bread pizza like Lou's would really like this place, but I was not a very big fan."
"Stinky. Saw my waitress 3 times. Walked in and the wait for a pizza said 40 minutes. Only bright side was sitting down immediately, however we waited over hour for pizza after we ordered. When the pizzas got there, one pan pepperoni and one thin crust cheese, it was mediocre. The only highlight of the pan pizza was the amount of pepperoni, which you could taste.  The cheese was barely there and was baked into the crust, with the rest of it tasting like cardboard. The thin crust stunk, wanted to get it off my plate. No flavor at all. To top it all off, we missed the first couple minutes of the Bulls game to see the Red Wings and the Flyers. Very disappointing as a Chicago lifer. The hype isn't worth it, find some other place to dine."
"Oh my Quod, buckle up for what may be the most ridiculous food experience I'll ever have.7p - Called in a delivery order for a small deep dish and bruschetta. Told it'll take about 90 minutes.8:45p - Called back to inquire and sat on hold for five minutes. Never a good sign. They say the pizza will be out the door in ten minutes and we're promised some kind of discount on the check (card was already charged). Aka the order was lost and they just put it in. We didn't expect it to actually be out the door in ten minutes, but nonetheless proceeded with that thought.9:30p - Call #3. My apartment is about 3 miles/15 minute drive from Pequod's, so it should have been here about 9:10 if their previous timeline is to be believed. Turns out the driver had the wrong number and couldn't get ahold of us so they drove back. Gave them the number once again and waited, wondering if death was nigh.10p - If the driver was headed right back out with our order, they should have been here by now. We get the same answer as before, which we're quick to shoot down since 10 minutes ago was 20 minutes ago. The entire charge has been voided, thankfully.10:45p - Call #5 (!!!!!!!) At this point we kind of just want to go to bed, but know we need to eat. We're finally given the manager again. This is only the second time we've spoken to him, the first being a brief apology during call #2. He apologizes profusely but you can tell he's basically at a loss for words at this point (can't blame him). No idea what happened to our order but he's going to put another pizza in. He also takes down our information and we can get a free order in the future (don't think that'll get used).11:30p - The driver finally arrives. For those keeping score at home, it took 4.5 hours to get our order. Of course, this happened when I had less than zero food in the house so we had to commit to waiting this out.Here's the worst part after all of this - it wasn't good at all. The pizza was predictably terrible since it probably went through the oven at a billion degrees to get it out. It's probably decent in normal form, but not better than the other deep dish places. Disappointing given all the rave reviews I've heard.Never, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVER (shout out to Chris Jericho) order the bruschetta. It was actually kind of hilarious. Uncooked bread slices that had been oiled and a salsa cup of what was basically pico de gallo. Chopped tomato and onion with no seasoning. Sad panda.Clearly Pequod's has earned many fans over the years, but maybe your best course would be to tread lightly."
Terrible service and food. I ordered deep dish for delivery. I asked for Italian beef as a topping and when it was delivered it was sausage. I do not eat sausage so I called to ask for a new pizza. At first the lady said sorry there's nothing they can do about it as the receipt says sausage. I specifically said Italian beef. They sent a second pizza after 1.5 hours and it was soggy and gross. Frozen grocery store pizza would have tasted better than this! So disappointing...especially because I had guest in town and this totally ruined their Chicago pizza experience.
Food was good but massive mess up the one thing I was adamant about was that there was no cheese on any of the salads what was there to much cheese for my vegan girlfriend to notice. Good going guys. Also pineapple is not a veggie it's a fruit.
"This place is deservedly well known for its pizza, I've never had a better deep dish pizza crust. Which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. That said, there are MAANY issues in this establishment which will make me and many of the other customers who gave up and left that night never come back. First off, the management of the way this place is run is absolutely horrible. People were waiting 2 to 2 and a half hours and being told it would be an hour and a half. Then, people who called in got bumped ahead of everyone else who had ALREADY been waiting for a ridiculous amount of time. Everyone was upset, there was a small uprising, and it made for a very stressful environment. Managers, get your staff and yourselves organized because that was a mess.Second, the place is completely understaffed. There was one hostess for hordes of people trying to ask questions and get their names down. Waitress were given so many tables and people to attend to that they had just enough time to drop your plate and run to the next table, so we could barely get in questions about getting more drinks or more food. The staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed.The stressful and frustrating experience is not worth it. The pizza is good, but not good enough for that to be ok. Take better care of your customers, because in that one night I saw at least five groups, not including mine, decide they weren't returning, and for good reason."
wayyyy to much bread it was like eating a bread sandwich with a little bit of cheese
"My rating is based on the delivery ordering experience.  I called in to place an order and was greeted by a very rude and impatient employee on the other end of the line.  Someone having direct communication with customers should have better customer service than what I received.  The experience was so awful that it left a distasteful flavor in my mouth before even trying Pequod's for the first time, which I was super excited for.  To make matters even worse, they got the address wrong so the poor delivery driver had to turn around to get back to my  apartment.  The pizza crust bottom was soggy by the time we got to enjoy the pizza, over an hour later.  The za was decent but nothing extraordinary.  I'll try Pequods another time as a dine in customer and hopefully have a better experience, but in the mean time I'll keep exploring other pizza options."
"Overall disappointed. A group of six of us were excited to enjoy Pequod's pizza after seeing a movie across the street earlier tonight; the pizza fulfilled our cravings but the service left us hungry for attention. We were expecting a decent wait since six of us were going around dinner time; fortunately, the wait was only around 15-20 minutes. But then realized this table was open when we originally checked in with the host staff.Our server mentioned the pizza would take about 45 minutes and suggested the combo appetizer plate while we waited. We did order it but wouldn't suggest spending money on it. We expected the wait for the pizza to be around 45 minutes as she mentioned but in the end it took well over an hour. During our wait we asked the host staff if the Cubs game could be turned on since the Bears game was on every other TV. The original TV we asked for it to be put on was denied; however, they did put it on another TV nearby but only for 5 minutes before another guest said they wanted to watch the Bears. Considering they have several TVs which all had the Bears game on, having the Cubs who had a better chance at winning the game (and did!) didn't seem to much to ask.It took forever for us to receive our bill. The bill also included a drink that one of us ordered although it was never delivered. When we mentioned that to our waitress she first questioned us but then apologized and removed it from the bill. Overall the pizza was good; however, the service needs a lot of improvement before we will return."
"Honest review: i liked ginos east better not worth the wait or the rude service.  My one star rating means i wouldnt come back not because its the worst pizza i ever ate when i give more then a star it means id go back WARNING NO RESERVATIONS: they said u have to call and put ur name on the list that didnt do anything though cause we still got the beeper!!!! :( so a 30 minute wait turned into an hour!!!! Fml! Oh wait it gets better u cannot order ur pizza while u wait  so that means u gotta wait longerfinally hallelujah we get seated we order and guess what waiting again!!!!!!! shit litterly time stands still with all the waiting! regarding the service omg there all teenagers so there either dancing hanging out or hidding in the back caught them  funny moment. Our waiter was rude she put a bunch of utensils in a cup and slammed it down then no good recomendations or was nice at all just hi and bye n she forgot things i asked her for tabasco sauce and i was watching her just stand there n she came back a while later n im like can u plz get tabasco sauce one of the worst waiters ever avoid the pretty blond waiter .Appetizer combo: comes with jalepeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms and zucchini sticks. Surprisedly the breading on all of them is really good so that means there not frozen junk food! The seasoning on the breading is good wish it had a lil more seasoning  though. The only thing i didnt like was the zucchini it was really bland like really we didnt eat them just left them there. The marinara sauce it comes with is also really good. Pan pizza: WARNING NO BACON TOPPING it came n i was like thank god im starving already cut so u dont have to struggle to eat the pizza the crust is good not to thick not to hard just like in the middle the sauce was really delicious like really the meatballs that were on it were really tender and flavorful but there was only 1 slice of a meatball on each cut of pizza the best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese crust it was really delicious like really for once i actually ate the crust and didnt discard it. The issues with the pizza was it needed salt badly my girlfriend hates salt yet even she was like wow gimme that salt shaker another issue was the actual pizza needed more cheese like there was a really serious problem with the ratio of condiments to crust when u think of deep dish u think 10 pounds of heaven not 10 pounds of crust"
"Called in for a deep dish pizza to go, told it would be an hour, which was expected. Got there and ended up waiting an additional hour for the pizza along with others who had called in. It was a Sunday night, so I could understand it being a little busy, but the fact that I had called in a to go order and had to wait 2 hours for a pizza was absolutely ridiculous. The pizza wasn't even that great when I finally got around to eating it."
"This was the worst pizza ever. Ever, in history of pizzas or pizzerias. My family and I tried to get in once since they were highly recommended after a movie at Regal, they were too busy and not friendly at all.This week, we went and finally made it! No line around 5ish pm. We had a small pan for 2 and after eating 2 small pieces, I could not move and breath the entire evening. I felt so heavy and bloated! I read the reviews and one woman was saying they don't let the crust mature and that makes you bloated, which makes sense. Basically the pizza was not done at well. It was like eating semi done crust where the cheese did not even melt. The toppings were not evenly distributed.The waitress was so indifferent, as most of the stuff, some college not caring kids.Bathroom was clean and that's the best of all, OMG.I want my money back, yes, I do. So worthless!!!!P.S. The wine list does not exist. They serve wine, but you don't know what the choices are and how much does it cost. Ridiculous!"
"Woman answered the phone. Apparently I was asking her too many questions. She huffed and hung up on me. Called back and told her I wasn't done ordering and she said that I was ""taking too long. There's a website for questions."" And she hung up AGAIN. Heard the pizza is great (didn't get a chance to order because I was hung up on twice?), but I customer service is more important to me."
"Horrible. All hype, no substance. Terrible customer service, sub-par product, and just an all around bad experience. Most overrated place in Chicago."
"It's pretty sad because I had such high hopes being that it was voted best in the nation but it let me down. Upon arrival we sat very quickly which was another sign of awesome but it went downhill from there. To start our waitress smelled due to lack of deodorant and her stench was directed to my face with her wide open arms. I overlooked it and we ordered.We ordered the stuffed crust which describes itself as cheese oozing from the crust but when we received it there was barely any cheese at all. It arrived to our table swiftly but upon our first bite, my husband and I both found a way to admit it was subpar.We decided we were full and when the waitresses walked by I said ""can we get a box and the check."" Without saying a word she used the pizza pliers to pick it up and allowed it to sit at her knee as she walked away from the kitchen with the pizza being moved around her personal space before she finally walked to the kitchen. She came back to our table without a word check on top of pizza looked away and walked off.We both looked at each other trying to figure out if we were rude to her at some point but could not think of anything as she barely came to our table in the first place.Bottom line. I will never go again and both my husband and i plan to apologize to our usual pizza place for wasting our money on such a subpar, rude and smelly experience.Side note: my husband used the washroom while there and he described it as gross and dirty."
"Pizza is great but changed their delivery zone. They didn't update the website so very confused on where they deliver to now. Either way, their delivery zone is too small and they should consider rezoning. I'm sure their customers would pay a small delivery fee."
This is a popular pizza joint...I get it.  But the fact that their employees were taking up seats on a busy Saturday night is a big no no.
"Honestly, the only reason I gave it 1 star, is because there is no 0 star rating. My friends and I showed up to try what was recommended to us as Chicago's best deep dish pizza. We waited over an hour to be seated, which was expected, and when we sat down to order we were told it would take another hour for the pizza to come out.Shortly after another hour our server came back out (for the first time since she handed us our water and took our order) to tell us that the kitchen had accidentally put a couple of extra toppings on the pizza. At this point, we were fine with that, we just wanted to eat. So when the pizza came out we realized it wasn't our pizza at all; there were no mushrooms, or jalapeños like we ordered. Just a random pizza with random toppings. The crust was burnt black, and was difficult to cut through.In Nashville we have a good Chicago style deep dish restaurant that I wanted to compare to an authentic pizza place in Chicago, and hands down the Nashville restaurant won the comparison. In fact, you can't even compare the two. That would be like comparing a 5 star steak house to McDonald's. Pequods was an outright disappointment, and I regret the 2 and a half hours of my life/vacation I wasted there."
"Customer service is shit. Don't get me wrong, I understand that when a restaurant has a substantial following, they give less shits about their customers, but this is ridiculous.  We ordered a pizza at 126 am, had to repeat my credit card number 6 times before she actually got it right. Then, we call to check on our order and the person can find no order for us. None. Gave our number, name we put it under, address, nothing can be found. Super pissed. Finally we get a manager on the phone. She says they guarantee it by 302am?  Ok. It's 303am, and guess what? No pizza.  We called back to see where it is and with a bitchy attitude says its in the same place that it has been the last two times you called. Fuck this place."
"If this review were for the pizza itself, it would be five stars. But when I called for delivery, and pulled up the delivery zone map, they refused to deliver to us. We live in Logan Square at Milwaukee and Sacramento. As you can see in the map, that is clearly within the boundaries of their delivery zone. And yet they refused to deliver. So I asked to speak to the manager, who unapologetically also refused to take the order, claiming my address ""didn't show up in their system."" You can't show one thing on your website and then just respond with ""Well I don't know what to tell ya."" Beware Logan Square residents. No Pequods for you."
A place to drink socialize and eatPizza is no worthy of the title chicago deep dishMedicinal tasteSlapped together with conflicting mix of flavors Crust was crunchy but lacked the taste of Lou MalanattisNot worth the wait or $$
never wasted time this place is run like a zoo better places in the city to spend are money at
"I've heard a lot of great things about this place - specifically the caramelized crust.  So naturally, I had to check out one of the great Chicago pizza joints while in Chicago.  The wait wasn't too bad - approximately 30 minutes on a Sunday night.  We were seated upstairs.  My only regret is that we weren't able or asked to order ahead of time.  These deep dish pizzas take a long time to cook/bake.  When the pizza arrived..... disappointment.  The caramelized crust just reminded me of BURNT crust.  The pizza was so doughy.  Toppings were sparse.  A centimeter of toppings and cheese, on top of an inch of dough.  Atkins lovers would cry.Now, it's not terrible pizza.  I still ate it.  But given all the other Chicago style pizza joints in Chicago, I wouldn't come here if I was here on vacation for just a few days."
"Tried it based on a recommendation, but not impressed.Even placing the order was a hassle...no online option, and the girl who took my call seemed like I was interrupting her at work.Got a 10"" pan (deep dish).The ingredients were not evenly dispersed, one piece (it comes cut into 4) had all pepperoni, another almost all sausage.  Couldn't see/taste the Fresh Garlic that was supposed to be added, but maybe it's all on a piece I've not had yet.The crust was OK, but not impressive.Can't recommend it."
"Overrated at its best. Location is not good, ambiance sucks and the pizza is very lackluster. Mind you I ordered a personal pan cheese only so maybe the toppings is what makes it. My pizza was pretty much burnt I wouldn't call it buttery definitely crispy and the cheese and sauce were nothing special. I would not venture here for another taste at all. Glad I went though to check out what they hype was about. Try for yourself!"
"First of all, this is not real Chicago-style deep dish pizza. Everyone needs to stop comparing it to Lou's or Giordano's.Given the hype surrounding this place, I decided to bring my friend from out of town to Pequod's to show her how amazing Chicago deep dish is. It was my first time at Pequod's as well and we were both equally underwhelmed. I wish I would have taken her to a Giordano's instead. We came in midday on a Saturday and were seated quickly. We started with a small order of buffalo wings, which did not particularly stand out, and then ordered a pizza for us to share. I was impressed with the topping options (including an italian beef option) but we stuck with pepperoni and peppers. Once it arrived, the pizza was soupy and we were disappointed to see it was mostly breading. Perhaps it would have benefited from a few more minutes in the oven, but overall there was just too much sauce.Bottom line: definitely overrated and closer to being a Detroit style pizza."
"Ordered deep dish, waited, waited. Received undercooked and burnt crust on edges and then to boot the waitress says ""it's our special crust it's not burnt"""
"Pizza is amazing but customer service leaves much to be desired. I ordered a pizza to be delivered at a certain time to a certain bar at a specific time, to ensure that someone was there to recieve it. They delivered the pizza 40 minutes early when no one was from our party was even at the bar. I called their location once I learned of this early delivery and told them that it was unacceptable as no one was there to recieve it and was asked to be delivered around a certain time for a reason, which I was told was you ok when I asked before ordering the pizza. When I called the location to report the descrepency of delivery and asked to talk to a manager I was first transferred to someone who was not a manager then hung up on when I requested a manager again. When I called i.immediately back and asked for a manager the manager gave me an attitude about their discrepancy and was told that another pizza would be delivered at the original requested time to compemsate , to which as of now 3 hours later it still has not been delivered and their customer service leaves much to be desired. Therefore I am giving them 1 star purely on their customer service and inability to maintain their worrd."
"This was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. I arrived with my party at 6:30 pm, and was told it would be an hour and a half wait to be seated.At 8:15 pm, we were told by the host that people who called ahead got to skip the line past people who were waiting in person outside the restaurant. I honestly don't understand this logic.After we saw a party of 4 walk in and get seated at a 6 person table before us, we left.I'm sure the food is great, but I can't say, I never found out. The service is just awful though. And with as much competition there is in Chicago for pizza, you would think the customer service would be better."
"SO OVERRATED.First of all, the fact that everyone raves about this place as the best pizza place in Chicago is pure bs. This was my first trip to Chicago and I've been hearing that this place and Lou Mal something are supposed to be the best. Boy was I SO DISAPPOINTED! I should've known when I arrived at this tiny hole in the wall looking bar scene that the fact that this place has more than 3 thousand reviews is a little suspicious and most likely due to some incentive given for checking in or writing a good review. Anyways, on to the pizza. So my husband  and I were super excited to try some really good authentic Chicago pan pizza. We ordered the cheese with mushrooms onions and olives. Visually, the pizza looked kind of dull and grayish all over, which I do not know why since all the veggies are supposed to make it look colorful. TASTE: SO BLAND and BARELY ANY CHEESE !!!!! I felt like I was eating a fat piece of bread with veggies on it. The bread to cheese ratio is so off. I hate pizza that does not have enough cheese that's the fun part ! Eating the gooey cheese with a good amount of sauce and a nice balanced crust. But anyways, this is what killed it for me. Pizza Hut has more flavor than this place sadly to say. CRUST: The ONLY good part was the outer burnt edges of the pan pizza. The pan dough that the pizza is baked on however, was so bland and nothing special. COST: What also was annoying is the fact that they charge $2 which so much for each topping and they have no options to choose from, only cheese and you pick whatever toppings you want. They already charge $16 for a medium which is way overpriced anyways. For such a tiny hole in the wall they charge so much. The place definitely does not reflect the quality or taste of the pizza. Overall Review: DO NOT get fooled by the massive amount of reviews. That's the only reason I picked this place as our first Chicago pizza experience over Lou Malnatis or any other famous ones. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY here ! I honestly am so baffled at how in the heck this place is famous. SO DISAPPOINTED."
"Ordered their Pan pizza.  Crust was dense and had zero taste and was dry like aged bread.  Overall, totally subpar experience.  Ordered as a delivery, and it came 25 mins late.  No apologies offered, and person at store hung up on me when I asked if it would close to 30 mins late.Pass."
"The pizza was amazing, as always. The service this time? Not so much. Our server was so incredibly rude with her snarky comments. My friend asked her a question about a beverage and the waitress asked my friend if she just got out of a shelter lol ...... On top of that, I asked if I could order a pizza to-go at the very beginning of our visit, knowing that the pizzas take a while to cook, and she laughed and replied with ""Remind me to do that later, I won't remember"". I assumed she would come back at least once while we ate so I can do so, but she never came back to check up on us. She came back at the very end with our checks. I then reminded her about the to-go pizza and she sighed and explained that it would've been easier to just give me the check she had ready for me. After giving her a confused look,  she then reassured me she can add it on. I asked her to order the same pizza I previously ordered and she said ""oh it's so cute how you think I remember what pizza you got"" (as she's holding my check that clearly says the pizza I had just ordered).How does this lady still have a job?! So rude!! Wish I got her name. Hope the owner reads these reviews.. I was at table 22 from ~2-4 o clock on Thursday December 28th. I wouldn't be surprised if most of these terrible service reviews are about her."
"I think this is actually a long-running Punk'd type thing, where they must be filming people waiting forever and then pretending to like the worst pizza I've ever had (worse than Papa Johns).  Yeah the crust gets caramelized into whatever is stuck on the bottom of your oven.  You can eat that with no wait, just grab a spatula and get at your oven!!I do not get the hype.  Giordano's for life."
"We decided to go with Pequods for deep dish after several recommendations from my local friends. The other options as many of you looking for pizza in Chicago May know are Lous, Giordannos and other small pizza joints. Let me start with the wait time, we arrived on Saturday around 6:45pm at which point we were told that the wait time would be anywhere between 2 to 2 and a half hours but before receiving a pager we had to come back to check in an hour before our estimated time of seating. 2 hours and later and we finally receive a pager and we get seated around 9:40pm. That's almost 3 hours of wait time just to be seated. After being seated we have to wait another hour just to get the pizza. Anyone who knows the place might say that because it was a Saturday the wait was expected and that's my fault for making the conscientious decision to stay and wait, however I stayed due to the high reviews. Here is where the pizza does not merit the wait. The pizza crust had a good taste but it was very hard to chew. The taste of the entire pizza was underwhelming despite having pepperoni, meatballs, onions, mushrooms and green peppers. Hope this helps anyone deciding to try this place. In my opinion it's overrated."
"Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing - we didn't have enough time for deep dish so we got the thin crust. I've never in my life had a piece of pizza I didn't think was worth finishing - even elementary school pizza. I subscribe to the pizza/sex mentality - even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. Not the case with this pizza - it was not worth finishing and I didn't even try."
"Great pizza! My husband and I love this place but only get it once in a while because we try to stay relatively healthy. So when we do order we are really looking forward to it. I've had them deliver to my home before, but this time I'm being told I'm outside of the delivery zone. When I  checked their website I found that  I am well within the zone. I call back to clarify and am immediately met with an attitude (I guess I was annoying them. Idk. This was a different person). When I asked what exactly their boundaries were the person hung up 9 on me. I call back again because now I'm upset and want to talk to a manager. I'm immediately put in hold and a manager answers. I inform her that her staff is hanging up on people and that's when she again starts saying that I'm outside of the zone. So I inform at this point I'm no longer interested in their product and was simply asking a question to her staff. That's when I get a full explanation about a glitch in the system that is making things difficult for them. If that full explanation had been given the first time, instead of me getting shut down for asking questions, I might go back. But they've lost my business for good. Staff seemed to really care less about turning away business."
"The food was not good, our pizza was wrong and it had hair in it. The server saw the hair and continued to serve the pizza. They sat 5 of us at a 2 seat table, then tried to put one of our pizzas on a chair because there wasn't enough space in the table.  The manager trued to make it better but he just gave us an over cooked pepperoni pizza and threw undercooked sausage on it, there was barely any sauce on the pizza. My family was visiting from out of town and we went there because I heard great things. The pizza sucks. Little Caesar's is better than this place."
"Pizza and bruschetta were good. Waitress was nice. We were seated upstairs - sign on the entrance said they're open until 2am. No one told us the upstairs closed at 11pm so we were taking our time, completely unaware. When we realized we were the only ones left we asked the waitress and finished quickly to get out but overheard one of the workers - small guy with a puffy bob - talking to our waitress about how ""these bitches are taking their time"". Just make sure customers are aware of the different closing times. No need to be passive aggressive."
"The deep dish crust is spongy. It is like eating toasted English muffin with toppings on top. Their thin crust is more decent. Ultimately, I don't recommend it nor would I serve it for my guests. Lou Malnatis is still #1 for me."
"My mom is in town visiting from Texas. She saw this place on the Travel Network and wanted to give it a try. I'm not a huge deep dish fan but that's what my mom wanted so we got it. I prefer/love Lou Malnati's. This pizza taste like they got a loaf of bread put some toppings over it and stuck it in the oven. The cheese was overdone around the sides (my mom said that's there ""thing"" which was weird to me but I digress). We ordered delivery and it took about 2 hours to get here, which isn't terrible given how long it takes to make deep dish pizza. The woman who took our order seemed rushed and unpleasant. The sausage was good, therefore maybe I'll go back and try thin crust one day. I told my mom that as a Chicagoan I would be ashamed if someone from out of town tried this and thought this was what deep dish is about."
"I came here, because I've always heard great things about this place. I would definitely direct friends from out of town to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's though. I don't know if my experience was out of the ordinary, but the service was not great as the waitress was not attentive & the deep dish was very dry and bland. It also took about an hour for our pizza to come out."
"I've been to Pequod's a few times before and was excited to go with some friends who were in from out of town this weekend. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday and were a bit surprised to find there was already a 30 - 45 minute wait for a party of 5. (This was the point we should've just gone somewhere else.)We were seated at 5pm and ordered our pizza and an appetizer around 5:15. No one mentioned a longer wait time on food that evening. The appetizer came out almost immediately and then our server all but disappeared.Around 6:15 I was able to flag her down and ask if she knew the status of our pizza, expecting it to be up soon. She came back about five minutes later to tell us she wasn't sure what had happened but a manager would be coming. A manager then came with nothing to report, returning again to tell us that the ticket was lost, they didn't do it on purpose, and it would be out in ten minutes. He also vented to us about their three hour wait for a table. (Uh, maybe because you can't keep orders straight in your kitchen?) When a member of our group expressed his frustration, he said he'd ""do something for us"" on the bill.Look, I've worked in the service industry. I get that people make mistakes. But the manager couldn't even be bothered to apologize! Our food eventually came about 90 minutes after we ordered it, and the pizza was good, but it wasn't worth the inattentive service and long wait.Aaaaaand then the bill came -- with no discount given despite the manager's promise to do something for us. We paid it all and just left because we were all ready to go home at that point.It'll be a long time before I visit again."
"I've gotten Pequod's a couple of times now, and I don't think that I'll be doing so again.  The first time I ordered pick-up while I was running errands, and was told it would be a 45-60 minute wait on the pizza.  That was fine, and when I showed up, my order was completely wrong.  I ordered a thin crust with peppers and mushrooms, and was given a deep-dish pizza with only mushrooms.  When I complained to the staff, I was told that it would take another 30+ minutes for them to get my correct order out to me (that time included being given ""priority"" so that my pizza would be out more quickly).  No attempt to make things right were offered as far as a discount off a future pizza or knocking the price down on the current one.The second time I was in the area with relatives from out of town, and happened to be in the area, so we stopped by to put our name on the list.  We intentionally went before the dinner rush (about 5:30PM) because I know how crowded it can get.  We were told 45-60 minutes for a table, which was fine.  Fast forward to 7:30PM and we were still waiting for a table and were pretty hangry at that point.  I would have been fine if we showed up and they told us that there was a two hour wait.  We would have simply went somewhere else, but every time we asked about the status of our table, we were told that one was opening up and would be the next to get seated.  We finally had to suggest to the hostess that we be seated around a high-top table (which for 6 people is a tight squeeze), and I never felt that anyone even cared about the poor service that was provided.  I really wanted to like this place, but it seems to me that they feel that they can treat customers however they want because if they lose one or two, they'll have more lining up sooner or later."
"The worst customer service and delivery. We ordered at 5pm because we knew it would be busy on the weekend and after 2 hours called to check. They said they tried to deliver, but we were sitting home the entire time. They offered to redeliver the 2.5 hour old Pizza or make a new one that would take another hour to deliver. Never again."
This used to be one of my favorite pizza places in the city. Great for someone who just can't get on board with deep dish but wants something more than just thin crust. However we attempted to go here at 4pm on a Saturday and were told we would not be seated with our baby. In case you haven't been there before it's not fine dining. It's a pizza joint. We won't be ordering from here again.
"When you go to a pizza place, you don't go there for health food. But that's what these trendies at Pequod's think they're doing. If you like raw vegetables on your pizza - this is the joint for you. But if you just want to caloricly, throw caution to the wind, occasionally, as most  people do when they go out for pizza, there are innumerable places nearby where you can get a real pizza and an enjoyable pizza experience. You can eat your salad at home, anytime."
"A couple of servers at Alinea recommended this place, so I had high expectations. There's barely any cheese. The crust is about 7/8 of the pizza, the sausage wasn't fully cooked and it's burnt to a crisp. Possibly the worst pizza I've had in Chicago. I'd rather eat 10 pies from horrible Giordano's than one slice of this trash. Dominoes would be a massive improvement."
"Not exactly the best deep dish pizza in town. However, the sauce was probably the best part of eating this extra doughy pie. Sorry but I would rather order some Domino's pizza."
"I guess I just don't get it. First off, I don't really care for ""Chicago Deep Dish."" But during a tour of the best rated pizza restaurants in Chicago we were sure to try both deep dish and thin crust at those places that offered both. The crust at Pequod's reminds me of Jiffy Baking Mix biscuits you might have with some sausage gravy and hash browns. Of the deep dish places we went, this was by far the most disappointing.The people here (customers and employees) were nice, but the pizza is not the best we had in Chicago, let alone on a level with NY, LA, SF, etc."
"Just received my delivery...absolutely yuck. Thin Crust Basil, Tomatoe & Garlic was undercooked, had no basil & too garlicky (& I looove garlic). Thin Crust Half Pepperoni & Half Sausage was a thick crust, burnt & all pepperoni & all sausage. Neither pizza had any taste. Appetizer Sampler was inedible. Will never ever eat Pequod's again."
"I heard many good reviews about this place, and I actually drove twenty minutes across town to go there.Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the front desk/waitresses attitude. I felt unwelcomed. They gave me a buzzer, and told me to wait for an hour. While me and my friend stood up waiting in a clustered place, I go to ask about the wait, I get a rude reply back from one of them, ""It's an hour wait"" I know it's an hour wait, I just want to how longer I have to wait since I am sure it was more than twenty minutes standing for my turn.At the end, I handed in the buzzer and just left.Thanks for the welcoming! Keep up this low attitude, and you'll lose that good reputation in no time."
"Pequods pizza was a bit disappointing, I'm already not a fan of deep dish pizza (New York Pizza all day e'ry day) but when in Rome...Pequods supposedly has an amazing crust, I must disagree, my crust had a doughy consistency (like not completely cooked, but come on, you made me wait 40 minutes for it...) the toppings were stingy and I paid for a premium topping (meatball) and barely got any.  The pizza seemed under seasoned and just was pretty meh.  The meatball I must say was tasty, it wasn't tough and and a decent flavor on its own but not enough to carry the pizzaService wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing either..."
"They are getting 2 stars because I know how great their pizza can be...Unfortunately, I didn't even have the chance to eat here the other night:I made a reservation last week with a very friendly hostess over the phone - and all was great, and I was looking forward to taking my family that was visiting from out of town.We showed up at 6pm on a Sunday (our reservation time). One of the FIVE... yes FIVE hostesses standing there told me it would be atleast another 45 minutes. They then went on to tell me that they don't take reservations. WHAT?!? They tried explaining that 'I was jumping the wait-list with my called-in reservation from the week before'. (which by the way, if this is a 'thing'- this arrangement was never brought to our attention over the phone and we thought we were making a NORMAL reservation)That night, we ate at Giordanos and it was wonderful.Pequod's has definitely lost me as a patron with their poor customer service, ridiculousness to reservations/no reservations, and for having 5 hostesses (go bus a table and help out your fellow servers!)"
"Great place, great food, today unfortunately the service did not meet up to par. Waitress/server Never gave her name and just seemed to be in a rush. Our order was taken and she made sure we always had drinks but a bit friendlier would've worked too. When you get charged for a slice of cake for a birthday girl, you know this ain't the place to celebrate in the future."
"The wait to even get the pizza was very ridiculous. It took 2 hours for pick up. I expected a lot more from their pizza since the wait was so long, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of really thick crusted pizza? So maybe I'm a little bias. But this pizza was just way too doughey for me. The flavor of the pizza was also okay. I've read a lot of reviews saying we should add extra sauce and extra cheese, but that was probably the worst decision to be made. Too much sauce and cheese and not enough meat. The ingredients were definitely fresh though. I give them that."
"Ok i read so many great things about this place, was gonna go to Berts but didnt want to travel the extra distance, considering he started Pequads I figured it would be close. Well this one going down in institutional longevity, which means they been around so long they sucked the locals into thinking they were good. Tasted like a flavorless piece of Italian bread with spaghetti sauce on it, and some burnt cheese on edge of crust. Disappointing. Lous kills you by miles."
"I went here on a pizza tour a year ago and thought it was fantastic so I was really excited to come back. I felt really let down today. Waited an hour for a table.  Once we sat down and placed our order we knew it would be about another hour so we got their garlic cheesy bread,  it's worse than the frozen stuff from the grocery store. It was rock hard and was only made edible because of the sauce we got with it. When our pizza came it was obviously overdone. The bottom layer of crust was black.  Even if I peeled off the burnt parts it was still dry and lacked flavor. Just utterly disappointing after a 2 hour wait."
"Pizza was marginal and service was average at best. Heard a lot of good things about this place from the locals,but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. One and done for me."
"It's seriously just a pan pizza. It's not amazing or anything special. I feel bad saying something bad about a restaurant. It's good pizza but I don't think it was worth the price... I like flavorful foods and unique food. I had to put salt on my pizza. If your ever thinking ""man I want some decent pizza"" this is the place for you! It's alright nothing spectacular or anything to rave about."
"This place used to be great but they have been overwhelmed and have not figured out how to deal with the volume.  I ordered a pizza at 5:30 on a Saturday night and was told it would be 1:20.  I showed up at 6:50 and waited for an hour, asking three times if there was an update on my order and getting no answer, before I got two pizzas that had obviously been sitting in the warmer for quite some time.  Very disappointing."
"Hype. I really wanted to like it because people rave about it, but its just not good. First of all. This is not deep dish pizza. Its pan pizza. So if you're expecting a pizza like Lou's or Giordano's, go there, because this is not the deep dish you know and love. Pequod's pizza is more like a focaccia bread, very doughy, with a little bit of sauce and toppings and a hint of cheese. If you cut it in half it would probably make great sandwich bread. What toppings there are, are very fresh and of good quality.The best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese on the crust. Burnt cheese crust really shouldn't be the highlight of your deep dish pizza though. The wait is usually long and even if you place your order ahead of time, you'll likely be waiting anyway. Its like they're doing you a favor serving you bread with some sauce on it. Skip Pequod's and Burt's Place for that matter and go anywhere else for pizza."
"Hate to be hard on a small business, but this is NOT Chicago-style deep dish pizza. The ""deep dish"" option was just a thicker crust. I mean this pizza was so bad I took the time to take a picture and warn my Chicago friends. Would I be mad if I bought this for $10? No. But I paid a lot more than $10. Save yourself the time and money and get a gas station za instead."
"Use to always buy from here, it was one of our favorite places for pizza. Thank God it's not our only place we like to order from. Ordered our normal double pepperoni pizza, extra pizza sauce, extra cooked. Gave my name, exact address including my apartment number and then proceeded to wait for our pizza to be delivered. We waited and waited but our pizza never came. We finally fell asleep a little after 1:00 a.m. Woke up the next morning and had two missed calls from Peqoud's, one at 1:23am and another at 1:30am. I called in my order at 11:48pm. So I called Peqoud's again tonight to explain that we paid for our pizza but never even got a knock on the door, despite me giving them my apartment number(we have a door man to let them into the lobby by the way so no excuse for not coming to our apartment.) The nice lady who answered the phone explained the situation to the manager on duty tonight(Friday night on August 4, 2017) and informed me that the manager said they tried to call twice but I never picked up the phone so they are not responsible for us not receiving the product that we already paid for. I am a professional in the hospitality industry and I am appalled at the response by the management at Pequod's. You expect your customers to not only pay you for a product, but then do the extra work of chasing you down to make sure they receive it? I apologize Pequod's, but I was never taught that this was the way a hospitality establishment was to conduct itself while I was majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management at Purdue University. Maybe that's why we always rank in the top of the nation for our School of Hospitality and Tourism Management because we choose to educate our future industry leaders on proper etiquette in this industry. I don't want to insult another school by attempting to guess where you source your managers from, but they'd never make it past the first interview if it were my business. So, as happy as I would like to be to continue ordering from you, I will not be doing so for I have little tolerance for bad customer service. That includes not ordering from you for my employees when they work late as I have done the last two months."
Good luck with delivery here. Waited over two hours and was lied to about the pizza being on its way. Will NEVER order from this place again.
"Wait time is always really long whether you're picking up or waiting to be seated. The pizza seems pretty average to below-average to me, not sure what the hype is all about."
Whoever answers the phone for late night delivery is a total butthole. Cool customer service guys.
"Three and a forty-five minutes. That's how long it took. We arrived at 5:15p on a Saturday and was told it would be an hour and a half wait. Took 2 hours and three times asking to get a seat. Then after we sat, took and hour and a forty-five minutes before we got the pizza. By the time we got the food, we didn't even want to eat it. It was good pizza, but not good enough to wait almost 4 hours."
"This place is full of millennials who are in the business of waiting tables not to service tables but who think they deserve a tip for whatever service they choose to give. We were told by a fat waitress who looked like she got to eat for free that slices would be ready in 15 minutes and whole pizzas took 45 minutes. So we ordered a slice and a sandwich.  A couple got seated next to us but after 20 minutes of no service decided to go to the restaurant across the street. Then the waitress decides to come by saying, ""Oh, you changed your mind?"" We had to question why the order was taking so long after 35 minutes. We constantly had to flag this woman down to get refills. Then she was quick to drop off the check and say its seems you are in a hurry here is your check.  Then a minute later is asking if we need change. Why can't wait staff get it in there heads that it is, I will be right back with your change NOT will you be needing change? When they ask that i say yes i will be and then give them a lower or no tip at all.  Oh and the food was overpriced, charging extra on top of the already overprice sandwich for cheese $1.35 a slice and .80 for sweet peppers on a meatball sandwich priced at $7.45. Food presentation wasn't bad but did not taste as good as it looked."
"Really disappointed with my experience today. Ordered ONE pizza for delivery at 12:45. After two calls to the restaurant, the pizza finally arrived at 3:30pm, cold and stale tasting. The saying ""pizza is like sex, even when it's bad it's good"" couldn't be less true here. All this wait for less than sub par pizza. Will not be ordering here again."
"Good, fast service, except the pizza was not as good.Extra greasy. The crust and cheese were tasteless, but the pepperoni was alright.Two slices of good pizza are worth $10, but not this pizza"
"You may want to rethink fat shaming in your restaurant. I was visiting a friend in Chicago recently and she brought me to Pequod's. Great pizza! But when I went to the bathroom there was a Bally's Fitness poster that said, ""Yeah, maybe it does make your butt look big."" Really? And in a Pizzeria? Also, there was nothing of the sort in the Men's restroom. Nice one Bally's! Nice on Pequod's!"
"We had eaten pizza at this restaurant twice. First time was excellent we thought it might be the best pizza ever. The second time at the restaurant was still pretty good. We had out of town company and even though it's expensive ordered Pequod's because we wanted our guest to try this delicious pizza. It was $60 not including the drivers tip for two large pizzas. One- one topping large and One- four topping large. We could have gotten two large pizza's elsewhere for  30-35 dollars less but we wanted the best so we paid the $60.I placed my order the day before. It arrived on time but it was barely warm. my husband met the guy and saw him take it out of the car and there were no bags around the box to keep it warm and for some reason sauce was smeared on the top of the bottom box. Their pizza is not good when it's not hot. We were very disappointed and not one of our guests said ""wow this pizza is good"". My husband and I agreed that we are done with Pequod's. I did call and tell the manager and he was nice enough. Said they have some problems to work out but unfortunately didn't offer a refund or anything just condolences. I think Pizza from almost anywhere else would have been better.  Also our receipt said 6:00 on it and we ordered it to arrive at 7:30 The manager said they set it up to start preparing it at 6:00. They tell you it takes 45 min to make their pizza but we have gotten it in 30 min. So my guess is they made it an hour early warmed it under a heat lamp (maybe) and didn't warm it in the car at all. It really tasted like it had been made the day before when I placed my order and was reheated and sent along. I don't think that's what they did but that is definitely the texture and taste it had. Although we will not return it is a good ( albeit pricey) pizza in house but don't waste your money on their take out. You can get a hot delicious pizza delivered to your home for a lot less money from somewhere else."
Taste is great but our crust was so burnt we couldn't even chew it. Deep dish crust is what we were looking forward to. We were starving so waiting another 40 minutes for a better pizza wasn't an option. Disappointed!
I think this might have been the most overrated place I visited in ChicagoI waited and hour and a half for a pizza that was burnt on the bottom and under-cooked in the middle. Also to make matters worse our server was petty much ignored us. She didn't refill our water or our drinks. If you are going to have sub-par food and least have good services.
"My sisters/friends and I came here on Friday, September 4th, the first stop of my Bachelorette weekend. Super excited, this places comes with great reviews. We're told there is a bit of a wait, we can go next door to the bar and we'll be called when our table is ready. No Problem, it's a Friday night so we get it. Our table is ready and we are sat, our waitress (I wish more than life itself I could remember this girls name. She was blonde with a nose ring) comes to take our drink orders. She then returns and we are ready to order, we've got a few question on the appetizers. My sister asks her ""which one is better? The mushrooms or the zucchini?"" the girl (who is clearly annoyed at this point) says ""well they are all frozen and then fried."" Our mouths dropped open as she continues to tell us that every appetizer that has any kind of breading or fried part to it, isn't by any means fresh but frozen. As we are trying to come out of our WTF just happened confusion and pick a frozen app we'd like, she then snaps ""I have other tables being seated and they are staring at me and I have to serve them too"". We were all there for the first time, we had questions and part of her HER job is to answer and assist us and she really blew our mood. Of course as she realized she had messed up, she didn't return to our table for the rest of the night. Her fellow waitresses/waiters came by to fill our drinks, deliver our food, etc.As good as the food may have been, her attitude and service totally took that away. Being someone in Customer Service, she def is not a fit."
"Hey Yelpers,So I've ordered from Pequod's before and my pizza was delicious!! I wasn't in the mood for pizza so I decided to get the mostaccioli with basil pesto sauce; that was the worst decision I could have made. I knew something was off from the color of my dish to the greasy-buttery looking noodles...Ugh ick. With a whole lot of hesitation I decided to dig in and take a bite, well that was the 2nd worst decision I made for the day...I'm 0 for 2 here folks!! That mess was so nasty I damn near gagged and puked, I even had a co-worker try it and well she too had the same response. I'm a pesto kind of girl and this dish was utterly disappointing, so glad I had an opportunity to waste $12 today!! The delivery guy was great at least and super nice!!Sincerely, I can not believe they actually thought I would eat this crap"
"Like much of my dating life, I have been consistently underwhelmed by Pequod's.  Pequod's is the place that is recommended for out of town guests who want to try ""real"" deep dish.  What's real-A really long wait, although admittedly we got in much sooner than our quoted time.A less than stellar beer selection.  How hard would it be to get more diversity?Tasteless pizza.  Yes, I said tasteless.  While there's plenty of cheese, and the crust is so-so, the sauce tastes like canned meh.  There's more flavor on the pizzas I get from Trader Joe's.The staff is not rude, but I didn't find them to be exceptionally friendly, either.I won't seek out Pequod's on my own, and I doubt I'd recommend it, and it's not the first stop I'd go for pizza."
"I called 5 minutes before I arrived with small kids and told there was no wait. After parking and walking in I was told it was a 30 minute wait. The only excuse I got from the front desk was that someone else answered the phone and didn't ask them about wait times. I thought this was a show of bad service. I have eaten here before and food is typically good so I gave it two stars. Came back another time. Wait for 30 minutes for a table which I knew about and was fine but pizza wait is another 60 minutes after you sit which seems crazy. After sitting and waiting 30 minutes, was told that pizza wait is now up to 90 minutes. Pizza came and was under cooked and definitely not worth my 2 hour wait. Downgrading to one star."
"I am so disappointed. Pequod's is one of my favorite deep dish pizzas. But they totally disappointed us tonight. My husband calls and orders for pick up a large sausage and onion pizza. They say it'll take an 1.5 hour. Ok, we'll do it because we want pequods. Husband gets there a little earlier, gets the pizza, and IT'S THE WRONG ORDER. They tell him to make a new one would take another 45 mins. He decides to just take the wrong pizza cause it's past 9pm and we're hungry. They give him a gift card and he leaves.We are now eating cold pizza at 9:35pm.I checked the balance on the gift card. It had a previous balance of $25. It now has $5. Terrible customer service."
"1 hour wait, 98% bread, 1 percent sauce, 1 percent cheese. If that's what you're into, then by all means, you know where to go."
"Not my choice. Was looking at comparing Chicago style pizzas and this was so bready, like Pizza Hut deep dish on steroids. Flavor was good but we got extra cheese and I was just scraping the topping to eat with a smidge of the crust. Won't go back! Think Giordanos and Lou's is hands down better!"
"""Give it 20 minutes.""""It will be out in 20 more minutes""We were given promises from our waitress that the pizzas would be out in twenty minutes, but as a period of twenty minutes passed, we got nothing but another 20-minute promise. After multiple 20-minute promises, we have been sitting for nearly two hours with all our water cups empty, still pizza-less, in the hot AC-less environment. Our head of the party finally had enough and demanded to speak to the manager. When the manager came, he curtly asked, ""Okay, who is going to yell me?"" Fortunately, our head of the party was an assertive man and made that manager know that we were angry at the endless wait. The manager went to see the situation and informed us what we have long suspected: our order was forgotten. He apologized to us, demanded our waitress to fill our water cups and send out more appetizers, and promised twenty more minutes.An hour after speaking to the manager, the pan pizzas finally arrived. Admittedly, the pizza was delicious but it was too late at that point because it was not worth the three-hour ordeal."
"I love pizza and have been a Chicagoan all my life. Naturally, I was excited to try Pequod's pan pizza after hearing so much about it and reading the reviews. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. I had the pan pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. The overall flavor was BLAND. I found myself using the salt, pepper, and red pepper shakers more than at other restaurant I've visited. I agree that the caramelized cheese crust was good, but not worth the trip or the money I spent on the entire pizza. Additionally, the bread was too hard and flavorless. With all the great reviews, I'm left wondering if I missed something. Am I the only one with this experience? I don't understand all the accolades."
"I'm writing this in hopes that someone from ownership or upper managment sees it and can talk some sense into their management team......I ordered a large pizza for deliver and I ordered half pepperoni and half veggies (because of dietary restrictions) When the pizza arrived, there was only 2 slices that did not have meat on it. This was obviously an error on the pizza makers part, but mistakes happen. I called to see what we could do to fix the situation the manager over the phone was (and still is) a complete jackass! He said ""That just means some pepperonis laid to the side while in transit & we don't guarantee our half doers to actually be half""Really? That is the worst attitude and approach you could take to this situation. I work in the restaurant industry and have done so for the past 6 years. I have managed, served, bar backed, hosted, etc......I can't even wrap my head around how ownership can allow this manager to talk to his guests the way he did. I certainly understand that mistakes happen, but the way this was handled was absolutely terrible. Losing me as a customer, I'm sure will not effect your business at all, but if you keep up this attitude, I promise you sill start to see a significant decrease in sales. PLENTY of other delicious pizza available. Good riddanceUPDATE: Someone from management (Sean) reached out to me and offered his help in coming to a resolution. When I proposed a fair resolution- He did the most un professional thing possible and IGNORED AND DID NOT RESPOND, after HE INITIATED A RESOLUTION....."
I have been here a number of times.  The pizza is good.  We went to see Star Wars across the street.  This restaurant is what PRINTING  money looks like.  2600 yelp reviews.  The place is a filthy dump.  The waitstaff really hustles.  I will probably be back. Happy 2016
"Since when doesn't this place take reservations but preferred line status only?  Would of been Better to find out before actually going there, but thankful Bartoli's is not too far away, has a small seating area that was open, and quick 30 minute deep dish order was done promptl before our movie time. Pequods has been more of a disappointment than a blessing the last few visits, so a thumbs up to trying Bartoli's location vs just quality delivery. Chicago Mag was not wrong with the past years pizza ranking, there is a ton of new players in town that appreciate your business and mine. Last thing, Pequods bacon is Canadian, so not TRUE bacon, buyer beware."
"I was in town for the weekend and wanted to take my family and girlfriend here for their 1st time. We arrived early in the evening and were told that there would be a 45 min-1 hour wait. We were staying downtown and it was a bit of a trek to get out there, so we were willing to wait. We went next door for a drinks. After waiting our hour we decided to check in, expecting to be told we would be seated shortly, and were told that it would be another hour b/c people were watching the Blackhawks.I'm a Blackhawks fan, but this was still the preseason!If they are truly one of the top pizza destinations in the city, do they really want their clientele to treat the place like a sports bar for a pre-season hockey game?"
"Pequods, you SUCK. YOU SUCK!!!!!Came here with my in laws hoping to get them some good deep dish. We were quoted one hour to an hour and a half. Two hours later, still waiting, the host and manager informed us that people calling ahead were getting bumped up ahead of us, and that it would be another hour. No apology, no offer for some water, nothing, just you're shit out of luck if you arrive and put your name in. We wasted over two hours (and two cab rides) of our night waiting to not be served. Just be honest from the start that it's going to be at longer wait that's quoted, and that we aren't a priority. That is not how you treat people at all. No thank you. We will never be back and will bad mouth this place to everyone we know. Screw you pequods."
"I would've loved to say it was great pizza, but they cancelled my delivery order.  I've never heard of a pizza place cancel your order 2 hours before it needed to delivered... on a Tuesday."
"I recently went in for my husbands birthday.  The pizza was totally disappointing - I don't know if they've changed the recipe or what, but it was just bland and totally boring.  The crust is still yummy, but the cheese and sauce where just totally boring.  I used to LOVE this pizza!  What changed?Also, WTF is the deal with the seating policy there?  You ask for one of many, many available booths and they insist on seating you at a table.  In a huge restaurant...on a Wednesday night...at 5:30pm.  Bad call, and literally every single one of the 4+ couples that followed us in that evening complained about being forced to seat at the tables when there were open booths - and like us, they all just changed over to the booths.  It's a stupid policy, guys, makes it looks like you only value the large groups...and whoever made up it up needs to be force-fed their flavorless tomato sauce until he explodes."
"This is a review of my takeout experience. I was stopping through Chicago on my way home to NC. I decided to pick up a deep dish pizza as a birthday present to myself and went to Pequod's on a friend's recommendation. I had two hours which was just enough because traffic was terrible! I was very excited about the caramelized crust because in my experience, caramelized = delicious. I picked up my pizza which was finished on time. So far, so good. 3 hours later, I get to the airport and finally have some time to try a slice. The crust looks thickly blackened. I try it. It doesn't taste very good, it's extremely dry and very hard to chew through (I have great teeth).I call the restaurant to see if something went wrong. I ask to speak with the manager and cordially explain the whole situation. He was nice about it, maybe with a hint of condescension, and told me that it was supposed to be like that. I express skepticism, because I like all food (I am Chinese and we really do eat everything) and if there are rave reviews about the crust then something is probably not right. I ask if it could have something to do with the fact that I'm eating it hours later and he counters no way. He refused to concede at all and maintained as long as the bottom isn't burnt, then it means the crust couldn't be anything but perfect. Being that I was with my pizza and he wasn't, I'm not sure how he could guarantee that. He said, and I quote, ""Nothing went wrong in the kitchens today."" I'm not sure what that means in terms of my pizza. There were no kitchen fires? Anyway, I quickly became annoyed with his attitude as he seemed 100% unable to admit to the possibility that the pizza was not as it should have been. It's not like I would have been able to ask for a refund at that point...I just wanted some semblance of sympathy or offering of remorse!I did receive some unexpected consolation: a pastor waiting for the flight in the aisle across from me completely sympathized with me and gave me a nice pamphlet about Jesus. In his words, ""I thought there was something wrong with your crust the moment you opened it up.""I'm attaching a picture of my crust. The thickness of the black part averages about 4 millimeters. Two stars because my pizza was still warm after a couple hours! They wrap it in tinfoil for extra insulation and the box has extra latches so it couldn't open by itself accidentally. Very useful for a traveler.At home, I microwaved a slice that seemed like its crust actually had the right amount of blackness, maybe 1mm (unlike the majority of the pizza) and it was not bad at all. I wish the entire pizza had been like that!"
"Horrible customer service. The horrible women taking my order hates her job. Yelled at me and hung up on me. Horrible service for a supposed chicago establishment. If they don't care of staff training, they don't care about the guests. Arrogant place. Never again."
I wasn't impressed with the deep dish pizza. I ordered a small deep dish with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was too bready and dry from the lack of tomato sauce. It wasn't very cheesy either. The caramelized crust tasted burnt. It was edible but I wouldn't order it again.The cheesy Garlic bread I ordered as an appetizer was way better than the deep dish pizza.The wait for a table was about 30min on a Friday night for 2.
Not for me. The toppings were good but put on top of thick stale bread. The worst crust I have ever had. I honestly don't understand the line outside this place. And the burning thing? That just tastes like burnt cheese taffy. Lol Well to each his own. This pizza or pizza bread (stale) is not for me.
"Worst delivery experience I have ever had! I would and will not be recommending this place to anyone. They are very unprofessional. I ordered a soup and salad combo. The delivery guy only brought the soup. Once I realized I quickly called the restaurant to let them know they had forgotten the salad. The phone girl was not helpful at all. She told us that if we wanted our salad it would be an additional hour wait to the hour that we had just waited for our food to be delivered. We asked her if there was anything she could do to speed up the process as this was not our fault, we paid our bill and tipped the delivery guy. She told us no and that we needed to wait an hour which tells us they hadn't even made the salad in the first place. I will never be eating here again. If I could give this place -1 stars I would! And I would not recommend this place to anyone as they are highly unprofessional in customer service."
"We opted for delivery and were severely disappointed. The deep dish consisted of 90% crust and very little cheese. To top it off, the crust was burned to a crisp. I love pizza, and am really not that picky when it comes down to it, but after picking off over half of the crust of my first slice, I didn't even bother going back for another. Needless to say, I wouldn't order from here again."
The only way that I would go back is to see if it was as better than the first and if it was free. This was not as good as I hoped. It was disappointing as the crust was burnt which is the best part. It was low on said sauce so make sure you ask for extra sauce. I was told this is better than my favorite Lou Malnotti's and it wasn't even close. Decent taste but no way top 5 deep dish!
I''m not really sure what the fuss is about.  The pizza wasn't anything special and there was an hour wait for our reservation (that they lost).  This place is so busy it will give even those with the calmest demeanor an anxiety attack.  I just don't get it.  I just don't.
"Did not meet expectations. Sauce was bland, not nearly enough sausage, crust was burnt, and minimal taste. I don't really get the hype, but the fried mushrooms were very good. Probably will not be coming back, there are better options out there for Chicago style pizza."
"I am not sure what happened to this place. We used to always order from here Bc it was amazing. Being on a strict diet lately, I haven't ordered pizza in awhile. I decided to splurge and ordered a deep dish pepperoni. I can not even describe how awful it was. I have lived in this city 15 years and never had deep dish this bad. The dough tasted stale. It was so soggy that it was following apart. The pepperoni did not taste the same. The sauce tasted like a can of unseasoned tomato sauce. I could not even eat it. Had a half of piece. And of course the best part, as every reviewer complains about, was that I waited 1.5 hours for this dog food. I will absolutely never order from here again. Lou Malnatis is the best and pequods is not even near the same level as their deep dish. Save yourself the headache and order from Lous"
"Ordered pizza for delivery here in late November and it arrived lukewarm after about an hour. Cheese wasn't very melted and it seemed they had rushed out the order late as if it had been forgotten. We called to complain and they agreed to give us a discount on a future order, not to refund any portion of the order that was undercooked. We reluctantly ate what came because we couldn't wait another hour. Too bad, really, because this place has been a neighborhood favorite for years. But after this experience we won't be coming back. Too many other good pizza places around."
"I've given up. Been going to Pequods for a bit over a decade. When they're at their best, they are the best. Unfortunately, that rarely happens anymore. Even when they are on top of their game, expect to devote about half of your night waiting for it. Their service started to decline about 3-4 years ago. When I talk about Pequods with people now, a certain waitress always pops up. We call her ""waitress no response"". Here's one of my experiences with her (of many): Pizza arrives not correct, not the right toppings and hard as a brick from overcooking. She comes back to check on us and I explain how the pizza is inedible. She looks blankly at us, does a 180, and walks away. We had to track down the manager ourselves, who says the server is just too busy to deal with it (seriously!). Doesn't offer any sympathy, let alone comping, and gets annoyed when we ask for a new pizza.This was about 2 years ago and the quality of service has not improved. I gave them a chance (have still gone probably once a month on average since), but I have to move on. I have way more positive things to say about this place and their sporadically good pizza. Unfortunately, none of them are from he last 3-4 years.That brings me to quality of food. It used to be that we knew exactly what we would get when we ordered and it would be delicious. Lately, we've been lucky if it's edible. I had the manager tell me that being able to pick apart individual strands of non melted cheese was their style... When I told them I've been eating there for years and the pizza was obviously not cooked enough, I got an eye roll. I didn't even ask for a new pizza, just to finish cooking it!I'd much rather eat a decent enough deep dish, that doesn't take forever with terrible service, somewhere else. Open more chains or something, hire better staff and managers! I love you Pequods! Until you change though, I won't even go to use up a gift card.."
not even close to #1 I prefer Giordano's looks good but it is ok..too much dough for the dough.
"let's talk about the most over-hyped pizza place, shall we? They get props for the bruschetta, which was quite simple but tasty. They got props that we were immediately. Props stop here.Ambiance is typical for a Chicago neighborhood establishment..no big deal. What's the big deal about their ""caramelized crust?"" The pizza is a mediocre interpretation of what Chicago style pan pizza should be. The service was lackluster at best..nobody seemed to care..if I can describe the service as food, it tasted like peqoud's pizza..see what I did there?Overall the best way to describe this place is hype..it has nothing else."
"I have been hearing about this place for a while and everyone raves about it, so I was excited to try it. And let me tell you, OMG was it a letdown. I don't know if it was over-hyped or what but I didn't think the pizza was that good. I will start with the crust, it was too soft. Sorry! I don't like that melty soft crust. The sausage was good but I don't know, it was just missing something. I can't figure out what it was.  I tried the deep dish and it just lacked. We got leftovers, which were accidently left in my car over night. When I got in the car the next morning I realized because my car smelled of garlic. I just threw the leftovers out, I wasn't going to eat it anyways.I'm sure I will be back, cause the girlfriend loves this place. But I would still rather go to Lou's or Gino's. The deep dish at those places, is just superior."
"Why do people love this place? After waiting WAY too long for our thin crust sausage pizza, something dry and with meatballs (I think) was delivered to our table. Is this what they use as sausage? This place was just gross on all levels: terrible food, an overmatched staff, not the best/cleanest digs, etc. The only thing it has going for it is that it is open late and is in a great location. Otherwise, this is probably the worst pizza I've ever had. Avoid--especially in a pizza town such as Chicago."
"Given how hyped this place is as the best pizza in town, I was incredibly disappointed!  The crust was incredibly bland, and to me, that's a mood killer for deep dish.  There was some cheese burnt around the edges of it that was delicious, but 5% great doesn't make up for 95% boring.  Add in absurdly late delivery and I just can't justify giving it another try."
Pizza is good but the place is a cluster. Made an order for pick up and was told it'd be ready by 6:15p. Got there at 6:30p and it took them over 45 minutes to transact the payment and retrieve my pizza from the back.Not worth the hassle and trying to find a place to stand while you wait.
"Not going to lie, my experience here was disappointing... the waitress was extremely rude and ruined the experience. The pizza was not very delicious, I don't know much about Chicago deep dish but the crust was dry and it wasn't very flavorful. If you want a good Chicago deep dish pizza do not go here"
"Wow, what a rude order taker!First I ask, do you deliver to Lake Point Tower?No, we don't! (all her responses were very snappy)But your delivery zone map looks like it is right by u.....What's your address?505 N Lake Shore Drive, but you......What's your phone number?312- XXX - XXXXWhat's your name?A......Hold on...What's your [street?] number?(slowly this time) 5-0-5 N Lake...I already got that!  What's your Suite number?1XXX (we never call it a suite)K, waddya want?14 inch pan with sausage mushroom green pepperAnything else?NoCash or charge?Cash.  How much?Whatever she said I don't remember I was so upset.  33 or 34 somethingHour to an hour and a halfokWow it's 5:25 on a Thursday!  90 minutes?  We shall see...Arrived 7:05PMToo cold for our liking.  Why did it take 100 minutes for delivery?We heated it in the oven a bit, but that still didn't help much.Our crust was not ''caramelized'' around the edges, but more like burnt.  The bottom of the crust was soggy.  By the way this is not a stuffed pizza, it is a thick crust pizza.  A stuffed pizza is a pie shell filled with cheese and toppings, covered by another layer of crust, and then sauce put on top.  Compare with Edwardo's.I must also say that the toppings are not evenly distributed, particularly the sausage.  I got one large chunk that I cut up to try to distribute myself on my piece.  And there was a smaller one stuck in the burnt ''caramelized'' section.  Nice hunks of green pepper though, and a few red ones thrown in for I don't know what reason.  Hard to see any mushrooms though.The bites of sausage were quite spicy, but otherwise it tasted pretty bland, and I didn't enjoy the texture (burnt edges and soggy bottom).  Along with a rude employee that is the face of the business by answering the phone, I wonder how this got in that article of the 50 best foods to try in Chicago.  I crossed this off the list, and the author of that article owes me $35."
"Not really sure what the excitement is about. First time I had it we got the thin crust (1st mistake) and it was not even close to good. The second time I had it we ordered 2 of the pan pizzas - they were good but there is way too much crust and way too much sauce with very little toppings. The sauce helped the pizza not taste too dry, but I've still had better. Not worth the wait."
"Never eating here again due to poor customer service and a ridiculous wait. I had relatives in town and I called ahead to put my name on the ""list"" since they don't accept reservations. When we arrived, they said it was a 60 minute wait. Went up to the hostess at that time and they said it'd be another 45 minute wait. So we waited because at that point, we had already invested a lot of time. Went back to the hostess and there still wasn't any seating, and on top of that the pizza would take another 30 minutes to make even after we got seated, so we left. The pizza isn't worth the hassle, I'd choose giordanos over pequods any day."
"Horrible, if you want a piece of bread with a millimeter of cheese on top then this is your place!  When you open the pizza it looks great but don't be deceived.. Been a customer for a decade and it's a shame to write this! GDD"
I've heard a lot of hype about this place and finally got around to checking it out since I was in the area. Can't say I was pleased. I ordered a medium deep dish with jalapeños and onions and easy cheese. First thing I notice was the bread/dough was really really dry. It was fluffy but had lost literally all of its moisture. Plus they kinda started to burn the bottom. As I pushed through the second slice I noticed the sauce wasn't that sweet and was heavy in some spice/seasoning that that began to make it overwhelming and I barely finished. I started to feel sick because of this and all of the water I had to drink to counter the dry bread. Best thing I could say was the jalapeños were spicy. Service was okay but since we didn't order much we rarely saw the waitress. But it was also busy so that could be why.Can't say I'll recommend this place. Lou Malnati's in my opinion still has the best deep dish pizza in the city. Hell the frozen Roundry's pizza I got from Mariano's was better. But that's just my two cents and I'm sure others will totally disagree with me. I just can't say I'd understand their point of view.
"First time there and will never be back!!!  Waited nearly 2 hours to be seated and another hour forty five for a cheese and sausage pizza, which by the way was nothing  special at all!!!!!  A party of 8 which ordered nearly twenty minutes after us had their pizzas and were leaving before we even got ours.  Our waitress Kaylee and the manager had nothing but excuses rather than a simple apology.  The place was dark and dirty.  If you want a really good pizza, try Palermo's 95th or Gino's on Superior.  I'll be sure to spread the word to everyone I know.  By the way, this place doesn't even deserve one star!!!!"
"Pizza is okay, but I would never dine in here again. We ordered takeout because of the line, and when it arrived they said we could eat at the bar.As soon as we sat down, the bartender decided that because we came from takeout we weren't going to order anything and weren't worth a second of her time. No waters, no napkins, no utensils, she didn't care to spend one second. Disgraceful. Too bad, we actually DID want beers.The lady at the takeout register took care of us (when it was obviously not her job), and I made sure to put the tip in her hands."
"Pequod's has excellent pizza with the caramelized crust. A big fan of the pizza.They do need to work on training their staff when you dine in the restaurant.We ordered a large Chicago Style Pizza with Onions, Pepperoni and Mushrooms. After having salad and waiting 45 minutes our pizza arrived with Onions, Sausage and Mushrooms. We told the server and she confirmed the ticket was given correctly but the kitchen screwed it up. (not sure how).  We told her we would just go ahead and eat it instead of waiting. (I don't particularly like sausage on pizza) We got our bill and nothing was taken off. Could have just taken off our drinks (2 ice teas) or the salad perhaps but even the $3 for the meat would have been fine. Or even an offer of a free dessert - We would have declined.I e-mailed Pequod's and didn't name our server (didn't want to get her in trouble) but just let them know this was not my expectation when their kitchen makes a mistake. I received no reply. I love the Pizza but think this place needs some training on making their customers seem valued."
"Really disappointed. Maybe the pan pizza is better - we ordered two slices of the cheese thin crust, a salad, cheesy garlic bread and two bowls of soup. The cheesy garlic bread was okay - but they give you the smallest side of marinara sauce which I don't understand. They ask if you want the side, so why it isn't enough to dip the two pieces in? The soup was served lukewarm at best and nothing to write home about. The cheese pizza was dry and probably the blandest I've ever tasted. We brought home one of the two pieces (still not sure why - maybe hoping it would be better cold?) and it was even worse the next day. The Pequod's salad which is said to have pepperoncini's on it had one. Yep - just one itty bitty pepperocini and the same size serving of dressing that they give you for the marinara sauce with the cheesy garlic bread. Honestly folks - the sauce and the dressing can't cost you so much that you are going to lose money by increasing the portion size. Service was mediocre - had to hunt down the waitress for a refill. Probably will never go back."
I had VERY high hopes for this place!!The yelp reviews were so high that I just KNEW this was going to be a homerun in the pizzeria arena! Buuuuttt--- NOPE!The mozz sticks were great.The pizza on the other hand- not so great. The sauce was horrible- no flavor.The cheese on the pizza was great-- very cheesy. When I am in the mood for pizza-- I will stick to my usual--- UNO!I only ate a few slices of pizza before paying for it and abandoning the pizza.
"I had been to the Morton Grove location many years ago, it was my favorite pizza!  I stopped in the clybourn location a few days ago, and it was ""meh"".  The pizza was definitely undercooked, and the crust was beyond soggy, and bland.  Usually I would keep the leftovers, even if it wasn't a great pizza, but this one went directly into the trash.  Who would have thought?"
"I don't really understand the hype for this place. We went there today as part of a pizza tour. The tour guide hyped it up as being amazing, an institution, a classic, etc....and I gotta say I was REALLY not impressed. The pizza was super ""bready"". Tough to accurately describe but basically tasted like a somewhat dry dinner roll with some melted cheese and sauce on top. It just really didn't work for me. I've had Chicago style deep dish pies elsewhere, such as Lou Malnati's, that blow the doors off of this place. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it's just not for me. But I found it really disappointing."
"I want to start by saying the food is great - this review is specifically about our server, who on the check had her name as PP. (The busser said her name was either Katie or Kelly, but he was pretty unsure) - She had the worst service for us. She wasn't very attentive and did not care to refill our waters/sodas, give us napkins, or ask how we were doing; In conclusion she genuinely just did not care about us. She was not friendly. It was odd because she did appear to care a lot more about her other tables in her section. For every 3 times she went up to another table, she only came to us once after we had to flag her down. My group of 7 was very unimpressed with the service, and did not tip her at all."
"Very bad services. Serve with not a very good attitude. NEVER try their pasta or Spagetthi, it's very watery. Ordered a drink but the drink never come until we asked. Asked to put in the chair ourselves and doesn't know what to recommend."
"I have an open stomach that does not discriminate... but my first Chicago deep dish greatly disappoints. It was 1.5inch breading and a thin layer of cheese. The sausage one wasn't too bad since it did taste like an italian sausage pizza but the amount of carb to meat ratio was so very off. I have to agree with the other reviewers: the crusty crust that is slightly burnt makes the pizza. It was the most enjoyable part of the deep dish... which isn't saying much. I'm sure this restaurant makes other delicious items but on the deep dish alone I will not be enjoying that again until a later time.The restaurant itself looks hipster on the outside, backwater country bar on the inside. Dim lighting, tvs around. It is a bit of wait to get the pizza as well, ours was 30minutes.TLDR: NY style pizza is still the best pizza."
2nd time trying ..... 1 hour and 30 mins still no pizza. It's with the driver and could be another 20 mins according to the woman who answered the phone. No thanks. No pizza in Chicago is good after being In the car for 20 mins +. We were trying again for Father's Day but this will be our last try.
Lou Malnattis if by far better and not as burntI see all the high rating on here.  LITERALLY ya'll must've been high and hungry as hell to rate burnt ass pizza high as hell
What is all the rave about?? The deep dish is sub-par. It's very doughy and the place is packed with usually rude costumes. Sorry to all my Pequod loving friends out there.
"Worst service I've ever had! I used to be a server for years so I am very understanding. We had a reservation for 6:30 and they told us it would be a half hour wait! Then after an hour and 25 minutes we asked to order our pizza at the bar till we got our table. They refused and ""said"" we were the next table. I asked to speak to the manager and he was so rude to my friend. He even said, ""you need to take your friend out of here."" I have never experienced such horrible service. Be honest with your costumers and kind when you totally mess up and lie :("
"Deep dish pizza? No, cornbread with a dash of sauce and toppings is more accurate. I'm amazed at how hyped this place is, I came into town expecting the best deep dish! I was severely disappointed. I think the ingredients were great, but the ratios totally off! The pizza was 80% bread! Fine, you made A pizza in a deep dish..but definitely not the best. Pequod's sits at the bottom of my list of pizzerias to revisit.Maybe this is the deep dish some like, but I haven't seen anything like this. Usually they're piled deep cheese, lots of ingredients and lots of sauce, not crust!"
"Deep dish is one thing...a loaf of bread with a bit of sauce and toppings on top is another. I was excited to try this place, but I'll likely never return. I guess technically the dish is deep, it just happens to be filled with 80% dough, boring dough."
"I know they get great reviews, so I had to try it finally.  Edwardo's is still my favorite.  Not a fan AT ALL of the ""burnt pizza"" craze.  Cardboard crust just wasn't for me. Didn't help that it was a veryyyy long wait and they messed up the order, when you say that you really hate a certain topping and they put that topping in the pizza, not good!"
"Let me start this off with I really love their pizza.  However, I'm really sick of getting crappy service.  I just called to inquire about a reservation (on the yelp page it says they accept reservations) and I dealt with a very snooty hostess (If I describe her attitude in a more realistic way, I don't think yelp would be allowed to post my review).You may have great tasting pizza, but Chicago has a lot of great pizza, and I will NOT put up with rude people, especially when their job is related to customer service. Bad form!"
We called and made reservations tonight for 7:30pm. We arrive and were told it would be an hour. When we reiterated we had reservations the hostess explained that it cut our wait time down from two hours to one. What kind of system is that?! There is a sign that says pizza wait time is 75 min from the time you order. So with a reservation we can expect to eat in two hours and fifteen minutes! This is some serious BS.
"While the pizza is average, the service & management are deplorable. If you're looking for Chicago deep dish - choose Lou Malnati's."
"I have no idea why this has gotten so much hype. It's average pizza, nothing more, nothing less. If you're in the area and have no other options, this place does the trick. Otherwise, Chicago has much better to offer."
"The deep dish pizza here tastes like lies. I promised my family from out of town that this was the best deep dish pizza in town because it was voted online. It was far from it. Delivery took two hours in town. Pizza tasted like a beer biscuit. It was almost entirely dough, not enough cheese although we ordered extra cheese."
"After all the hype - pretty disappointing.  Been hearing about this place for years, I was expecting to be blown away - like my first bite of Lou's. The in-restaurant experience may be better but the take-home show was quite awful as far as the crust goes.  We had these lovely toppings....mushrooms, onions,  huge hunks of sausage - but when we got it home (a 5 minute drive)  it was just a pile of tasty ingredients displayed a top a warmish sponge."
"Just... nope, can't eat here again. And it IS the pizza for me. The pizza dough is SO dense and bready so there needs to be a lot more sauce if they're not going change the recipe. That, or quit over-kneading it. As a Chicagoan raised on Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, Pequod's doesn't compare to them. Sorry... =\"
I felt the need to come back (heartbroken) to talk about my uneventful delivery order. Ordered the usual large sausage pizza. We added hot wings and mozzarella sticks this time to change it up. Pizza - soggyMozzarella sticks- soggy and coldHit wings- umm high school mystery meat? That's all I have to say. I'm bummed that my favorite pizza place seems to be lacking in the quality I like about this place. $50 down the drain.
"Let me tell you I was so excited to finally try the pizza my family raves about all the time. Unfortunately, right when I entered I waited 5-10 minutes at the door when the bartender and the host were talking. I was seated after with no menu and had to get up to ask for one. Server took 20 minutes to approach my table and another 20 min for a glass of water. Our appetizers arrived and our sample platter was undercooked. The batter was soggy from the inside and the mushrooms were dried out. The two tables after us had gotten their pizza and my table was still waiting. The pizza arrives after an hour of waiting on a slow Monday night and it was wrong. I'm a vegetarian and was given a sausage mushroom pizza when I asked for half sausage and half spinach. The waitress came back and rudely said we had to wait another 45 min for another pizza and didn't offer an apology. I was I furious by this point I paid and left. I paid for horrible service and food. I called the restaurant and a lady under the name Mariah picks up, without any greeting and says ""hey"" I explained to her what happened and reads 6 different orders but my order. She says ""I can't do nothing for you you can call Thursday Shawn will be here and will fix your problem"". My server was a medium height African American woman: Save your time and money try Lou Malnati's"
"I'm not a fan of bready deep dish pizza, and Pequod's serves bready deep dish pizza. I imagine if you like bready deep dish, you would like Pequod's. I don't like bready deep dish. The place itself felt divey. Seems like it'd be a nice neighborhood spot for a few drinks. The toppings were good. That breadiness though..."
"I did not enjoy my delivery pizza. We ordered a sausage, green pepper and onion pan pizza.  I was pretty excited because my brother claims Pequod's is the best.Alas. I either caught them on a bad day, or my brother has bad taste in pizza. The presentation was awful, the sauce and crust were bland and the veggies were cut too big and were undercooked, totally watering down the pizza. My brother reckons if I'd skipped the veg I'd have had a better experience. However, given the blandness of the sauce and crust, I am not so sure about that."
"I'm honestly confused why people rave about this place. I've lived in Chicago my whole life and have tried every sort of deep dish there is. This reminds me of the type of deep dish you'd get elsewhere in the country (you know, the fake kind). In a city with Lous, Ginos, and Uno/Due, this is probably the last place I would recommend going to."
Nope. It's fine. But that's it. There are maaaaaany better deep dish places out there.
For one i do not like pizza. Theyre pizza is nothing fabulous. Staff isnt that great. Cesaer salad was average and a bit warm. Garlic cheese bread i could do with out. They have good marinara sauce for the mozz sticks that are good. I love their ginger ale pop though. Never want to come here again. Place was really cute and nice though. Set up a bit odd. They have a bathroom thats coed and then a girl n guys bathroom. They have a bar as well. Downstairs n upstairs seating with tvs. Place is kinda big.all of our plates though were cracked.
"I have to agree with another reviewer that the reviews of this place have to be inflated or fake.  I finally ordered from Pequod's and I cannot believe how tasteless the pizza is.  I ordered 2 pizzas and a pan pizza to make a decent judgment call and my family and I could not get past one piece.  This is nothing but bland bread with thick ragu and some cheese.  The pan pizza was just thicker bread with more ragu and burnt cheese!  One of our pizza's had sausage, we honestly thought they were more like meatballs and again.....tasteless!!  There are hundreds of small pizza places in a 5 mile radius of this place that know how to make a knock out pizza that represents what pizza is supposed to be......go there and skip this.  I now understand why there is always a line....it's dirt cheap.....if it were expensive they would have closed years ago."
"Items ordered include:Medium Pan - Half SausageMedium Thin - Half BasilFor our third stop of the night it was decided we should finally pay a visit to Pequod's, a space formerly helmed by Burt Katz, where many claim the best deep dish pizza in the city can be found and although I cannot disagree that this is the best deep dish I've experienced within city limits I most certainly can say I would much rather drive out to visit Burt's in Morton Grove than deal with the disorganization, noise, and hassle that is Pequod's ever again.  Beginning first with a forty-five minute wait just to obtain a seat and progressing to a nearly thirty minute wait before ordering followed by a deafening hour-long delay before our pies would arrive there really is not much to like about the demeanor, decibels, or décor at Pequod's and although the beautifully caramelized crust and rich, bright tomato sauce certainly outshine the flavors at Uno or even Lou Malnati's it is only to a small degree - not one worth such annoyances, and the thin crust option was actually quite dismal - a limp pie with a doughy crust that could just as easily be made from a box at home."
"The pizza tastes good but the customer service is terrible. According to the Peaquods website we live in the delivery area. When we ordered pizza today, however, we received a call 10 minutes later cancelling our order and telling us that we are outside the delivery area. We pointed out to a manager that on the web site where they map out the delivery area, we are clearly in the zone. But the manager didn't care. Very frustrating. Sad that we won't ever order from here again."
"Great pizza, but apparently an 8 pm reservation means maybe by 9 and pizza by 10:15. Fine, you're busy, but tell us the truth of the situation so we don't waste our time not getting a table on a Friday night."
"I am on vacation in Chicago and went yesterday. What a mistake!My friend/host during this trip called ahead and made a ""priority seating"" arrangement for our four person party for 7pm. We arrived a bit early and checked in. We were told that our ""priority seating"" got us a 45 min - 1 hour wait. Uh, ok. So we go outside and wait. After 1 hour we check back in, only to be told that we have ""at least another half hour"" to wait. We're disappointed, but we wait. After half an hour, we check back in. Again, we are told that we have ""at least another half hour."" So the 45 min - 1 hour wait that we were promised turned into a 2 hour minimum wait. Ridiculous. We mulled over our options and decided to stick it out. We finally got seated around 9pm. After we were seated, three of us ordered beers and we asked the waitress about pizza ordering time (we tried to see if we could pre-order while we were outside, but were told they don't do that after 5pm on weekends). She told us that the pizza would take up to an hour and 25 minutes to arrive. Good grief.After several minutes, the waitress brings me my Blue Moon. But a lot of time goes by and my two friends' beers are nowhere to be seen. We flag down the waitress and it turns out she lost their order, so she has to retake it. Finally, the pizza arrives. I got a personal pizza with ground beef, mushrooms, and garlic. Just FYI, some people will tell you the pan crust is deep dish, but it is not. The ground beef was under seasoned (actually, the pizza as a whole was, come to think of it) and there's not enough cheese on it. I had to keep adding parmesan and oregano. All in all, horrible experience. Spent nearly 4 hours on eating mediocre pizza. I will never come back and I'm going to make sure to tell other visiting friends to stay away!"
"This place is so overrated.  Who likes burnt pizza?  I have never eaten in, only had delivery.  But there is way better pizza in Chicago."
"What an absolute let down. I go to Chicago often for work and a good friend always kept pushing Pequods. I finally relented and what a disappointment.First I did order delivery- and that was a part of the issue. Was given a 90 minute time frame, arrived in 105 mins. Got upstairs opened it up and it's the wrong pie. Ordered sausage and onions and this one is covered in pineapple.I call and after an apology and am offered store credit (really? No refund) or a new pie. I take the pizza and given a 40 minute time frame or sooner I'm told.Hour goes by, I call and am told its on the way. Finally shows up after 75 minute wait. Yes I waited over three hours for my pizza.Opened all excited, looks great, but it's just not good. Tomato sauce tastes cheap, crust is soft, the whole thing is a mess. Will never go back. I recommend you go elsewhere as well.Update-- Pequods emailed me an apology and saying they will work to ensure that issue doesn't happen to anyone else again. Much appreciated Pequods- makes me want to give them another shot, however it will be dine- in this time!!"
Great food but staffs attention to a health code issue was just embarrassing. A vent covered in condensation dropped into our food & drinks. We stood up on top of the booth 3x to wipe it dry ourselves.
Omg I was referred to this pizzaria the pizza was not good at all they use phony pepperoni and their pizza sauce is to sweet.i just didn't care for it I had way much better pizza.
"I've been coming here for decades and this was the first time I was completely disappointed.   An inch of dust on everything,  an apathetic staff, and food not up to par.  My pizza was just shy of being completely cooked.  My salad came out at the same time as the pizza but without any dressing.   One person got a pasta dish - a whopping one tablespoon of sauce and the bottom half of the bowl was full of water because the pasta was not not drained.  It was so bad I will try the suburban location for the first time next time I have a taste for pizza."
"My husband and I visited Pequod's last weekend - we had heard so much about Pequod's, we took a long train ride for our evening out.1) Our waitress was lack-luster, disinterested in helping people - never asked how everything was and we had to get her attention to order another cocktail....it seems as though we were bothering her.2) The pizza crust was tasteless and the amount of toppings was laughable.    We ordered a large 1/2 meatball & 1/2 sausage - there were 4 small pieces of sausage on the pizza. 3) Charging $7.95 for a small glass of rum & coke is insane - we were not in NYC...And just to be fair - we did not visit Pequod's during a dinner 'rush' - it was 4:30pm...no reason for bad service and less than adequate pizza.  It's pretty sad when I say our salad might have been the only good thing we ate."
"4 stars for pizza, 0 stars for service. I've ordered delivery several times and today was the first day I visited the restaurant. What a bummer. When out of towners ask for my opinion on ""Chicago-style"" pizza, I always say Pequods. I'll have to find a new place to recommend from now on. Seriously...the service was just that bad."
"Their pizza may be fantastic, but I'll never know. After taking the kids on their first trip to Chicago, we decided to treat them to a real deep dish pie. Pequod's treated us to a twenty five minute fifteen minute wait. We walked in before the dinner rush with most tables empty, by the time we determined they didn't want our money, they had seated several two tops, three three tops, and the final straw, a four top which pushed two tables together that we could have occupied with our five people. Shame that they are so focused on being an institution instead of a restaurant."
Waited 30-45 minutes never got paged so went inside and was told I would be seated next and they proceeded to seat a table of 6 and one before me and the manager didn't seem to care at all
"Pequod's is a Chicago staple, no doubt, however, nothing is worth the terrible experience we had the last time we dined (or didn't dine) there. Our family timed our trip to Pequod's extremely conservatively arriving at 5:00 knowing we had a 7:10 movie to see. We had already taken advantage of their priority seating service. Upon arriving we were told we could sit immediately, and as we proceeded to the table --- oh no. Just kidding.--- they decided to give our table to another family who needed a high chair, so then we continued to wait. We got seated at 5:10 and ordered two thin crust pizzas immediately due to the 60 minute wait time on pizzas they advertised at the front desk. We put in beverage orders and waited quite a while for them to come to the table, but seeing as how crowded the restaurant was, that didn't bother us. 60 minutes in to our wait time- waitress is no where to be found, table next to us had decided to leave because they had been waiting longer than they deemed appropriate for their food. 70 minutes into our wait time- still no food. Waitress arrives and alerted us it would take 10 more minutes.  We start our stop watch 80 minutes into our wait time- ""just a little longer guys."" Stressed our waitress. At 6:55 pm our waitress comes by with to-go boxes, knowing we had a movie to catch, and said we still needed to wait on the pizza. At that point, we paid for our drinks, and in a last minute attempt to eat dinner opted for potbellys sandwiches next door. We know this wasn't the waitress' fault. She already lost two tables that night and I felt for her. Dear Pequod's, Chicago is known for their pizza. I can think of several places that we could have gone and had a delicious pizza. If you want to stay competitive, I would suggest another way of functioning, because making people wait 1:45 minutes for a pizza is absurd. On top of that, we were sat right by the door, and your crowd control needs attention as well. I had the elbows of patrons on my chair as I'm trying to sit and converse with my family. I am extremely disappointed in my experience at your restaurant, and would feel terrible if I recommended this experience to anyone."
"Very disappointed with the pizza. From the way other yelpers describe it I went in thinking this would be the pinnacle of chicago style deep dish. Sadly what i recieved after an hour wait was equivalent to a greasy crouton with a thin flavorless layer of tomato sauce and an even thinner layer of cheese. If i had been blindfolded and fed this, I'd assume it was an overcooked breadstick. Honestly I've had better pizza from Domino's. If this is what chicago style pizza is really like, I wasn't missing out on much."
Come on !!!!! The special lunch is just for dine in !!! I don't like that.............
"First time and we were seated fairly quickly and got some cheesy bread to start.  Then we waited over an hour for one pizza to arrive the table.  The waitress was not attentive and we had to draw her to the table to get drink refills over the long wait.  Don't know if they were short staffed in the kitchen, but the wait too long."
"My fiancée and I were staying in Chicago and got hungry around 11:00 pm. We looked up delivery places in the area and this place showed up. We figured we would give it a try and get it delivered to our hotel. Horrible idea! We placed the order at 11:25 pm. We ordered a meatball sandwich, half order of wings, mozzarella sticks, fries, and a slice of cake The food didn't arrive until almost 1:00 am. Here is the worst part, they completely forgot the meatball sandwich! No sandwich at all. We called back and we were offered a ""partial refund"" not even sure for how much yet as the refund hasn't went through on my credit card just yet. We were then told the meatball sub would be right out. It didn't arrive until 2:00 am and we had to get up at 7:00 am the next morning. In the meantime waiting we tried the rest of the food. The mozzarella sticks obviously sat for quite awhile. The fries were extremely soggy and just barely cooked. The cake had a very odd refrigerator smell to it. The only thing decent enough were the wings, but you don't get much of them.  When the meatball sub arrived the delivery guy offered us a free pineapple and jalapeño pizza because ""he couldn't deliver it"". We didn't want it but just said okay with no real intentions of eating it. We opened it up just to see and as I predicted the pizza was burnt! Basically their apology was a burnt pizza someone else didn't want. $38 for some of the worst food I have ever eaten. Absolutely horrible! I would never eat from them again even if the food was free. Just disgusting. They should of refunded the entire order. The free burnt pizza was really offensive and only annoyed me further. The worst service ever!!!Edit: I got my refund today. Only $9.16 which I guess was for the meatball sub. The way the woman over the phone made it sound was that I would be at least getting half the order refunded for their mistake. Oh well. Cheap company that I would never order from again. If you want burnt pizza and bad customer service eat here!"
Make your own pizza joint. We ordered 2 and after trying several poorly prepared toppings and burnt crust I'd never come back. However if you like a plain pizza with lack of unique style check it out :)
"People always talk about how Pequod's has awesome pizza and based on the reviews on Yelp, my boyfriend and I ordered a large pan pizza for delivery last night. I was expecting a little piece of heaven in my mouth, but it wasn't there. We ordered a large pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and green peppers for delivery. After tip, it almost came out to $40, and what a waste of $40 that was. I love the caramelized cheese on the crust and the sweet sauce, but the bread on the pizza wasn't good. It lacked seasoning and didn't taste like anything. It wasn't buttery, it wasn't salty, it wasn't... anything. In my boyfriend's words, it's like they stacked a whole bunch of tortillas on top of each other and then created a pizza with it. Maybe Pequod's isn't good for delivery. I might give this place another try, but I'll definitely dining in.. If I have another $40 to spend on a pizza."
"I don't get the hype for pequods. No cheese, and way too much dough. I get that it's deep dish but all of that bread is not necessary with no Cheese to compliment it. Just a crunchy outer crust, doughy pizza with sauce. Sorry but Lou malnatis all the way!!"
This place is overrated. The crust of pizza was hard but the toppings were legit. I heard a lot of people say top 5. I have to disagree. I had their thin crust too was okay I give that 3.5 and their wings I give a 4 star. Try it for yourself and be the judge. Also not disability friendly took me and my friends to the second floor with a open table on the main floor hostess gets a 1.0
My husband  LOVES  their personal pan pizza's -  I just was not a huge fan. I am sorry.  but you know with things  like Burgers  and  Pizza - everyone's  taste  is different.  So many people  LOVE  this place -  I must be the odd man OUT!
"I disliked everything about this place and probably more so because everyone I talked to mentioned how amazing this place was. Our server was a young college kid (like everyone else here) that must've forgotten she was waiting tables because she sat and talked another group of people for 15mins before she took our order. My beer came late and warm and my water was never filled.I don't eat meat, my other two dining mates do, and we each wanted something different from the menu, so we went with personal sizes. First, the prices are offensive. Second, I hate minced garlic from a jar and when I asked if they freshly mince or use it out of a jar, our server rolled her eyes at me and said she didn't know. I never found out the truth because she never offered to find out for us.Look at my burnt pizza: yelp.com/user_local_phot…It was super dry and the red sauce was too tart."
"I don't get the love for this place. Our pizzas lacked flavor, were terribly under-seasoned, and required a large portion of the dried Parmesan found on the table next to ours. The sauce is basically tomato sauce, which also isn't seasoned. The dough with the cheese on the side just tastes like burnt nothing. I don't understand how this is the ""best"" deep dish in Chicago?! They could honestly learn something from Little freakin' Caesar's about how to do burnt cheese crust. That's how average I find their pizza."
"First, let me say I'm going to try this place again and eat there. We got delivery today, one pan pizza and one thin. The meatball on the pan was disappointing too thinly sliced and overcooked, dried out. Not at all worth the premium price for this topping especially since there was so little of it. The caramelized crust was delicious, but there was way too much sauce for my taste. The thin crust was a soggy mess. It wasn't very thin. It wasn't crisp or chewy. Just wet, maybe just doesn't deliver well. The Italian sausage on the thin crust was actually bad - no flavor and a mushy texture. It didn't taste like Italian sausage at all. The staff on the phone and the delivery guy were so nice. Hoping it was a fluke and they were having an off day."
"I wish I could have negative stars. So disappointed that my friends visiting Chicago had to suffer the disappointment of this place. In short, service and food were so terrible. The two pizzas took an hour and a half to get onto our table. Appetizers took were spaced thirty minutes between each other.If we got her attention, the waitress forgot waters, drinks and extra place settings multiple times. She was nice but just not attentive..In the span of an hour, they messed up my salad three times? All I asked for was no dairy/gluten and even offered to just take it off myself. They insisted and came back all diff variations of cheese and crouton mixes.. In the end, we cancelled it because people were done eating.Management seemed so exasperated and talked about how they messed up our table right next to us?Above all, the pizza was terrible and bland. As hungry as we were, just couldn't stomach that crust they're famous for. It was foamy and bland. Little chunks of caramelized flavor but not enough to offset the rest.We waited to talk with management, but they were so busy and not to be seen.Currently at protein bar cuz im so hungry."
"Been here a few times since friends have wanted to go. Basically, this place is a bar that serves inconsistent pizza. Good for the 20-something crowd who don't mind having to yell their conversations because the whole place is so loud. Service is good. Last time they messed up our order but gave 50% off without having to ask. 2 hour waits for popular times so be sure to contact them 24 hours in advance to get the priority seating which will cut your wait time in half."
"So after I wrote my first review, the owner contacted me privately and apologized and asked what he could do to. I responded to that message and he never replied. So it makes me feel like he was being insincere. I definitely will not be returning."
"Born and raised in Chicago, my boyfriend and I are both Gino's fans. Like Lou's too. Went to pequods for the first time last week and it seemed like the crappier combo of those two. Crust kinda reminds me of Lou's, sauce and cheese of Gino's (if you can even consider what they put on it to be sauce). To be honest, the crunchy burnt cheese or whatever it is on the crust was gross. In addition, the pizza had no taste. My boyfriend said the leftovers were disgusting. The Caesar salad was also weird; I've never had one with mixed greens before. It honestly seemed like a house salad with Caesar dressing but I guess that's how they do it. The Chicago location is a dump, one of the dirtiest establishments I've ever been in. I sat down and had sauce on my shirt and a dirty mushroom on my leg cause the table was dirty. People who think this is the best in Chicago or even represents Chicago are insane."
Literally the rudest people ever work here. Grey haired man at the door a jerk from the moment we walked on. Empty tables not being sat while people are waiting an hour and a half. Don't waste your time.
"All right lets get right into the nitty gritty!!!!!I've been eating pequods for some time now. The pizza is always second to none. No issues here. And the crust.... :)I know a few farmers from downstate Illinois who harvest every vegetable the seasons allow. If they knew, that the drec a la drec was being served at this restaurant, they would cancel all outbound veggie shipments to this place. I'm talking of course about the Pequod salad. Whoever prepares these awkward collection of dried lettuce, mediocre toppings, and dressing that has enough oil to start a forest fire, should go pound salt!!!!!! I know it's a pizza business but for Christ sake - STAY AWAY FROM THE SALAD - GIVE THE 9.99 TO A PEDDLER ON THE CORNER!!!!!"
We ordered two pizzas we were on a pizza crawl. Thin sausage came burnt ate it anyway. We did not complain because it was our first time there and didn't know if it was suppose to be burnt. All the hoopla over this place how and why would they serve a burnt pizza right? Ordered a deep dish sausage also. It looked burnt but was told by the waitress it was suppose to look like that. I only asked because the waitress was wrapping our thin crust for us to take home and pointed out to us our thin crust was burnt. lol lol lol lol. She adjusted our bill. I don't understand the appeal of this place. Sausage tasted like allspice. Not a fan. As far as the staff at the door they are not welcoming and really lack any hustle. They seated us pretty fast but I had to ask for a server after ten minutes.  We arrived at 4:30 on a sunday afternoon. While waiting for our pizza we observed at least 25 people waiting to get a table. I wont be back not my taste or atmosphere.
"Sooooooo disappointed! Ordered extra cheese & barely got any on a 16"" Thin. 6 tiny pieces of sausages? What is up with the ""hype"" on this pizza? No real taste yo the sauce & too much dough."
"Wow, expected a lot!!!  Actually just expected people to get my order right.  Sent me the wrong pizza after waiting an hour and a half for delivery.The wings tasted terrible and had weird texture.  Skip them!The garlic bread was over buttered and over seasoned, couldn't even finish them!Honestly, the pizza was good, but how do they get the order completely wrong? Luckily I wasn't allergic to green olives because they added those.** Asked for meat on one half.... they put it on the entire pizza.  My girlfriend is vegetarian.  She couldn't eat,  ruined her night.  Real upset I spent $35 on what I did not want."
"Maybe we went on an off night, but I wasn't really feeling Pequod.  Here are my thoughts:1.  Not really a deep dish pizza, but more of a pan pizza.   Think thick crust like Pizza Hut.2.  Tomato sauce, pepperoni, cheese and sausage were good and of high quality.3.  Sauce to cheese ratio was completely lacking.  There were sections when I honestly could not find ANY cheese.I left the meal feeling pretty underwhelmed.  Paying $30+ to eat thick bread with a smear of tomato sauce, cheese, and 2 pieces of sausage per slice.  Again, maybe we went on an off night, considering all of the other great reviews."
"It's our tradition, following a hard weekend at Renegade Craft Fair to hit up Pequod's for delicious pizza. It's always so delicious and worth the wait. This review is mainly about the service received. We sat down, party of 5, and requested waters right away - it was a long long day. Server comes back, no waters, takes our drink order (including mentioning waters again). Returns with beers, no waters. We ask one more time for water and she hears us as if we had never asked before.  5 waters are then brought to the table and the final one was dumped, ice bucket challenge style on my friends sitting on the end. They were shocked out of their mind.  I never heard her, but others said she said sorry at that time, but it was so much commotion that it didn't come across. She brought over napkins and then that was it. My poor soaking friends took it in great stride. We know accidents happen, we just wish there had been some sort of apology. Some remorse over the fact that they had to sit in the super A.C.'d upper level with a huge puddle at their feet and freeze as we waited for our pizza. Pizza arrived, delivered by someone one else and she lost control of the scalding pan and it slid on the table right towards my friend who received the brunt of the water. Thankfully the server caught it before it could burn the crap out of my friend, but seriously, the only torture we expect pizza waiting is from our grumbly stomachs, NOT the waitstaff. Again, TOTALLY get accidents happen. We have all been servers before, I just would have handled that situation so differently. I would have apologized more than once, I would have come back to see if we were comfortable, I would have offered to move us so we didn't have a puddle at our feet, and I would have talked to my manager to see if there was any sort of compensation that could be provided. That's basic customer service. We were all kind of appalled to see that not even the ice tea was comped. Perhaps it's entitlement, but I can't remember the last time I was at a restaurant and a mistake went unacknowledged like that. Now here was the hardest part. As check was delivered, and again, no apologies were ever made outside of the drop we had to contemplate tip. Some would say none, the service was terrible. Some would say the regular 20%, accidents happen. I kept going back and forth, again being a server... what if this was the worst day of your life and this happened to you.  But again, if it was me that would inspire me to take great care of a table and show them how sorry I was. I wound up tipping 12% .... and we are most likely taking our tradition somewhere else next time."
"Oddly enough, despite my preference for NY style pizza, my friends ordered from Pequods last evening (I had Lou Malnati's at work during the day..check out that review from same day)No 'thin crust' this time just the deep dish with a pound of mozzarella and lots of sauce...For what it is, it was okIf you're looking for which is better Lou's vs Pequods I vote Pequods"
"Well. After recommending this place to everyone I know who visits my hometown, I'm thinking my endorsements may have been a mistake. I defend this place A LOT against warnings of insufferable service and bad crowd control. I am willing to cut them a lot of slack for their pizza. It is an attraction for which a bad personality is sometimes forgivable. And I've been coming long enough that I know better than to expect reliable service on a Saturday, or to attempt a table during the NBA playoffs. But on a Tuesday night, in the summer offseason with zero sports, you'd think the expectation of actually getting to eat the pizza you called in 20 minutes prior that was put in 'right away' is reasonable. Yeah?We order at 6:30. We get there after a cross-town trek. We think we're fine, since there's no wait when we called, and the order went in awhile ago. We go to check in amid largely vacant tables... and are told it'll be a 40 minute wait JUST to sit. What?Pequods, I get it. Your justification makes sense, it's just not very good. I work in customer service, and I know there's 'technically' no responsibility for you to update patrons (who already ordered and are headed to your restaurant) that an influx of HUGE parties has added 40 minutes to your previously nonexistent wait, but when you are bitchy about it on arrival, and act like it's unreasonable to be taken by surprise by this development, that's what stops fans from endorsing you. Did you have to call? No. If you had? You would've saved your loyal customers $20 in cab fare, a shitload of traffic, respect, and a wasted pizza. My life isn't your problem, I get that, but there's a courtesy in not springing this on a party for whom you've already told you're cooking food for. That's how you become a restaurant whose patron recommendations start carrying warnings.I've happily put up with the unpredictability on weekends or during sports events, but as a loyal recommender of this place, I'm really disappointed. I don't whine. I just want whoever monitors this to know that it's becoming a reputation people are listening to. Also, there were a ton of open tables given parties of 40 and 25 were supposedly occupying the bulk of the place, but given everything else I guess I'm not shocked we have a difference in logic. Pizza's the best in chicago if you can deal with the side of shit. Up to you."
"The gnats walking all over the wall probably didn't help me enjoy this restaurant. I've been here twice, hoping I'd understand why the lines are so long to get in, but I haven't.  I don't find the dough or sauce particularly tasty; the crust and sides tend to get burnt in the cooking process, which I think is their ""thang"" but there's not enough of it on the pizza to really enjoy it. Mixed experience with service.  I ordered pickup once from their Morton Grove location and I'd rate the pizza there a 3."
While visiting my aunt she suggested we try one of her favorite pizza spots. We started with mozzarella sticks that were best out of a box and baked and the cheese was so stiff I almost gagged. I opted to get a personal pan deep dish cheese only and the family got a medium pepperoni and sausage deep dish. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes or longer for your pizza to arrive. The pizzas are cooked and served in a cast iron pan. For me the pizza lacked flavor even with cheese only. The crust was thick and bland. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their pizza but I was not impressed.
"May be good pizza just don't plan on having a party of more than 15 people no room in this tight neighborly joint. The service was slow the food was ok and the count was off! Tried to charge for 23 people when only 19 people in our party! 1 whom was 18 , we never got got asked if everybody arrived in party and count. When we asked them to view camera for count the lady manager said she was calling the cops for interrupting her! My friends came over to buy my son a shot for his birthday and must have got counted in group. When she attempted to show her bill that she paid the manager said enough your ganging up on me! They need organization and proper arrangements for counting! We came all the way from Indiana and ordered platinum package! I even left cake because I was so upset!"
"What the? I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about.  SERIOUSLY.  I went here a couple of years ago and didn't like it,  but decided it give it a second chance tonight with my cousin from out of town. ..Holy overrated! First of all, our waitress was wack...I mean,  she could've just been having a bad day so whatever. Secondly, the menu is outdated and they really should invest in a drink menu or drink specials. The food?  No bueno. The burnt crust aka 'caramelized' crust on the 'deep dish' that everyone raves about was just awful. The pizza was bland and the sausage was gross. I mean, honestly I don't understand all of these elite reviews,  are we eating at the same place?! I love pizza, I really do & I guess you should give it a chance...I guess. Will I be going back?  Negative."
Too many excellent places for pizza in Chicago to waste time and money here. Have ordered twice from their take-out location at Chicago and Dearborn and both times they got the order wrong. Very expensive to boot. Employees seem clueless and preoccupied with their own cell phones when you arrive. Not sure it's smart to keep old credit card receipts by the take-out door either.
"Called ahead on a Sunday and was able to get a table for 5 without a long wait; I was happy about that and I recommend calling ahead.Once we sat down we ordered 5 beers and 2 pizzas immediately, knowing that it was going to take awhile. After 2 hours we never got our pizzas and had to leave in order to make it to a movie on time. We left $40 for the beers. It looked like ordering carry out was the way to go."
"Woman on the phone on Saturday night October 29 has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I called 4 times because each time I called it would ring and then just start beeping. If you answer a phone, you at the very least, tell the customer please hold, not just automatically put them on hold. On the fourth time I called, after sitting on hold for almost 5 minutes on the third time I called, she was just so rude. Don't be a hostess, or even a person dealing with customers in any manner, because just being kind can go a long way. I get that it's a Saturday night, and I get that it's a busy night, but if you are rude to people for no reason, you will not appreciate the way you are treated back. Pequods has pretty good pizza but every time I have dined in and done takeout/delivery, the service is just awful. I would've thought by now that after several online reviews, and I am sure in-person complaints, management would have taken steps toward improving the service."
"Amazing pizza; terrible service. If they tell you it will be an hour, prepare yourself to wait at least an hour and a half. And also prepare yourself for the employees to be as rude as you could imagine when you get frustrated that you're waiting 30 minutes more than you were told. Not sure even this pizza is worth it."
Not at all OMG this is NOT better that Lou Malnati's Pizza at all.  This is like Giordano's or Aurelio's Pizza.  To doughy and was like Ketchup on a cracker with cheese.  Not at all what I expected.Any true Chicagoan knows LOU Malnati's Rock as NUMBER ONE PIZZA.This was very disappointing since a lot of people I know love this place but then again none of them are Chicagoans!
"The pizza was so-so. I had a small cheese which was a perfect amount for one person-I had two pieces and had leftovers for lunch the next day. I just felt like in comparison to Lou's or Giordanos-Pequod's just didn't hit the mark. I was excited to try the crust, given all the positive reviews, but it just tasted burnt and was less than satisfying.Side note-I ordered this for delivery and the girl who answered the phone had a bit of an attitude. I generally hate calling places-would much rather order online, but I didn't see an option to do so. I wanted to try this place since it had such good reviews, but the girl on the phone really turned me off. Other side note-the guy who delivered it was totally cool, and definitely made up for the not-so-good service over the phone!Overall-meh. Not terrible, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
Ordered at 11:00pm on a Friday.  I know I deserve what I get that that time but they advertise delivery until 2:00pm.  I was told 1.5 hours.  Seemed long but expected.   It's 1:30 pizza guy got lost twice coming to a prominent hotel.Really shitty.  This pizza better be good.
"Had my brother in from out of town and wanted the deep dish experience so we went to Pequod's on a recommendation. We ordered sodas, a light appetizer and a deep dish pizza. We were told the pizza would take 40-50 minutes. 1 hour 15 minutes goes by and the waitress comes to our table to inform us that the kitchen never received our ticket (even though we received the appetizer an hour earlier) and said the kitchen will rush it but it would be at least another 20 minutes, and is that ok? No we said we could not wait and cancel the order. She said she would get the manager, who never did come to our table, and she returned with the check that had the pizza taken off but still charged us for the sodas and appetizer. Ridiculous. We will not be returning."
I have friends that enjoy it here so I tried it out twice and just not impressed. I wanted to like it but service was rude both times and I'm just not impressed with the pizza. So much sauce...just not a good balance for me. On a positive note it is a convenient place to stop before a mid-day movie.
"I moved out of Chicago last week, and based on yelp reviews, I picked this place for my last Chicago meal. It was underwhelming. We got the cheesy bread as an app and a medium deep dish pizza. The cheesy bread was store bought bread, lots of cheese, with garlic powder on top.A 7 year old could have made this. The pizza itself was meh. The famous crust was a little too burnt for me, I think the amount of black on the crust was unhealthy. It was good pizza, but nothing at all memorable. I'm glad I read the reviews that said to get extra cheese, because their regular amount of cheese would not have been proportionate to the overall pizza. I would give this place 3 stars, but I had to tack a star off for the poor and slow service."
My co-workers were really excited about consuming this pizza & promised me that this would blow away other deep dish establishments that I enjoy. Maybe it was too hyped up or maybe it just really isn't that good.All I know is I had a whale of a time digesting all that dough and burnt crust. The thin crust was just ordinary.
"Did Pequods recently change their recipe because my pizza was not good recently. Ordered three pizzas last night in which we waited almost 2 hours to get deliverered. Then when it came it looked so sloppily put together. Almost ALL bread, very very little cheese, tons of not so good sauce, and burnt crust. Sad sad disappointment Pequods. You used to be one of my favorites."
"Food: 3 out of 5Price: $$ out of $$$$Service: -5 out of 5I don't generally leave reviews unless I had exceptional or terrible experience. In this case, it was probably one of the worse service I have encountered at a restaurant... ever.We (7 of us) arrived at the restaurant on time for 6pm reservation. We were promptly seated 15 minutes later. We knew this was a very popular restaurant during dinner time so we expected reasonable wait (45min~) for our pizza to be ready. Knowing this, we ordered some wings, meatball sandwich (no cheese), large pizza pie and pitcher of beer. Beer and wings arrived shortly. Wings and beer were fine until my friend discovered a fly in his beer halfway thru his drink. We didn't make a big deal out of it thinking it's an innocent mistake. We told our waitress about it and she brought my friend a new glass of beer. So far so good... kinda.1.5 hours later, we are still waiting. Still no pizza, no meatball sandwich, no explanation by our waitress for the delay. We asked our waitress how much longer, and she says 5 more minutes. 25 minutes later, nothing (almost 2 hours of wait so far). We asked our waitress again, and she says 5 more minutes. Pizza finally arrives and we remind our waitress we are still waiting for meatball sandwich without cheese (one of our friend can't eat dairy). She said sandwich should be coming soon. We finish our pizza 20 minutes later and still no meatball sandwich. We ask our waitress about it, she said 5 more minutes (it's been almost 2.5 hours for meatball sandwich so far). 15 minutes more pass and finally meatball sandwich arrives but WITH cheese (it's been 2 hours and 45 minutes for a wrong sandwich). At this point we are fairly irritated because we waited 2 hours for a pizza and 2.75 hours for a meatball sandwich that my friend can't eat. At this point we decide to complain to the manager, Shawn. We explained our situation and he acted like ""oh well"". At no point did he apologize (for either wait or wrong order) or offer to fix the situation. He kept on saying ""wish there was something we can do"" without real resolution suggested. At this point, most restaurants with good customer service would have offered something for the terrible experience but nope, not Shawn. He just waited for us to leave. We did get a small discount for the meal (which wasn't what we were after) in the end but we left feeling petty and like shit.All we wanted was an apology and if we had received it, I wouldn't have written this review. I guess with plenty of customers other than us, they don't need to make things right even when they mess up."
"We went this evening. First time there and the pie was outstanding. Did not disappoint. We had both pan and thin crush and both were excellent.  Among the best I've ever had. So why only 2 stars? The service sucked! And to be specific, out server SUCKED! Don't know her name, only know her as server MZ07. Here are the lowlights.1) Bitch slapped us for wanting new silverware after our salads. Said they were too busy to roll silverware into napkins and that we should have kept what we had. Really? My gal joked that she would gladly go role her own, and without hesitation or a smile was told that was ""not an option"". As though we were serious.2) We waited 80 minutes for our pizza's while other larger tables that came in after us got theirs ahead of us. No apology, no sorry for the delay, nothing.3) Asked for more water and got attitude when we thought she didn't hear us.4) Not once did she ask us how our meal was. Not once! I know she was busy, but come on. It's called very basic customer service.5) My favorite. When I asked for the check and got no acknowledgment, I asked again. All I got was a very stern ""I heard you""!One of the least pleasant servers we've ever had. I fully understand that the place was packed and that it's a very challenging job to say the least. That said, as long as you're at it you might as well try to be good at it. Try being just a little pleasant. She might want to consider another line of work. Just sayin'"
"Pequods has terrible service, extremely long wait times and below average pizza. If I never have to go near this place again it will be too soon.Not worth the hype."
"I first saw Pequods on Chicago's Best and the pizza look absolutely delicious both deep dish  and  thin crust that had to be for the cameras,  I decided to order a thin crust with sausage.  I was totally disappointed .I didn't mind the delivery guy being a little late due to traffic  that's Chicago and I didn't mind the price because I pay for what I want the pizza itself was absolutely TERRIBLE,  bland tasting,  one piece of  sausage on every other slice and I purchased a large pizza,  sorry to say I will not be purchasing any more pizzas from Pequods.they lost a customer in me."
"First things First.  Pequods is NOT deep dish pizza.  Its PAN style  Says it right on their website...http://pequodspizza.com/chicago/about/  Pequods does a lot of things good.  Their Marinara sauce is unreal, sausage is well seasoned, and the almighty crust cannot be messed with.  The problem for me with Pequods is that I have to eat the part before the crust in order to get to it..supposedly its frowned upon to order pequods, cut out the center of the pie for everyone else and just eat the crust.  I never really understood pan.  Its 75 percent bread and 25 percent cheese/sauce.  I want the exact opposite when eating Deep Dish.  My favorite DEEP DISH is still Giordanos.  Pan is whack"
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!  I ordered a pizza for my family at 6:30PM. I was told it would take an hour and 20 minutes. After an hour and 30 minutes, I called to ask the status of our order. At that point, I was informed that it'd be another 30-45 minutes because my order wasn't placed until 6:50PM. I questioned the delay (I called at 6:30PM and certainly did not have a 20 minute call). At that point the manager got on the line to tell me they had a computer glitch, my order wasn't entered until 6:50PM, and I would have to wait an additional 30-45 minutes. I asked to have my order cancelled (my family was hungry and I would order elsewhere). At that point, the manager complained that I was in the wrong and hung up on me!!!!We WERE regulars at this place. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
"This place is nothing special, in fact its pretty sub par. I'm not sure if Pequod's USED to be good and has just lost its touch but I can definitely say this place's pizza is boring.What I ordered:Onion Rings (about 7 of them pathetically displayed on a plate)12 inch Deep dish pizza with Sausage and BasilThe Crust - Spongy cornmeal somewhere in between buttery, crispy and soggy. Not terrible but as far as a foundation for a pie its nothing exciting.The Sauce - If there were any herbs or spices in the sauce, I couldn't taste them. Pizza suffers the most when the sauce is bad and this was just tomato paste and sugar with maybe a sprinkle of pepper.The Cheese - this was the most disappointing part of the whole meal, there was no flavor and no salt. My professional guess is that they use a cheap skim milk mozzarella, no provolone or whole milk. It reminded me of peal and eat mozzarella sticks from a gas station, but that would be insulting cause at least those are loaded with sodium.The Toppings - the second worst part about this pizza, it was adorned with about 10 pieces of sausage the size of golf balls and what was probably 3 leaves of furiously fine shredded basil. The sausage was actually pretty good but there wasn't nearly enough of it, about 2 pieces a piece. And the basil, I'm not sure they even put any on it."
Pequod's is not the place you should go to for Pizza if your in Chicago. I do applaud that they are open on New Years Eve but it's to many choices to go to in Chicago with better tasting pizza.
"Am I the only one that doesn't like this place?  It was SO overrated!  The pizza was very average and nothing special, especially for the prices.  But, the worst part was definitely the sound of crashing plates coming from the kitchen....I felt like I was at a concert.  I couldn't even hear the people at my table!As a side note, the priority seating list completely failed.  We still had to wait 30 minutes for our table.  Even though we pre-ordered our pizza, it still took another 20+ minutes!Chicago is a GREAT pizza city, but this place is definiely not at the top of the list."
"If you are waiting for an hr wait pizza for its legacy tradition, then be ready for an additional hour on top. Just for good measure. Pizza is good I presume, but didn't get to taste it as had to leave 2.5 hours after arrival. Maybe the positive reviews this establishment gets is because the wait that they make you endure, thus causing great hunger and therefore a positive feeling of some sort. How knows"
"I'm not sure what all the hype is about???Detroit style crust attached to way too much dough...it was more dough than anything. The sauce and pepperoni were excellent. Service was pleasant.We came here via a recommendation from a local and were expecting to be floored at how great this pizza is, but left scratching our heads.We've had better pizza in the culinary wasteland of mid-Michigan for crying out loud!"
A disappointing meal. The food took a really long time to come out (90mins approx)- we were a larger group but the food didn't all come at once so it was surprising that it took so long. We ordered some starters which seemed to have just come straight out of a frozen packet- not very flavoursome. I had deep dish pizza with a mix of vegetables. The toppings were good but the base tomato sauce and cheese was not to my liking. Other people in our party had a mix of deep dish and thin base and seemed to have a similar complaint. Overall it just didn't have a great flavour. I've heard great things about this place so maybe it was because it wasn't what we were used to pizza wise. Staff were pleasant and attentive
"I give this pizza a meh, the toppings were nice and fresh, the sauce is good, the crust is total crap flavorless, crumbly, and the bottom crust wet, soggy, and just fell apart when I tried to grab my first slice. Overall I wouldn't order it again delivery took an hour and half which is understandable on a Friday night, but not worth it when the pizza is this low quality."
Worst delivered pizza I've ever seen and eaten. It was a disgusting explosion of pizza in a box. See pics
"good service, nice place, very long wait and very disappointing pizzathe crust was not cooked thoroughly, tomato and other ingredients doubtly fresh, not vowed by it at allonion rings were mediocre (frozen) and chicken wings good as in any other million places around here 2 people = $40we're not coming back"
"Called in the afternoon to make sure we were on the priority list, when we got there we were told 30 minutes tops for our party of 3... As 50 minutes go by we start to notice big parties who came after us made comments that they paid under the table to get in earlier, of course they get seated... As I ask the host when will my party be seated he then can't even give me a time and just says there is two parties still ahead of us. Sad to have wasted my time. I get this place is popular and constantly packed, but at the end of the day ever person deserves the same respectable service... flat out disappointing."
"Honestly, I thought this pizza was very average. Gave up carbs for 16 days, only to break it by eating this pizza - which sadly wasn't worth it. I ordered a half pepperoni/half green pepper and onions pan pizza. The bread is way too doughy, minimal sauce, minimal cheese, and super large ingredients. The only part I actually liked was the caramelized crust. Apps - Cheesy Garlic Bread - literally just took a roll, cut it in half, added butter, garlic and cheese...not much to it. There wasn't any seasoning or anything special about the bread. Also got Mozzarella sticks - these were obviously frozen before, and ended up being soggy by the time they came to me. I wish I could have loved this place, but it just didn't happen."
The pizza was ALL cheese. I realize this may be their trademark however a real pizza is all about the crust (bread crust)
"Wow, I sure don't get what all the hype is about. I found the pizza dry and unremarkable.  My Pie/Lil' Guys is a much better deep dish in my opinion. But the real reason I'm giving them one star is that I called on a Tuesday night and was quoted a 90 minute delivery window. It actually took nearly 2 hours, and of course was barely warm when it go here.I'll not be ordering again."
"Underwhelming! So after waiting half an hour to be seated we were sat at a table about a foot and a half in width. Not only was the table tiny it was in the middle of the narrow restaurant ( more of a bar really) where people kept bumping our table and a waitress spilt my bfs beer all over him. We moved tables when one became available but the waitress threw my full beer away and took 20 minutes to replace it. When we got our pizza an hour later it was less than average. The only reason I came here was because it was rated the best deep dish in Chicago, I'm from california so I really wanted to try Chicago pizza. It was also really over priced, I'd rather eat round table than here!"
"Maybe I was expecting a lot. I was in Chicago for a few days and I really wanted to try their famous deep dish pizza. Given the high reviews, I thought this would make an excellent first experience. Thinking this place might be busy, I had called this place to make a reservation. When I arrived and told them of my reservation, I was asked to wait for almost half an hour despite there being open tables. They were however very busy so I let this one slide.I was told the pizza would take a while to cook so I ordered some appetizers while we waited. I ordered the appetizer combo which consisted of mozzarella sticks, jalepeno poppers, breaded mushrooms, and something else that I dont even remember. Why dont i remember? because they all tasted the same. They were all just breaded up in some bread crumbs and deep fried and tastes more like something from the frozen foods aisle of a grocery store than a restaurant. Even the presentation sucked. But I let this one slide as well. This is a pizza place after all, and I should let pizza be the judge of this place. So the pizza came and it looked great. After a few bites, I must say that it was okay. I really really tried to like it, but it tasted okay. The ""carmelized crust"" was more like burnt crust. Unlike a normal deep dish where it is comprised mostly of cheese and toppings with a thin crust, here the pan pizza had a very thick crust and a very thin topping. I felt like I was eating a pizza bagel.After this experience, I almost believed that I just didnt like chicago pizza. Thank god I went to Lou Malnati's two days later and had some real deep dish. It was delicious!"
Ordered a pizza and asked them to freeze it so I could bring it back to Seattle with me. Something they do all the time. Show up (after paying extra for my uber driver to take me there) and they took down the order wrong. Not frozen. Terrible experience.
This was my first time having pequods and also my last. Was quoted at an hour and a half for delivery. 2 and a half hours later I had to call and they had no idea where the pizza was but it arrived shortly after. The actual pizza is my least favorite deep dish in the city. Way too much bread with hardly any cheese or sauce. The burnt crust is delicious and unique but not enough to save the rest. Glad I got to pay full price for a lukewarm pizza after 2 and a half hours.
"For the life of me.. I cannot understand why or how anyone finds this food enjoyable. Both thin crust and deep dish taste like a trial run homemade pizza - done horribly. The sauce tastes like it's right out of a can, the crust is dry and tasteless, and the cheese came sliding all around the pizza - hardly cooked or sliced properly. The only reason I gave it a second chance was because they messed up my order the first time - Sent me a deep dish when I ordered thin crust, then gave me a credit instead of refunding the money. Thanks for the credit, but everything I've tried is just.. Bad."
The pizza was very average. I was told it was amazing. There was nothing amazing about average pizza. Lou's pizza 4ever.
"So I never write reviews, but I tried this place because it looked amazing on Chicago's best. For the record I don't live in the area, I live on the very border of their delivery area, so there are some things I expected. Like possibly the food being a bit cold or the pan pizza to be a bit soggy. But to be honest it looked amazing when it arrived, still steaming hot and nice crunchy looking crust, I ordered a medium pan pizza sausage and half onion, THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST PIZZAS IVE EVER HAD!!! INCREDIBLY BLAND, NO FLAVOR, NO SEASONING! NOTHING!!!! I ordered a small cheese for my kids, and it was the same thing, bland and plain! Super disappointing.. I will not be ordering again."
"I called earlier tonight with the hopes of getting a pizza. I was greeted with one of the rudest greetings I've ever encountered while ordering food. I seemed like an inconvenience. They closed at 2 am so I asked if a 1:30 am delivery was too much of a hassle. I was told no, but that's when things got ugly. ""Okkkkkkk"" was the response from said individual when I requested a large pan pepperoni. It was as if I was making her night harder. How dare I order a pizza within their operating hours? I've ordered from the Morton Grove location many times and it's always been fantastic, but this was incredibly pathetic service. I don't normally leave reviews, but this was so incredibly insulting that I had to. The attitude I was greeted with was incredibly pompous, and I immediately ended the transaction. Management, I called at precisely 1:25 AM. It was one of the worst ordering experiences I've ever had. If you value your customers, you'll do something about the rude employee I spoke with."
Was super excited to try this place after hearing so much. We ordered take out and the lady who took our order was great. We got home and I was super excited to dive in to the pizza. I cut myself a slice to find that this wasn't deep dish. This was an inch tall cornbread dough with some sauce and cheese on top. The carmalized crust was burnt cheese that didn't make the whole circumference of the pizza. I was disappointed. I prefer Lou malnatis or giordanos.
"Warning: NOT CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA! My experience with people who rave about this pizza is they are usually not from Chicago. As far as pan pizza goes.. this is more like pizza bread. The pizza is simply a VERY thick bread with sauce,cheese and toppings. Granted, it doesnt taste bad at all.. its just not real chicago style. The burned cheese/crust thing is good.. but not good enough to bring me back. Lou Malnatis butter crust is better. The pizza here is not like the real stuff you get at Lou Malnatis, Giordonos, Ginos East, or Gullivers. Really, the best way to describe it is pizza bread. Also, the service was medicore. We had a big group,which I understand is difficult, but she was terrible. She forgot appetizers and brought them when we got our food and getting a refill on a drink was next to impossible. All the hype about this place is really just all talk. Go someplace else if you want pizza.    PS. The bathrooms upstairs are very strange. The auto hand dryer is right above the toilet. when u are sitting and doing your thing it blows on you the whole time. It was very uncomfortable. If we hadnt already ordered our food I would have left because of that!"
"I've been to Pequods a few times and if I averaged them all out, this is definitely an accurate score. I understand Pequods was recently featured as one of the best pizza places in the country, which explains the insane volume of patrons attempting to fulfill their deep dish needs. However, that's no excuse for three and a half hour ""dining"" experiences. A thirty minute wait with a 45 minute pizza cook time is totally acceptable... Not 90 minutes and 90 minutes. I will say the pizza is normally fantastic. This last time it was subpar, but I'm assuming (hoping) that was due to the volume of orders coming though. I will say that the restaurant manager was working his tail off and did everything in his power to help the place run smoothly. At one point he was holding a large deep dish while running a tables credit card and taking a phone order. He deserves a raise."
"Just starting off that this is my favorite deep dish pizza place. Great pizza! I go pretty often but this is the second time in which I had very poor service. We ordered 1 10"" pizza that took an hour and half to make. And the server only came to our table once even though she kept going up to every table around us, it was really odd. She only came when the pizza arrived (someone else brought the pizza and served it to us.) and she noticed that our waters were empty. So for the entire hour and half that we were waiting for our pizza, she didn't come up to our table. Our pizza also ended up burnt and I to flag the waitress down to tell her. Manager took it off the bill and gave use a gift card though. Staff just didn't really seem apologetic to be honest. No thank you or sorry when we left, waitress just handed us the gift card because we got up from our table. Note this is the second time I received bad service (there's another yelp review about that experience from someone else)."
"The worst service ever,got to wait 2 hrs for a fucking pizza,plus the waitress suck ass.she never went to ask us if we need anything, and by the way we still waiting for our fucking pizza,fuck you pequads pay more money to your cooks and front of the house so they can perform better, fuck you guys again"
Worse service I have ever experienced in my life! NEVER coming back here me and my boyfriend got seated within 1 hour and 30 minutes when we first of called in and she said we would get seated right away and then we get there and they tell us something different. We had to complain and asked to speak to a manager right when we said we want to speak to a manager the host (which was a guy I don't remember the name) got scared and goes ok I'll get you seated right now. He had people go in that we're after us and goes to show you he isn't playing it right. Our waitress literally only took our order and Never came back to check up on us we were confused on who our waitress was. The pizza also took another hour. Just HORRIBLE I rather go to Lou mantis and not have a bad experience with better pizza. They definitely need a whole new management of how they run the system because I honestly never such bad experience.
"Terrible customer service. Ordered a pizza via telephone. Was told it would be ready in an hr. When I went in to pick up the pizza, I was told that the girl manning the pick up orders was not at her station but she would be back soon (apparently nobody else can help you). After waiting 15 mins for her, she finally took my name and payment. Instead of going straight back and getting the pizza or sending someone else, she took everyone else's name and payment before getting all of our pizzas. The whole process took 30 mins. When I finally got my pizza, it was tepid. This was my first and last experience with Pequods. GO TO LOU MALNATIS! The pizza and service is so much better!"
"Not great at all. Really unhappy. There are so many better places in Chicago for pizza. A co worker suggested this place, sad I wasted my money and brought family from out of town here."
"I don't know. I was underwhelmed the first time and I just had it again yesterday. Left me disappointed...again. Caramelized crust? Doesn't compare to Lou's buttered crust. Sausage as a topping, not inside under the gooey cheese? Such things  should only be done if it is a thin crust. Very doughy. Yea, the $5 lunch special with beer is a delicious option. But even at that price, I might be tempted to pick up a beer and go to Art of Pizza for their slice. Skip."
Eh. Not so much. Too bready.Lou Malnati's is way better.
"All bread, bottom was burned. THIS IS NOT DEEP DISH! It was edible but nothing special. The salad was much better. Love the cheese."
Customer service is absolutely aweful- and the manager has no respect for the people actually waiting in line to come
"Pequods used to be really good, I've got gone there now 3 times in the last 3 months and its just not that great.  I've waited till the 3rd trip to write a review hoping for some change.The staff look like they just rolled out of bed and came to work.Service is slow.apps are all fried and probably frozen beforeThe pizza here is just hyped up, its not that great anymore.  I remember years ago it tasting real good.  The one good thing is that they were open on Christmas."
We ordered a pizza for delivery and the order was wrong / the delivery driver had no change thus making it difficult to give her a tip . The pizza was doughy / it looked like a mess when we opened the box . The charred crust was tasty but that was about it . Gino's and Lou's much better in my opinion . What a disappointment - maybe it's better dining in but delivery was not good
"This review is on pizzas that we ordered for delivery.  I've never had pequod's, but have heard great things about it.  When I ordered around 11:45, I was quoted 1 hour and 20 min. Totally understandable for a Sunday afternoon.  When I called after 1 hour 45 min,  making sure the address was correct, they said the delivery guy was close and it should be there within a few minutes. I called again after 2 and a half hours, and they called the delivery guy again. He was finally at our street, almost a full hour after the quoted time. Pizza was okay, but not very hot anymore. The deep dish was not as saucy as I would have liked. Thin was better, in my opinion. Maybe it tastes better to eat the pizza in the restaurant, but would not order again for delivery."
"This place has really gone downhill.  4-5 years ago it was great but the quality has gone way down.  We went in for a table and it was a 2 hour wait!  I got my buzzer and they told me it would only work at their ""new bar"" the Whale tale""... I always go next door to The Drinkingbird.  They have half priced Draft beers on Sunday's!  Pequods told me the buzzer wouldn't work there (lie). The people that work there are great but pizza quality went down and they try to get you to pay $7 for a bud light at their new spot when I can get a good beer next door for cheaper!  Don't know why they would disrespect their neighbors!  Going to Lou's for now on"
"I came to Pequod's because I was visiting Chicago and heard it was THE place to get Chicago deep dish pizza. After waiting over an hour to to be seated, we placed our order and got a salad, some garlic bread, and the deep dish pizza with various toppings. Our appetizers came out fast but the pizza took over an hour to come. The reason for the two stars was that they totally messed up our order. The toppings we wanted were all wrong. I was tempted to correct the order but thought the new pizza might take another hour to come and we were starving, having waited for two hours. I did not find the pizza we did get very good. This was my first deep dish experience so maybe I just don't like deep dish but I found the pizza to be bland- bread with a ton of bland sauce, a little cheese and a mountain of toppings I didn't want. I heard I should try Giordano's so will the next time I visit Chicago. I think this place might be a little overrated."
"This Pizza wasn't better than Pizzeria Due,Came in and ordered a personal to go ,they gave it to me uncut I asked could they cut it ,the guy at the front desk wearing the CIA wire said they don't cut personal pizzas.that's like saying we don't take dollars on 5s and up,gtfoh.."
"We had it delivered yesterday. The pizza wa below average. Lots of bread and sauce with some cheese. If you like bread pizza, this is for you. Also,delivery was requested at 12:30. Was delivered at 1:15. The delivery guy said, it's not about you...you are not the only one on the route. Rudest customer service ever."
"yes, the burnt-cheese-on-crust is great. everything else is pants.the sauce is too sweet. the crust is too bread-y and too thick. there wasn't much cheese. the place is pretty dirty.i'd rather order an extra-crispy thin crust at Lou's. no, it doesn't replicate the burnt-cheese, but everything else is orders of magnitude better."
"Called to order a pizza and got put on hold immediately.  Stayed on hold for ten minutes, so I hung up and called back and the same thing happened."
"The pizza is great. We got ""priority seating"" days before for an 830 reservation to get there, and be told to wait 45-60min. To then wait 90min. To then get seated and see 10 open tables next to us. Seating is run horribly. Pizza is fantastic. They also charge for ranch dressing. It also took us getting the waitresses attention 3 times before they would take the bill."
"Arrived at 7PM and found a place at the bar while we waited for a table. WHAT is with this place? Air conditioning... Ever heard of it? Seating people at the empty tables scattered around... Ever tried it? Employees yelling obscenities at one another about customers... I don't know...Perhaps don't. Waiting two hours for a pizza that we were told would take 45 minutes. Tick tock... Over two hours later we told them to forget it and to box it up. ""Oh, it's another 18 to 20 minutes."" Whatever, we've waited this long. And then there it is. The illustrious pizza we've waited an entire evening for. Boxed in all its glory. Now three hours in the making. ""Excuse me, can I speak to a manager?"" ""Why, what for?"" ""I've been waiting a very long time for this pizza that I'm pretty sure doesn't exist. Everyone around us has come and gone, all with pizza."" ""Well, something is off with the kitchen tonight, they've lost three of my orders. If the manager comes back, I'll tell him."" Hey, manager... Where are you while your restaurant is an absolute disaster? It is now 10PM and we are leaving with the pizza in hand. Get home. Open it. Absolutely burnt to a crisp, exploded through the box and has now spilled onto my clothes...and 100% not the pizza we ordered. I give up. It went straight in the trash."
"Great pizza! However, do not call days in advance of when you plan to eat there and get placed on their ""preferred"" list. If your experience is like mine, upon arrival your name will not be listed on the sheet the host/ess pulls from as tables clear, and you'll wait over two hours to finally secure a table you thought you reserved days prior. I have no idea why a restaurant would hinder itself with a ""preferred"" list if its guests must remind them that they called ahead. I say do away with ""preferred"" altogether and seat first come first serve. That way all the suckers like me, apparently, would be saved the trouble of planning their meal around a restaurant that can't deliver. Their preferred process creates a false sense of hope that you'll actually get seated at your agreed time."
"The pizza is good, but you'll wait an hour to be seated (standing on the street outside on Webster) and then get ready to wait for a looong time for your pizza.  We were seated at 6:15.  We knew these pizzas take 50 minutes or so to bake, so as soon as the waiter came to our table we put in our order -- that was at 6:20.  Our pizzas came out -- no joke -- at 8:20.  Two.  Hours.  For a pizza.  No pizza is worth that ridiculous wait.  It's not Peking duck, folks.  By the time the pizza came I was the only one left out of our group of five, because we had a movie to catch and so everyone had to leave.  Worse, I got no apology from the manager or anything.  The waiter acted as if she couldn't have cared less.  All we got was a small discount.  I took those pizzas and dumped them in the trash.  Next time I'm going to Malnati's.  Bye bye Pequod's."
Pizza has a very thick crust to it but without any flavor at all. Tasted like a thick hard slab of dough. Wings were good but order was very small for the price. Waitress was annoying. I don't need to eat pizza here again unless I'm trying to throw away carbs and prevent myself from tasting anything. Was hoping this would be what people cracked it up to be but it was really a waste of time into another area of town and we left confused and dissatisfied.
"The past two times I've ordered here, the pizza has tasted stale/not fresh. The quality of their pizzas and customer service has definitely hit rock bottom."
"I usually love deep dish pizza, and good service...but received none of that.I understand that waiters and waitresses level of service can vary upon locations, but this one was pretty bad.  We got our orders taken and nearly 40 minutes passed until we got checked up on.  And the only reason why she stopped by was because our pizza was finished.  So we bite into our pizza to find out that the inside was cold, not warm or room temp, but cold.  The pizza looked like it had ingredients globbed on and there was no firm structure like Lou's.  It would just fall apart and in part, probably due to the uncooked factor.Save your money, Lou's, Giordano's, and Gino's are where you want to eat."
Was recommended this place by a local. Came here and was quoted a 1.5 hour wait and directed to a neighborhood bar while we waited. The bar was fine ( nothing to write home about) but we waited over 3 hours for a table...that's twice the quoted wait time!! Then after being very stern with the hostess and manager was seated and waited over another hour for our food. Although the server was nice the overall experience was terrible and definitely not worth the 4 hour wait...to sum it up...Go somewhere else!!!!
"Refused to deliver ONE street outside of their delivery range, even though their own website says (and i quote):""we are accustomed to making reasonable exceptions. Out of delivery range = additional $1.00""Literally ONE street.  Management, please make sure your ""dispatcher"" is on the same page as your store policies."
"this place has gone down hill quickly, incompetent order takers, delivery guys, and a manager named Kevin who ABSOLUTELY fails when it comes to satisfying a customer. Done,never order again after being a loyal 10 year customer.  Malnatti's here we come."
Great pizza!!!But actually my review is on the service! The service there is terrible. Half the time they get my order wrong and the attitude for the staff is undeserved. I stopped going because of the service...
"The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  So many other reviews say their pizza is ""amazing"" and ""unreal"" but the only thing unreal about it is that a pizza can be so thick with such little flavor.  The crust is literally over an inch thick but lacks taste except for the burnt cheese edges, which are palatable.  For almost $20 a pie this is a joke.  Flour and Stone kicks this place out of town, I don't see how it could be rated one of Chicago's best pizza places.  Either their employees review it every day on Yelp to boost it up or this whole Chicago pizza thing is a sham.Thanks for ruining dinner pequods...*wink"
"Yeah, I just don't get it. The pizza is an amorphous entity where it is unclear where the crust ends and the rest begins. Definitely pan pizza and not deep dish. And more importantly, just not very flavorful."
"Ordered for pick-up.  We were so unhappy with this pizza that we threw it away and ordered from Malnati's.  First, it really isn't a pizza.  The crust is so bready, it would more appropriately be called pizza bread.  Secondly, the crust is not caramelized, it is burnt. Finally, the pizza was out of balance:  too much sauce, not enough meat (canadian bacon).  The flavor of the toppings individually was actually pretty good, but the ""pizza"" did not come together as a coherent whole.  Not sure why people like this place.  Maybe it's the dining in experience?"
"OVERLOADING THEIR KITCHEN WITH CARRY OUT AT THE EXPENSE OF RESTAURANT CUSTOMERS! We were quoted 50 minutes for a pizza so we immediately ordered our pizza, an appetizer and a pitcher of pricey beer. After inquiring about our pizza to our waitress after an hour and fifteen minutes passed, she checked on the order and shrugged when returning to our table. Certainly not her fault. Then we asked to see the manager. He took around 10 minutes to arrive at our table. In the meantime, our MEDIUM THIN CRUST pizza arrived. People who arrived after us and were seated received their deep dish well before we did. The manager came to our table and just gave us an uncaring ""sorry"" which seemed a well rehearsed line.  We weren't looking for a free anything but he tried to say that we must have been told the 50 minute wait when the wait time was just changing????  Sincerity and customer appreciation is definitely missing. They have these kind of waits all the time and can't anticipate the timing just yet? Goodbye Pequod's. There are plenty of pizza joints just as good if not better in the City."
"So many places to go for good pizza in Chicago, i don't get why people suggest this one?? Usually packed and the pizza is mediocre at best. Pop next door to drinking bird for a better atmosphere and good eats (a little pricey though)."
"First time visiting Chicago and had high expectations for this place. Heard a lot of great reviews! Worst experience I've ever had. Ordered a personal pizza, waited an hour and a half after the order was put in. A manager never stopped by and our server didn't stop by until said time had gone by. After all that, the pizza was just okay. Definitely will not be recommending or coming back in the future. As a manager of a restaurant myself, I am pretty understanding when it comes to waiting, mistakes, etc... This establishment didn't seem to care or even apologize."
"Pequod's food is pretty good, not near the rep, and service is pretty wack a lot of the time. I know they're busy, but it's just pointlessly chaotic and kind of rude a lot. Last straw was waiting 45min only to find we'd crossed off the list accidentally...and being told it'd be another hour.  Ha ha!  Thanks anyway."
BURNT=NO BUENO. Inside=good. Outside=vomit. My high hopes for this place are definitely crushed. Just burnt. It was overall: subpar. That is all.
"Was excited to try this place, because I heard good things.  Called to ask how long the wait was, and they said a half hour.  Got there a few minutes later and they told me it was a two and a half hour wait.  I don't care how good your food is; don't lie to customers to get them in the door.  Left to go elsewhere."
"We ordered wings and fries for apps and a large cheese pan pizza.  For $8.95 you get 8-10 wing-halves (4-5 full wings).  For $3.95 you get a small plate of little fries.  The apps were good but standard.  The pizza isn't much more than a huge piece of bread.  It looked delicious when brought to our table and when we were served the first slice it had the gooey cheesy look you see in all the pictures on this Yelp page.  A few minutes in however, we realized we were eating nothing but a large crust with a thin slice of cheese on top and a smattering of sauce.  The sauce is very good and the carmelized crust  has a terrific texture to it.  It's very light in the middle with a crunchy bottom, but there's not much more to report.  My wife loves pizza and was very disappointed given all the rave reviews of this place on Yelp.The overwhelming crust and scant toppings got so bad that by the second slice she had stopped biting into the pie and turned it sideways so she would only get half the dough along with the cheese and sauce.  I went back to the initial website I saw that named Pequod's as one of Chicago's 'eight best pizzas' and realized that they recommended it be ordered with extra cheese and extra sauce.  I have to say that is pretty much spot on.  Ordering their pie any other way gets you nothing more than focaccia bread.   I should have checked that site before we went.   We plan to try maybe one more of these north side pizza places so many people gush about and that'll be all.  For the time being however, the next time we go out for deep dish, it will be to one of the mainstays, (Lou Malnati's, Uno's or Due's downtown, Giordano's in Hyde Park, etc.)We took home half of the pizza and never even bothered to reheat the leftovers; we forgot all about them, then tossed it."
"Pizza was pretty good. Quite saucy, which I like, but my husband does not. Anchorage's Moose's Tooth is our hometown fave and way better. Our complaint was with the wait. We were on our way to O'Hare for a 4:30 flight when we got to the restaurant at 12:25. The sign at the desk said the pizzas were a 60 minute wait. We were seated and ordered immediately. Sixty minutes later, our server said she had checked and pizza should be out in 10 min, but it took another 20+ minutes. More than an hour twenty for good/not great pizza. We scarfed down a piece and took the rest in a togo box."
"Pizza is good. Service is not. Would not recommend.Delivery times on Sunday night estimated at an hour and a half. Pizza was delivered to wrong address, and driver blamed this error on us, the customer.  When calling Pequod's back, both the person answering the phone and the manager were unfriendly and unsympathetic.Ultimately, our pizza was ordered at 6 PM and delivered at 8:30 PM after three phone calls to the pizzeria. Pizza was delivered cold. Again, would not recommend."
"I have been coming here for the last several years, it's a great deal for lunch, a personalized pan pizza and a drink for 4.95.I know that it takes at least 20 mins to prepare a pizza, especially at lunch, so I call my order in ahead of time, knowing what I want.  After years of eating  the pan pizza here, I wanted to try the thin crust pizza, so I ordered a thin 12"" sausage (also knowing there would be leftovers) and my wife ordered her usual lunch special, the pan, spinach pizza.We arrive within 15 mins, the food does not get to our table for another 20 mins, first time this has ever happened ..(was my order put in when I called?  I don't think so.)My wife's Pizza was it's usual fine self, good crust and all that as you can see from other reviews, this time not enough caramelized crust though in my opinion.What they pass off as thin crust pizza is not thin crust at all. They should just call it their regular pizza, lots of dough, too much for me to be called thin crust, it was OK, not what  I expected though.The server, who I  have seen there on many visits was busy.  She got some help from some of the male staff that were just looking for something to do.  Part of my wife's deal was a drink with her pizza, but the charge for refills was not explained, might have been on the menu, but we ordered on the phone), OK I guess, but the waitress asked my wife if she wanted some more diet coke, the glass was 1/4 full grabbed the glass refilled it and charged us 2.50 for that!  The manager took the 2.50 off the tab, which was about the tip for the meal anyway...(little less)  Bottom line: They need more staff for lunch service, explain charges, make a thin crust pizza, rename what you now call thin crust to regular pizza. It really reminded me of Chucky Cheese, which is sad.I will come back, but it is going to be at least 6 months or more for me.I need to give this place a rest."
"Server checked on us once during the entire meal. At the beginning, she told us to order an appetizer because the pizza would take over an hour to make. We ordered the bruschetta, which never came. This is probably some marketing ploy they tell you so that you drop more money on appetizers. Pizza burned the top of my mouth, I wish she would have warned me first. Overall not my best first experience with deep dish."
"100 minutes to get a deep dish pizza after ordering it on a Sunday night when seated inside the restaraunt.  We were quoted 60 minutes by server when ordering.  Had to ask a manager to find our pizza after 90 minutes, our server just ignored our table.  With the very long waits to get in, the poor service while seated, and the ridiculous wait time for pizza, I advise staying away from Pequod's Pizza."
"I'm clearly in the minority here, and while it sucks to be the unfortunate recipient of uncommonly poor service and food, I'm glad most other people haven't had their hopes of sinking their teeth into a real Chicago pie dashed like we did. Short version: ordered two pizzas and opted for pick-up to save ourselves the 45 extra minutes estimated for delivery. Tried picking up after the hour and fifteen we were told and nothing was ready. They asked for another 10 minutes, then 20. After another hour of waiting, we got one half cooked pizza and one completely raw pizza - I mean, white dough raw. They had forgotten the second pizza altogether, and we all know you can't rush deep dish. Well, they tried, and we tried baking it at home to make it at least edible. Horrible experience."
"I hate to say it but yeah definitely experienced better.  We went to Pequod's for deep dish last Saturday and of course had to wait.  After about 30 minutes we were seated at a booth that was broken.  The place itself looks really run down and could definitely use some work.  Our waitress could have been nicer.  She was efficient but not friendly and we think she forgot to put our pizza in because we waited almost an hour for it.  Then once we got it, it wasn't cooked all the way and the crust was chewy.  Overall can't stand up to Lou's and I wouldn't go back."
"I called my order in because it was a Friday night. and I figured that a Pizza place would be kind of busy. Was I right!!??!.. There was a line out of the door!!! I got a pizza with the caramelized cheese crust.  I was excited. Took the pizza home.. OK,,,, The pizza was alright. nothing to scream about. It was ..OK.. That's why I have 3 slices still in my fridge... If I NEEDED a meal..Yeah, I'd go there. It wouldn't be my first choice..I like more of a balance in my pizza. It was just TOO much bread..not enough sausage,or pepperoni, onions perhaps...All that breading?? Naw, Man!!! TOO much. Sorry... :-("
"Honestly, have gone here multiple times and it was delicious. We went last night and we're funneled next door to their new restaurant called whale tale? or something like that: so I guess this is more a review for that place. We were told they had the same pizza etc. Well, while the place was nice on the inside, but The pizza was AWFUL. Not sure how they did it, but managed to burn it on one side and the other side had a bunch of raw tomatoes and mushrooms on it. The pizza was flavorless, which is not the way I remember it. The waiter was super rude; when he asked if we wanted to take it home we said no it was not good, and he scoffed and was like, ""well haven't you had our pizza before."" And he brought it out any way and acted like we were dumb because we didn't like the pizza."
Whoever the purple haired gal is that takes the names for seating-she needs to find a new job- way too cool and way to rude! Waited over an hour and 15 minutes for a table and another hour for a pizza. I won't be back- too many other great places that have it figured out.
"The best pizza in the universe?No. I had very high expectations when coming here. I had heard so many raves about how this places measures up against Gino's and Giordano's and Uno's and Lou Malnatti's. No. We ordered a small pan pizza with green peppers, onions, sausage, and mushrooms. First thing, when I order pizza, I expect the toppings cooked. Maybe 10% of the veggies were soft enough to be considered somewhat cooked. And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't pizza toppings supposed to be incorporated in the pizza somehow? We literally got a crust with cheese and tons of raw toppings thrown on top, RAW. I got several huge chunks of pepper half the size of my hand on my slice. It was a salad with a cheesy crust. I will say the sausage was cooked, though. At least there's that. I was highly disappointed. I was expecting something close to pizza nirvana and I was severely let down. It wasn't even a pizza I would ever crave or want again. I came, I ate, I won't return."
The hostess kicked me out because I was watching the top 10 plays after eating my pizza... She was a horrible hostess... I like the pizza but the service was horrible... Never going back again... I wish they would treat people better.
"Waited almost an hour for pizza, which it was burnt all around the crust... you be the judge"
I'm not sure why this place is the rage because I was not impressed by the pizza I got here. The crust is ridiculously thick. It was like eating pizza sauce and some toppings spread thinly over a really thick piece of not-so-great bread. I didn't taste anything extraordinary about the caramelized cheese on the crust either because I didn't even notice it until I read the reviews on Yelp.
"Was great 5 years ago, when they cared about their product. Now they rush out orders of all dough and sauce, no meat toppings or cheese. To top it off got our whole party sick the next day, easter sunday to top it off."
"I was expecting really great pan pizza after hearing people rave about this place. However I was disappointed. The pizza had way to much bread and not enough cheese. The crust was lacking although it is prepared in such a way that the crust is just carmalized cheese. I would have like more cheese on the actual pie itself, and more flavor to the dough."
"Heard a lot about this place and always good things about the pizza. The food was worth the trip, the service is what ruined it for us. 4 of us visited on a Sunday night. Wait was only about 10 minutes which was awesome. We ordered one large pan which is definitely enough for 4.I was going to order a beer but she didn't come around again until half an hour later. At that point she told us it would be about 5 more minutes. After 20 additional minutes, almost an hour for one pizza, we were getting curious since tables sat after us had already finished their meals.  Long story short, our pizza had been burnt and they were giving us a discount. That stuff happens, so we were cool with it; I was glad they told us what was going on and offered a discount. But the discount was only $5 and they failed to mention to us that we had ordered premium toppings that were not indicated on the menu.  Food = worth the trip, Service = not so great"
"Here's the thing, when we first moved to Chicago we were really into this place and took all our visitors from out of town to check it out. Something about the novel idea of the crisped cheese on the crust and the freshness of the tomato sauce helped it to stand out above the other places we tried.Sadly, that is no longer the case. The pie we ordered the other day was bad in the worst way. This is not deep dish pizza, its more of a focaccia (fluffy, sort of cornmeal texture on the bottom) topped with whatever you choose. Think L and B Spumoni Gardens in NY but without all the goodness that place has. Our pizza had the thinnest possible layer of cheese on top of an inch or so of dough, with the tiniest spoonful of sauce spread over it. It was basically like eating a piece of dry focaccia with a burnt crust (yes I know they do the crisped cheese thing, but this time it was just burnt in the worst way).If you are excited about a rather a poorly topped piece of all-filler-no-killer bread, then this is your place. But if you want and actual stuffed pizza done right, go elsewhere. This place is off our list of recommendations for now."
"When I saw the yelp reviews on this place I decided I had to try it. It's possible that I caught them on an off night, but I won't be back. I ordered a large pan pizza for delivery with sausage on the whole thing, one half onion and green pepper, and the other half bacon. We were not quoted a delivery time and the pizza ended up taking around 1 hour and 20 minutes to be delivered. It wouldn't surprise me if this is standard for a Friday night, but it would have been nice to be told that on the phone. Additionally, the pizza arrived with canadian bacon instead of real bacon. I now know that they don't have bacon as a topping, but we ordered from our car without a menu and clearly asked for ""bacon"", not ham or canadian bacon. The person taking our order should have been able to catch this before it became a problem. As for the pizza, I was completely underwhelmed. They went REALLY light on the toppings. There were many bites that contained no toppings at all.This is very disappointing considering we paid 2.75 for full toppings and 1.75 for half toppings. I also wasn't a fan of the crust. It was like eating pizza off a soggy piece of bread. I'm not sure if the crust is meant to be like this or if the juices from the toppings soaked into the crust while the pizza was in transit to our house. Either way, it wasn't good. Overall, this was a terrible experience for $36."
"How the heck does this place have 4 stars? I mean the pizza took ONE hour to come, we had people next to use complaining they have been waiting for more than a hour. Finally when it comes I'm expecting some really great pizza for the wait, um NO! Think again it wasn't the best or worst but it's definitely not worth waiting a hour. I'd rather go to Lou malnati. To top it off the place was dirty we sat at a booth with wet napkins under our booth on the floor. No need for any more just a sad experience."
"Ok, so I lied -- this is now my final update.  Pequod's, we Love your pizza, both thin crust and pan, with a capital L.  Pequod's, we Hate that you screw up our order every single damn time.  We stopped ordering for a long while since my last update, but gave in because we missed your pizza so much.  Damned if you didn't go and screw it all up again tonight, now for maybe the last time.  Seriously -- pizza is not like building the space shuttle, nor should be running your business after all this time, but apparently it is.  We're back up to 5 or so times in a row of the order being wrong, so it looks like we're going to have to find a new place for pizza.  Thanks.Some tips:  make adjustments in your POS so the notes are clear to the kitchen; if the kitchen can't read tickets make sure you teach them; have your phone order takers read the order back to us to clarify; and lastly, don't even try to argue with us or blame us if the order is incorrect.  We know what we ordered because we know what we like to eat.Jeez, Pequod's, really.  Get it together."
"I've heard from two sources now that this on of the best pizza places in Chicago. So me and my mom went and checked it out, we both not only disappointed but didn't like the ingredients. Sauce was off, cheese was off or maybe too much, ingredients were off, weren't great tasting and just didn't fit w/ the cheese and the sauce. So if you're from Chicago (tisk tisk... ), out of town, not only the typical popular chain restaurant Chicago pizza places, but if you want the low down from someone who's had great pizza places in multiple cities, you need to check out Coalfire, little bit east of Wrigley Field / East Lakeview, and Jim n' Petes, W. 'burbs / Melrose Park (hopefully they didn't change it). It's a also a pain to get to, not really close to public transportation and it's a little bit of a drive out there when there's better pizza downtown."
"I know people that love this more than anything. I personally do not enjoy this pizza. It lacks taste to me in addition to the burnt taste that accompanies the caramelized crust. Service when dining in was good, as was the lively enjoyable atmosphere."
I went for the first time i have been eating pizza for about 40 years and i half to truly say this is the WORSE pizza i have ever eaten. Hardly any cheese we got a veg. and 1 with beef where is the VEG. and the BEEF and the CHEESE what a waist of money and time crust was BURNT to where you could not eat it some people in my party didn't even eat that was sad. NEVER AGAIN IF I COULD GIVE PEQUODS A BIG FAT 0 STARS I WOULD.
"Their lunch special is pretty decent - $4.95 for a personal deep-dish pizza with one topping and a beer or a soda. I got the lunch special with sausage and mushroom toppings. Out of all the deep-dish pizza joints I've tried in Chicago, this one was the best. However, it still wasn't that great. The waitress on the other hand was not friendly at all. She came to us yawning and looking really bored. While we were ordering and once we were done ordering, she just gave us a really blank stare - no expression on her face whatsoever.Overall, the pizza was average and the service sucked."
"How is this place so popular??  Its just an ordinary sports bar.  The thin crust pizza is very meh, totally bland.  Didn't like it.  No atmosphere.  I guess the deep dish must be amazing, I'll admit I didn't try it.  The poppers were really good, the salads taste like Olive Garden. (in a boring way)"
"Would have given them 0 Stars but it wasn't an option so one star was the very least available. I was told by the host that there was a wait  when there was visible seating available. Told I could go upstairs and find a seat but the staff upstairs said I had to speak to the host,which I had already done.. Confusion and no communication amongst the staff. Rude people working with customers, ridiculous. The pizza isn't at all worth the hassle!! Better off getting a Groupon cause Pequods sucks!!"
"Not a fan.  The crust is weird and it's not quite Chicago, not quite thin crust, just not quite anything to me.  My husband enjoyed it, but he's a simple man.  Appreciate their love for the Blackhawks but this pizza is for a specific customer... not for the masses."
"Decided to go lastnight, called ahead put name on list was told would be 45 minute wait at most. Get there they said 1 hr wait and we would be next party of 5 to be seated, check in because buzzers don't always work. We took our buzzer, came back in an hour checked in, was told a few tables ahead of us ( I questioned this and the guy was a jerk), so we waited, mean while 2 other party of 5 were seated (lil confused how we were next yet 2 other tables went ahead).  Finally after 1 1/2 hrs of waiting a girl came grabbed my arm said party of 5, I said yes she said follow me, we followed her to a table sat down got comfortable decided what to order next thing we know the guy (the jerk) comes back up to us says it wasn't our table and forced us to come down and wait again. No appology, nothing. Was so unorganized, unprofessional and RUDE treatment ever. I will NEVER eat there again. The sign on the was even stated call in advance you get half the wait time, Wait time was 2 hours we called and still waited OVER 1hr and 40 min. We left, never again! Pizza is not that good Lou Malnatis in Oak Park is WAY better. Better service, nicer staff and atmosphere!"
"Very disappointing.  Service was lousy.  Downstairs was half empty, but they marched us upstairs to be seated.  Then they realized that upstairs was full, so we went back down. Seated us at the bar, but then another worker said my son couldn't sit at the bar.  After we finally got to a table, it took them over an hour to bring us a small, thin crust cheese pizza.  Other tables that were seated twenty minutes after us got pizzas faster.  No apologies, no explanation other than that the waiter should have told us it could take 45 minutes for a pizza.  When we finally got it, the pizza was fine but nothing special.  For thin crust, the crust was too chewy.  We live in the neighborhood and have eaten here before, but doubt we will bother again."
"After all the hype, I was not impressed. We got take out, since I couldn't deal with the insane wait times. The pizza was fine, come on, it's pizza, but I've had better at other Chicago-style pizza places. It was slightly burnt, which overtook the whole flavor."
I was looking forward to this pizza after all of its positive reviews. So incredibly disappointed. The pizza was all dough and literally zero cheese. Its safe to say ill never eat here again.
"This place has great pizza, but the service is literally the worst I have ever experienced!  We waited over an hour and NEVER were seated!  Jimmy, the a**hole host, just kept seating people out of order, giving preference to his friends first!  He claimed these were people that called ahead for priority seating, but according to the giant sign on the wall, that cuts your waiting time in half. People on that list waited 15 minutes and got seated, while our party of 4 had to wait over 3 times that long!  Also, they had several tables waiting to be cleared for 15-20 minutes plus while they just sat around, not doing anything!  Seriously the worst experience ever. We left after over an hour of waiting and will never be back!"
"I was not impressed with this deep-dish pizza. The bread was super dense, and there was barely any cheese. Where are the proportions?!? The sauce was tasty (a little sweet, but no overwhelming). But again, it was as if I was eating toasted Italian bread. My deep dish experience at Giordano's was amazing (lots of bread, cheese, pepperoni, and sauce...equal proportions) and put this pie to shame."
"I was so excited to try this pizza after hearing some great things, but after this experience I will take my business elsewhere. I put in an order for delivery understanding that it would take a while on a Friday night, but after waiting an extra hour after the scheduled delivery I called to inquire. Apparently my order was taking too long so it was cancelled, but I was never contacted. There were no apologies, offers to place the order again, or attempts to help in general. I'm an extremely understanding person, but making mistakes and taking no steps to try to resolve the situation is unacceptable."
"service is horrible!!!! pizza is phenomenal!!! let's start with service. i get there just as shift change today on 4/23/2017 happens. we are sat on the second floor and start with a great server for five minutes and then get changed to martha. i warned them that when i have food in front of me, i go through my drinks quickly and to please keep up to my first waitress. i was told martha is taking over for shift change who will wait on my table there on........... no where in site!!! martha never comes. there is a waitress waiting on tables next to me who's attention i keep trying to get to first find our waitress and to please help fill my drink that's been dry now for a bit!! can""t get """"""""that"""""""" waitress to even look my way as much as i call to her!! finally, i scream at her!! she turns. i ask her who is martha and where is she??? surprise surprise,,, she is martha,,,, and she """"""""""knows"""""""" she is my waitress!!! she even tells me before i can say it that she knows to keep up with my drinks that she has so far failed in all of the above!!! she brings one drink that goes dry soon after and once again, can not get martha to come by!!! i am dressed fine!! engineer with my nephew eating out!! no service!!! manager comes by asking how's everything? i tell him all of the above to which he says,,, our waitresses here are not that good, they are bitches that back stabb each other all they time!! """"""""""""he literally says this!! no joke"""""""""""""". to which he adds in conversation, that he doesn't get along with most of them.... i wonder why!! maybe because you bad mouth them to your customers!! he also adds that your tips """"""""""never"""""""""" go to your waitress, it goes to a """"""""pot"""""""" that is shared by """"""""""all servers, cooks, bus boys"""""""""". hence, the bad service!!! a waitress there doesn't even have to try and she will be rewarded by the efforts of the rest of the staff!!!     with this said, the pizza is to die for!!! it is one of the best pizzas i've tasted growing up in chicago all my life loving and eating pizza. we ordered two large deep dish pizzas. they literally burn the edges of the cheese on the crust.... it is their thing!!! i like it, my wife peeled it off when i gave it to her at home.     now the manager talking with him, literally told me that he can not manage the crowds that come there and that patrons """"""""""""regularly do not leave tips!!!"""""""""",,,,,hmmm, i wonder why!?!? because service is horrible!!! get the menu and have it delivered or get a frozen or half cooked to go!!!!! good luck in getting good service or a manager that literally respects his women that work for him without calling them literally bitches!!!!"
"This review is specific to delivery.  Bad experience all-around.  First, pizza arrived 25 minutes later than they noted it would. I was asked if I wanted to pay when I ordered, or pay the driver ---- so I noted I would pay driver.  They failed to mention that was cash-only.  I didn't even think 2x that this might be the case, given options these days with the Square and other technology, So, that took another 10 minutes to resolve. And on top of it all, the pizza wasn't hot!!  Ugh, really wanted to like it, but it was just ok.  I might try eating in sometime - I'm sure that's a different experience."
"Bland pizza with a ""specialty"" of burnt crust. When I made pizzas, we tossed any that got burned. Now it's nostalgic? I'm sure Pequod stacks up well against Gino's East and Giordanos, but that's not saying much. Probably stacks up favorably to a Tombstone Pizza, too, but that doesn't make it good enough to put in my mouth when there are so many, better pizza options out there. Sure, I eat three meals a day but I'd still like to enjoy the eating experience each time. Why waste one here? Pass on Pequod's and you can thank me later."
"We called in the morning to request priority seating for a table for 2 at 7pm. We arrived promptly at 7 and were told to return in 20 minutes to get a pager. 20 minutes later, we picked up our pager and were told the wait would be around 1 hr. We came back 1 hour later and were told that there would be ""soon"", despite the fact that several parties behind us (without prior reservations) had already been seated at that time. 20 minutes later, we were told that there were still several parties ahead of us and it would be 30 MORE minutes, though I saw many parties behind us had already been seated in the interim. We finally gave up around 9:15pm (more than 2 hours after our reservation) and went somewhere else. It seems that this place is COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED and for the quality of their pizza, it's definitely NOT worth the 2+ hour wait. OVERRATED! Don't want to imagine what the wait time would be if we hadn't called ahead to put our names on the priority seating list..."
"Pequods is for people who want excessive amounts of bread and very little flavor. We ordered a $28 deep dish pizza and received barely ANY toppings on top of 2 INCH thick bread. literally 98% bread and the rest sauce and toppings.TINY bit of cheese, TINY bit of sauce, and almost no toppings. How nasty. If you want a $30 PIZZA BREAD order pequods.Waste of money."
"The service here has gone really down hill. They forgot our appetizers (we never got them), we had empty drinks for about an hour, and it took about an hour and 45 minutes for us to get our pizza from the time we ordered it."
"Went to Pequod's with high expectations after hearing so much buzz about their caramelized crust. Well, if you've never had it, here's the straight talk: caramelized crust = burnt cheese crust. They put extra cheese on the edge so that it ""caramelizes"" but it's not really a dark golden char, like maybe a grilled cheese would produce. It's burnt. As in black. As in potentially-cancer-inducing burnt. If you're into that, then this is your place. As for me, um, no thanks.Jet's Pizza is caramelized. Pequod's is burnt. Simple as that.What's more, one of our two pizzas had a burnt crust on the bottom. The servers didn't seem to care a lick about it. When we talked to the manager, he shrugged his shoulders and said the pizza happened to be in a hotter spot in the stove. OK. But we still don't like burnt-bottom-crust pizza. After some more (polite) discussion, the manager gave us a replacement pizza...but of course we had to wait another 20 minutes for it.On the plus side, there was a generous amount of sauce and the sausage had a nice flavor to it. But if burnt edge crust (and apparently burnt bottom crust too) is their signature, I'll pass and go back to Lou's or the original Uno's on Ohio Street."
"DONT expect delivery...much less a decent pizza.I waited 3 HOURS...NEVER AGAIN!Btw, turned them away at the door...cant believe they have a business."
"Their pan pizza is my favorite in Chicago.The young ladies that answer their phone are my least favorite.Lived in Chicago for 14 years and ordered from them for most of that. Pizza was consistently good and their attitude and phone manners were consistently terrible. They make it obvious that they don't want to talk to you and don't give a shit about what you want. They're so popular and busy it probably doesn't actually hurt them very much, but yeah.. be advised. Rudest bunch of dicks to ever pick up a telephone."
"After over a year of hearing tons of praises for Pequod's, I finally, finally made it out to the restaurant. Hyped up and ready to go, the line outside of the restaurant seemed like a good sign. ""Okay, cool, tons of people here, good atmosphere, this is a local favorite."" My group was told that it was a 40-45 minute wait.Once that time had passed, my friends and I noted that people who arrived after us were getting seated before us. Okay, fine, maybe they had reservations. We went in to check when our seated time was, and were told that we could actually order our pizza ahead of time, so that it would be ready much sooner after we were seated. We ordered a medium pan pizza (the caramelized crust was so hyped up!) with bell peppers and onions and went back outside to wait our turn. Over an hour had passed, so we went in; only after double-checking and seeing names after ours crossed out, we were immediately allowed in and seated.We were seated in one of their rooms upstairs, where there was an abundance of empty booths and tables - confusing as to why our wait time was so long. After notifying the server that we had already put our pizza order ahead, and ordering the appetizer combo (a great choice; really nice, hot breaded appetizers served with ranch and marinara - I'd say my favorites were the mushroom and zucchini), we began chatting, eagerly awaiting the main course. She came back out shortly afterwards and notified that she couldn't locate our order, and asked again what the name on it was. She double-checked in the kitchen, pulled out a receipt with our name to show us, and it turned out that while the pizza order was correct, several additional items had been added to the order. After further investigation, our pizza was discovered to have been sent to the wrong table. Long story short, we eventually got all of our food. As said before,the appetizers were timely and delicious. The pizza took an incredibly long time to be served, the ""caramelized"" crust was more of a burnt cheese fixture and the pizza itself was too saucy and cheesy. Nothing to write home about, but okay enough pizza. We received our check quickly and left.tl;dr the food was decent, though not worth the hype, and the service could definitely be more organized. A reasonably disappointing experience overall."
"I understand that they are busy due to the ""DePaul"" location. The front staff was efficient on a Sunday, but at some point you have to close the windows and TURN ON the AC ! This summer was super humid ! The pizza was average to me, but others' taste will vary. Overall I prefer the joint a few blocks up Ashland."
"Heard so much great things about the pizza hear so tried it out tonight. The wait wasn't bad. Sat down in about 20 mins. Order a cesar salad which was a cesar salad but 1 grape tomato, (watching out for that food cost) . We were told that the pizza will take about 45 mins. That's was understandable but it really was more like 1 hr and 20 mins. After tables around us, that we sat after us and got their pizza way before we did. When we got our pizza after waiting an hour and 20, it's was burnt. I mean I notice the style of the crust was that way but the whole bottom part was caked of a thick layer of burned crust. Sorry but that just killed the flavor or the whole pizza. I wasnt asked if we're satisfied with everything at all, not until I flipped all the slices over, and I believe a manager came by and asked if we're ok and If the kitchen was preparing another one for us. I said no. I asked for the bill right after I got my pizza sauce, which also took awhile (Understandable it's pizza that had to get heated up). But I asked for the bill right away. The server didn't even wonder why or asked if everything was ok. Not until I told her and showed her the pizza, She was nice enough to take it off the bill. By far it was a horrible experience. I hear nothing but good things about this place but maybe I'll try it again but not anytime soon. Recommend not go when it's too busy cause it seems accidents happen and pizzas  comes out burned"
With +2k reviews I thought we hit the jackpot with the perfect deep dish pizza. Unfortunately we didn't. It was ok. It maybe our fault as we added too many ingredients.. But Regardless.. It wasn't great. It was just a pizza. But will not give up on finding the perfect deep dish the next time I'm in town..but it won't be here.
"I ordered through Postmates, and called Peaquods because I had a question regarding my order, the young lady on the phone was so rude and hung up on me. I called my Postmates driver and had him call, he said she was extremely rude to him as well and didn't let him even finish speaking before she hung up. I called and spoke with the manager, she would not give me her name or the young lady who hung up on both of us. I cant understand how a company can be in business when the first point of contact is rude, abrupt and hangs up on customers. I ve never encountered a business that would not reveal the name of who you are currently speaking with. There are too many good pizza shops to encounter that type of service. Would be interested in hearing if others out there have encountered this type of service."
"Like captain Ahab, the irrational obsessions of the management get in the way of this place being nice to dine at. The argumentative staff that was heard screaming over the deafening music in the dining area. When we asked for some peace my party tried to eat the manager Rebecca came out and yelled at us to leave. We were so shocked that we could barely process this irrational and belligerent person in ""charge"". I don't know if the owners were taking a night off or something but they left the bitchiest person on staff in charge to drive people away. I'll never be back. I don't care how good the pizza is. There are a dozen different places with good pizza and courteous service. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid."
So disappointed. We recently hosted a party for out of towners and decided to have a pizza show down. We ordered Lou Malnatis (husbands favourite) and Pequods (my favourite) so that our guests could get the authentic experience. Well... Pequods pizza were burnt! Needless to say they lost the votes that night and my own too! We even informed the store about this friendly contest when we ordered. Next time - the husband will win the pizza order.
Awesome pizza! Lousy service. It took 20 minutes just for drinks on Thursday early evening then never came back to our table again except for delivering the check. Desert would've been nice after dinner if offered. Lost customer.
You food (pizza) was rancid! Reliving this experience has given me nightmares but I consider it my duty to warn my fellow Chicagoans of your putrid offerings. Don't order from this establishment if value your stomach! Pass it along!
"We had to wait for 2 hours for a burnt pizza. I am sorry, not recommended. And the beer tasted watered down."
"Color me saddened. Color me disappointed. Color this place overrated. I'm not going to argue with the Yelpers that have crowned this pizzeria. Everyone has their personal choice for pizza and suggesting what's best can be very personal. That said this pizza, for myself and 3 others, was wildly average. The thin crust is not worth your time to even consider. The crust is dry, insulted with excess cornmeal, and the sauce must have pulled a Houdini (disappearing act).  Really, really poor.  The deep dish does not measure to others in the city. Aficionados will quickly distinguish that a wait time of 45 minutes demands excellence - - this does not meet such a metric. As an aside, our dish took nearly 1:45 to create.  No bueno.  Service was actually awful, but I will chalk that up to a busy night. Otherwise, this rating would have received two stars. I recommend another choice... especially if from out of town and this is your one shot at a Chicago deep dish."
Lackluster pizza flavor.  There are so many better chicago style pizza places; try another one. Even touristy genos east is a better option.
"We called ahead to order deep dish pizza since it usually takes about 45 minutes to make. They typically cook it for 20-25 min before you come and then finish cooking it when you get there. We arrived at about 610 and were planning on seeing a movie next door at 715. We didn't get our pizza until 715 which meant they did not cook it before we got there. We clearly missed our movie. Moreover, our waitress was incredibly rude and avoided us knowing that we were getting inpatient. Lastly, we accidentally left our leftovers at the table and came back within 2 minutes;  the waitress said they had thrown it out already. Why did the quick service suddenly appear when we left?"
"Not for the food but the terrible service. After waiting 2 hours and 15 minutes, I was seated an hour after someone who was only waiting an hour.  When you're told, an hour wait... This is frustrating. The manager was kind but explained there could be lots of reasons for this OTHER than that his staff could have made a mistake.  I don't know or care if this crust is amazing. That's just arrogant and rude. Kudos to them, they have a hard job. But how can anyone improve if they don't think they have room to?!"
I don't see what the attraction is at all. The bread makes up 80% of the pizza. No thanks!
"I didn't enjoy this pizza. The crust was burnt (""carmelized"" my bum ) and there was more sauce than cheese or our toppings. Also, not that we needed alot of it, but this pizza was all bread (deep dish has cheese and toppings) that is like cardboard... burnt cardboard. Basically, we paid for lotsa burnt bread with Ragu sauce. Two stars just because they delivered."
"I love Pequods Pizza. Anytime someone comes to visit and asks to be taken to get ""Chicago Deep Dish"" I completely ignore their request and take them to Pequods because I love it and I know they will too.That makes this review all that more disappointing to write. I was having an NBA playoffs party this weekend and decided to order a large Pequods for this special occasion. I don't live super close to Pequods so I didn't mind that it took over an hour and a half for the pizza to get there. But the pizza that did arrive was badly misshapen, and cold. As we had been waiting for over an hour and a half, we each grabbed slices and began to eat before we realize that this was a plain cheese pizza we were eating, NOT the pizza we ordered. I called Peaquods to explain the problem. The manager was put on the phone and instead of apologizing,  angrily told me that because we had eaten slices, we would have to PAY for a new pizza to be delivered. When I pointed out that this didn't really make sense, as we had already waited a long time, and the mistake was theirs, she pointed out that ""if we sent you another pizza, then our owner would be out TWO pizzas"" .No apology, no attempt to make it right. Peaquods solution was that we should wait 3 hours for the right pizza and give them back the other pizza so that they could deliver it as well. I don't know what pizza place would be ok with sending a 3 hour old pizza that had been misdelivered and sitting in someone else's house for the night to customers that had been waiting and spending a good amount of money ($30 for one large pizza delivered) for a fresh hot pizza. The manager was beyond rude to me, and insisted that the only way they could get me the correct pizza, was to charge me for it, or have me accept a smaller pizza. We accepted the smaller pizza, and it did not arrive until Midnight, over 3 hours after we initially ordered. I have NEVER been treated so rudely or expected to not only wait on but PAY for a mistake that a restaurant made. I have eaten at Pequods about once a month for years, and as a coach, often take my sports teams there for end of season parties. I hate to say it because I love the pizza so much, but I don't think I'll be going back there again after being treated so poorly and rudely."
"Been waiting for over an hour for my personal pan pizza. 4 different tables have came, ate, and left already. This better be one hell of a pizza they are cooking!!!!"
"I've had better. I was excited to try this pizza, but was sooo disappointed! I had the deep dish pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. Carmelized crust was nothing special and speaking of crust...there was so much bread and not good bread either. I don't know how this dough is prepared but I'm not a fan. The reason I gave it 2 stars is there was a lot of sauce (which I like) and they were generous with the pepperoni and mushrooms. Go to Lou's or Giordanos...even though they are chain restaurants they still have great deep dish and thin crust pizza."
"Honestly, the pizza is not good. I've gone twice, and have been disappointed both times. The crust and sauce are entirely too sweet, and the dough is far too crispy for deep dish. The ambience, too, is really blah--generic sports decor. The only reason they got two stars and not one is because the lunch special is so cheap, making it a great choice for college students with low standards."
"This is more of a catch up review from last year.The girl friend at the time and I went to Pequods as a reference from her sister. Our first time there our pizza didn't taste very good, crust was cracked, and the waitress was rude. We figured that maybe it was just a busy night because every restaurant was swamped because of the Hawks game at the time so we tried a second time a week later. The food came out even worst the second time and looked almost inedible. When asked to replace or remake the food we received attitude/disgust from the waitress (not the same one) about it, and she even had the audacity to complain when we didn't leave a tip.Not sure if its because we ordered thin crust at a deep dish pizza place, but the now fiance and I both agreed we'd never go back to Pequods if given a choice again.Edit! Found the original review from last summer!My girl friend and I went here twice. The first time our food was drastically under cooked so we figured we give it a second time before making a final judgement on the establishment. The second time was worst. Our food had little to no sauce, disintegrated as we attempted to pick it up, and our waitress acted as if the work she was doing beneath her.Pequod's overall is your typical garbage college pizza bar with overpriced food, questionable quality of food, and horrendous service. If located anywhere else that wasn't a ""college town"" Pequod's wouldn't last more than a year before going out of business. Its a shame that ""today's youth"" find such a place desirable."
"WoW! First review ever, but stay away! They make you wait for a seat in an empty place. They wait you wait for the pizza that's burnt and not good at all. The crust is all dry, hard as a rock! Had both the pan and thin. Thin was to much dough not any good. What a waste of time. Don't see what people see in this place it's no Lou Malnati's! You want pan go there not here!"
"So I've ordered from them over the years.now granted their pizza is amazing and the service was great.but as of today I will probably never order from them again. we have waited over 2 hours for our food, I called back in a hour was told 20 mins.i waited 40 called back and they said it should have been here.i believe I talked to the manager which he was a little prick and was very shitty on the phone. He wanted to give us credit on our next order but I said I would probably never order again and I wanted our food for free, which I think is reasonable, he said in a shitty tone I'll just call the driver and cancel it.i said no that's ridiculous.so the out come is we are still waiting on our food which is going to be cold I'm sure and it's spouse to be discounted.but at this point we don't even want it..I NEVER YELP. But I am so disappointed in them I had to..FUCK THIS PLACE!"
"I don't understand this place. They serve pizza bread, it's not pizza. With so many amazing choices for incredible pizza in Chicago, I just don't get why people like Pequods."
"Let's put it out there, I LOVE PIZZA!!! OK, now that I got that taken care of, here's my humble review. I've always thought that food reviews are kind of a waste, since food is so subjective. Kinda like choosing a favorite color. If you like green, who am I to argue??? I really wanted to like Peaquod's pizza, but it wasn't in the cards. I placed a phone order for delivery, and almost 2 hours later, I get a phone call from the driver. He had the wrong address. Luckily it was only one digit off, so he was across the street. I brought the pizza (thin crust pepperoni) inside and opened the box. The pizza was barely warm, but the amount of pepperoni was very generous (the only reason I didn't rate a single star). Since it was in the drivers car so long, the crust was soggy. Maybe they're better (crispy crust?) if you order and eat in the restaurant....  After several bites, my disappointment began to ferment. It was extremely bland, totally lacking flavor. (No, my taste buds weren't on vacation). I'm used to pizzas with some seasoning, this was just crust, cheese, sauce and crust. No flavoring at all. I'm still going to to try their deep dish, the caramelized cheese looks enticing. But the combination of a long wait time and no payoff has me deeply disappointed.  I'll update after my next pizza, hopefully it will redeem Peaquod's. If not, Chicago is full of quality pizza joints, my money will be spent elsewhere.   Peace...."
"Note - this review is based on customer service, not product.  We ordered a pizza on a Friday night while packing up for a move and were told it would be a 1 1/2 hour wait.  After well over 2, I called and was told they had no record of the order.  After being transferred several times, I finally spoke to an unaccommodating manager who offered a forced apology only after I asked what was going to be done about the situation - as if she didn't believe we had even placed the order.  She said they could place the order again but it would be over an hour to receive.  They did, in fact, find the order later on as it was listed under an incorrect address and still all they offered in return for waiting 3 hours plus for a misplaced order was a free small salad.  The charge remained on my card for almost a week before being reversed.  I used to love Pequods so it was unfortunate to feel like our business wasn't valued.  We'll be ordering elsewhere from now on."
"Love the pizza. Seriously. Delicious. Customer service though? Woof. Twice now they've disappointed hard when I showed up with friends (lost reservations, rude host and waitstaff). I usually recommend everyone come here when they visit Chicago, but I'm not sure that's going to happen any more. May be time to explore new deep dish options!"
"This place has a fiercely loyal following that consider it the second-coming of ""Chicago-Style"" pizza. That said, having grown up in Chicago, I can remember the glory days of the great deep-dish restaurants: Uno's, Duo's, Gino's East, and Lou Malanati. In the 1970s, these were temples to the deep-dish style pizza that Chicago has unfortunately become known for. Today, Pequods has become the underground go-to place of a new generation.I ate there last week on the recommendation of someone I trust to know about good food and who has a deep appreciation for this place. Three adults and a 4 year old went to a late lunch on a weekday. The service was a bit slow and awkward. I am not sure if the server was new, inexperienced, snobby, or just lazy nor do I care. First ding to service.We ordered two deep fried appetizers: mushrooms and zucchini. We also order two bowls of soup as appetizers: minestrone type soup and a potato soup. The deep fried zucchini were straight from freezer burn to deep fryer burn and were simply awful. The mushrooms by comparison were also frozen but at least properly cooked. The potato soup was boring and odd. The other soup was actually good. The terrible tasting deep fried zucchini took an extraordinary amount of time to burn and bring to the table. Second ding to appetizers.The table had become quite cluttered with dishes, silverware, paper, etc. and the server simply ignored it and also refilling our drinks. Second ding to the server.We then had the lunch special of a small deep dish pizza with a drink for around $5.95. The pizza was more than enough food to satisfy even a large appetite, despite its relatively small size; it was very dense. Two pizzas came with pepperoni, one with mushrooms, and one with plain cheese. The pepperoni (meat itself) was good quality. The ring of the crust was burnt in a caramelized manner. Interesting and strange. The pizza was good in an addictive way. Each bite demanded another. Not being a deep-dish fan (Chicago has always been a thin crust town except for the tourists and suburbanites), I was surprised I ate it all. The pizza was about half as deep as a classic Chicago-Style and the ingredients were fresh. ,The bill was wrong and needed to be corrected which required actually getting up and finding the server. If there was a manager present, it wasn't apparent. To round off the experience, I was in the men's room with one of the waiters (they all wear the same shirt) who left the room without washing his hands. I swear this is true as shocking as it is.This place is not for me. Apparently, not for my wife either, who had indigestion for a day and a half."
"Pequod's used to be one of my favorite deep dish pizzeria, 10 years ago. However, the past 3 or more times, it was very disappointing. I've been embarrassed by recommending them for a company party and also when I had friends from NYC visiting, as I described Peqod's as one of the best. They used to be known for their deep dish pizza, but now it is just a thicker crust pizza with a little sauce and minimal cheese on top. It's a shame that such a previously good establishment is starting to skimp out and making what I used to have pride in as a huge mistake. After the past 3 times, I am sticking to Giordano's. Lou Malnati's is also skimping a little bit, but not as much as Peqods. Their deep dish is best described as an extra thick pizza dough with a little marinara, sausage, and cheese on top."
Pizza was good but we waited over an hour and :45 to eat. Not worth that kind of wait. Service was ok at best. Kitchen was SLOW and the management non-existent. Place was filthy dirty too. Maybe I'd consider take-out but will never again dine in. Gross restaurant with a filthy trash can in the open and near the kitchen/ restroom. Management needs a new team.
I ordered a pan cheese pizza for lunch was pretty good.  The crust was a bit breaddy. Overall not impressed.  So much competition.  Sauce was good not to greezoe. Not lous. Not art of pizza.
"I completely agree with Amanda's review.  This pizza was nothing special at all.  I'm surprised at all the rave reviews.  Sometimes a place just gets an image and that just lives on.  I totally don't see it in this case.If you're going to try Chicago style pizza, stick to Uno's on Ohio or at the least Lou Malnati's."
"This one star is for the service and lack of response I got when I shared my experience. The pizza is amazing so it makes me sad to share this. I wrote the below email to the Pequod's general email listed on their website. I have received NO RESPONSE, so I am posting to yelp. I am more disappointed in their lack of acknowledgement than the original bad experience. I probably won't ever go there again. Their pizza is good, but there is a lot of other good pizza in this city. Hi There,After my experience yesterday, 1/18, I feel compelled to write and let management know about the poor service that my party received.First of all, I want to be clear that the food was great, and neither myself or anyone else in my party of 4 had ever experienced poor service at Pequod's prior to this, even in circumstances where the restaurant was MUCH busier.  This is why I am writing to you, the company, directly instead of posting on Yelp.  I don't feel like my experience accurately reflects your restaurant as a whole, and that this was one unfortunate instance.We arrived around 3pm on Sunday, 1/18.  We were a party of 4, and two of us arrived about 10 minutes later than our friends.  We found our friends and discovered they were seated at a table at the very back of the restaurant that stuck out in the path of the staff's way to the kitchen.  This table should not exist.  The people on one side are uncomfortably close to the table of the booth behind them, and the people on the other side are in the path of the staff's way to the kitchen, and get run into, or accidentally bumped over and over again as people are rushing by.  Perhaps this table should be removed.We sat down, and our friends who had been there before us had drinks from the bar, but had not been attended to by a server, or offered water.  After several minutes, we had to flag down a server and ask to be served drinks.  My husband received his draft beer which he said tasted funny, as if the lines of the keg hadn't been cleaned recently.  He decided to drink it anyway, and did not complain.We ordered, and proceeded to wait at least 45 minutes for our pizza.  We didn't mind so much as we expected the pizza to take awhile, had good company, and were watching the football game.  What we did mind was that our server never took initiative to ask if we wanted more drinks, even though beer glasses stood empty for at least 15-20 minutes.  We then heard the table next to us ask about their pizza, as they had been waiting over ONE HOUR for their pizza.  We then noticed a booth open up and asked our server if we could switch to the booth in order to get out of this cramped and uncomfortable table.She said yes and kindly helped move us to the booth.  After we moved, my husband had to ask after about 10 minutes for the beer he had ordered at the other table. Our server said ""Oh yea!"" and went to fetch the beer.  After that we had no contact with our server for another hour.Someone else brought out our pizza.After that, no one stopped by our table to ask how it was, if we needed anything, to ask if we wanted anything else to drink, to clear our dirty plates, or anything in general.  We never ordered more drinks because no one stopped by to ask if we needed any.  The interesting thing is that there were plenty of people working there!  Kitchen staff, pizza runners, table bussers, bartenders.  There were at least 10 different people whizzing by us constantly but it was like we were invisible.  Myself and my friend both made eye contact with our server a couple of times hoping she would come over, but she never did.  At last we had to flag down our server to ask if we could pay. She looked surprised, then laughed and explained she thought we'd paid already, and that she'd forgotten that we'd moved tables, and that the ordering/billing system said our table was paid.  She said  we could've walked out of there and she would have never known we didn't pay!After she explained this, her lack of attention made a little bit of sense, but still didn't account for the fact she hadn't even asked us if we needed anything.  If a table sits there for an hour after you think they've paid, wouldn't it make sense to ask them if they had decided to order anything else? It was also odd to us for her not to remember moving a table in the middle of her shift.To make matters worse, she did not apologize, or even REALIZE that she had been ignoring us for an hour.  She just laughed, dropped off our check, and said have a nice day.  This was pathetic service, and therefore we left a pathetic tip.I looked for her name on the bill, but it wasn't listed.  She was a short woman with very short dark hair.  The purpose of this email is just to let management know what terrible service we were provided, especially in light of our normal good experiences we have a Pequod's, in hopes that you will address it appropriately.Thank you,Sara"
Owned by Burt of Burt's place before he sold it and opened in Morton Grove which is now closed. No clue why people like the odd carmelized (burnt) ring of crust on the outside. Pizza is ok but incredibly greasy with any meat topping.
Could be a good pizza but very bad service! we had a reservation and they had us waiting for an hour and a half! Rediculous! Find another pizza place.
"The other hyped Chicago eatery that just doesn't measure up.A problem that I've had with Chicago deep dish is the fact that there is always a tremendous amount of food, but the quality just isn't there. My weapon of choice was sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese (a standard for every new pizzaria I try). It wasn't bad, but once again there was a lot of stuff and nothing stood out. The sausage was missing and tasted cheap, the pepperoni lifeless and when it comes to the cheese my friend said it the best when I told him there was extra cheese; ""oh extra cheese? I didn't even think there was any on there!""This was not because it was lacking(IMO I considered it only enough for a normal order), but because it had no flavor. The crust is a more crumbly recipe, rather than the more traditional doey. I didn't mind the texture, but it was too thick in comparison to everything else and lacked personality. The sauce, as with the theme with everything else. was plain and boring.This was actually probably the pizza I enjoyed the least in Chicago, despite supposedly being the best. I literally DREADED finishing the pizza I bought. Never before have I looked at a pizza and thought ""I never want to touch this again:. If I ever try Pequods again, I'll try some fresh ingredients. But I doubt anything will change."
"Some friends were raving about how awesome the pizza here is so I got some to go. IT'S NOT DEEP DISH PIZZA! It's basically pizza bread with too much sauce that's just meh, and a beautifully caramelized crust with minimal cheese.  Super disappointing."
"Really? Again? We tried it once. We really tried. Mostly bread, burnt(not caramelized) crust. It was a Saturday night, so we gave them a pass and tried again on a weeknight. NOPE. Still black, not brown cheese."
I didn't like this as much as I anticipated.  I ordered a large cheese deep dish and it certainly wasn't bad but it didn't really tickle my fancy either.  I prefer a denser crust and a brighter/fresher tasting sauce (i.e. still has the bite from fresh tomatoes).  This pie has a very light crust that is more bread-like than crust like and the sauce is a low and slow cooked sauce that is heavy on the oregano.  The kind of sauce that is better suited for pasta than pizza.  Obviously this is just my opinion and it seems that a lot of people really love this stuff so I am in the minority but if you have similar tastes as I do you may be a bit disappointed as well.
its really not that good. lous is way better
"Full disclosure: this review is about Pequod's thin crust pizza only. I ordered my first pizza from Pequod's for delivery the other night, and I was very disappointed. Yes, it was slightly different than other Chicago pizzas. The crust was very bready, soft and somewhat spongy. Very pale and lightly cooked. Big thick edge, which added even more unwanted breadiness. The toppings were ample, and of decent quality. The cheese was hardly brown at all. Very little sauce. The whole thing was limp and soggy. Not a good experience. Will not order from here again."
Make sure you reserve about 2 hours to eat there.  I ordered cheese bread and a small deep dish pizza.  The bread came an hour later and pizza followed 1 hour and 15 minutes after the ordered was placed.  Wait was much more than I expected.
"Relative newbie to Pequod's though long time Chicago resident and pizza fan. I like all styles of pizza and often seek the local favorites when traveling. Pequod's pizza is good. Good enough that I wanted to come back and try it a month later. On my second trip, I was disappointed. Not by the pizza, for we never got a table. The wait was 60 minutes at 10:00 on a Saturday. What struck me is how much of a dive the place really is. Dingy, dirty, cramped and generally run down. Not what you'd expect from a popular place. The bathrooms are a disaster of ancient plumbing and water leaking on the floor. I hope it was only water. Pequod's is not kitschy or old school or hip, it's just tired, very tired. Even the bar looks forlorn and obviously neglected with cheap decorations and unstocked shelves. I'm sure the owners make a mint on the place. But they sure don't spend a dime making it nice, clean and modern. Fire trap comes to mind. But the pizza is still good. Just not good enough to endure the building and environs."
"Don't believe the hype. After reading and hearing great things about this place, I had to try it on my recent visit to Chicago. We waited almost an hour for a table for 5 and an additional hour for the pizza. Their basic pizza is just cheese, so we added pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and peppers. The pizza is ALL CRUST! I mean 80% BREAD and a sprinkle of toppings. Their famous caramelized crust is just soft, chewy burnt cheese. The crust was super soft and the sauce had no flavor. I was thoroughly disappointed. IMO, the pizza was NOT a traditional Chicago deep dish. I'll stick to Lou's next time. Service was also super slow and drinks are weak."
Never gonna come here again!they told me pizza is gonna be ready in 15 mims and was waiting more than 1 hour!
"Horrible customer service! From the hostess, to the waitresses, to the managers. We come from out of town to eat here, and the last time we went the hostess wanted to split my party of 20 up, and avoid our reservation upstairs because they were ""closing"" come to find out when we finally made our way upstairs and we're getting seated we saw multiple employees sitting down in booths eating and drinking. Their was also lots of other people up there eating as well. An hour and a half goes by and half of there staff gives us attitude, with dirty stares and talking under there breath.. And our waiter even spilled water on two people at our table. Minutes later four of there girl employees start talking crap to us, mind you they were drunk. Where's the manager?!! He came, sent them home.. That was it! Ridiculous. Never again. GREAT PIZZA. But.... Their staff needs a serious attitude adjustment!"
"I'm with Jannice C.  Just not getting it.  I'd say 2.5 if I could.  Not worth rounding up though.  Not on par with Lou's, Gino's East, Giordano's --- just not.  I expected more from the crust...which looked great and sounded stellar per reviews...but it disappointed in person.  Kind of a solid vibe to the place, friendly service to boot---but not a fan of the product."
"This place is so over rated.  Went there with my husband one night since hearing all the hype about how great their pizza is.  We went on a weekend so it was busy.  The place is much bigger than it looks.  We were seated upstairs.  Very dirty and grimey restaurant.  Bathrooms were even more disgusting.  We got their ""famous"" deep dish and although the carmelized cheese is delicious, the dough was thick and soggy and not that great.  Personally, I prefer Lou Malnati's deep dish or even JET'S crispy corner pizza over Pequods."
"Good pizza, slow, noisy, douche ownerWent to Pequod's for pizza last week.  To start, the pizza is good, 8.5 out of 10.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, I give them a 9.However it took 1:20 to get the pizza from the time we ordered it, and we pre-ordered it.  Way too long.  We were seated upstairs, where I wouldn't go again  even if I was told there was a pot of gold up there.  This is where the wait staff dumps dishes and silverware from cleared tables.  It's also where they like to seat groups.  Because of the background noise, the people at large tables can only hear each other when they yell at each other.  This only adds to the noise, with people at every table yelling and screaming at each other just to be heard.  It's awful, just awful. If you must go, avoid upstairs and especially the back room like the plague.The first sign that the 60 something owner is a kind of a douche is that he has a pony tail to the middle of his back.  Now, I don't really hold that against him, but it starts to paint a picture.  He likes pro hockey, and I appreciate that.  However, he insists that every TV be tuned to pro hockey.  The night we were there, 4-0 Northwestern was playing at home against 5-0 Ohio State, perhaps NW's biggest home game in 10 years.  He refused to turn just one of the seven tv's off hockey to the NW game.  And even after the first period of hockey was over and there was 18 minutes of intermission advertising, he refused to turn just one tv to football during the intermission.  Douche.  Now remember, each NHL team plays 82 regular season games each year.  He can't change one tv just once, even during intermission?There are a couple of other very good pizza places within two miles of Pequods.   Considering the wait after ordering, the unbearable noise, and an owner who could care less about customer service, I will not be eating at Pequod's again.  If you must have their pizza, order it to go."
"Too much bread. It's like a cross between focaccia bread & pizza. I prefer thin crust pizza or a deep dish that is all cheese, so this was not my cup of tea, or more accurately, not my slice of pizza."
Catie was rude wanted us to order food all we wanted was a stuff pizza but we will never come back again!!!! Thanks for your business! !!
"Many of us can probably agree that drinking quite a few alcoholic beverages prior to eating can make mediocre food taste like victuals from a feast of Hedone. However, an odd occurrence took place when I ate at Pequod's. Even with more than 4 glasses of wines swishing around inside of me, I did not find Pequod's version of deep dish pizza worthy of my palate. All you lovers of this faux deep dish can get mad if you want. I don't like it. I don't like the thin flavorless sauce, the way the toppings seem to be lackadaisically thrown into a heap atop of it all (Ingredients are supposed to be inside of a deep dish. In.... Side.), or the cheese. The crust; let's talk about it. At first, when I shared my underwhelment (I made it up) of this pizza, I was told I should have had the caramelized crust. Upon checking with my friend who brought me here, I learned that I, indeed, had had the caramelized crust. Caramelized, seared, lightly whipped.... whatever the crust has to be in order to taste good, it is not. If a pizza tastes like this to me after that much wine, and while seriously hungry, I'd hate to consume it while sober. This is a transplant's deep dish, in my opinion. And when I really think about, that is mainly what has recommended this pizza to me; transplants. I ought to know better."
"After a NYE debacle, ending with a credit towards another pizza and salad, I ordered again on a normal week night to see if Pequod's could redeem themselves. They did not and I will never order from here agin. The pizza just wasn't that good, overpriced and not that hot when delivered."
"I'm embarrassed that I have recommended this place for so long. The staff is beyond incompetent-there are no words for this level of ""service"". I've worked in this industry for many years, I've hosted, I've run food, I've served, I've managed. I understand the other side of dining out and this was just a total let down. The wait, long. I understand that. I recommend this place to my boyfriends father who was excited to try deep dish which Chicagoans don't actually eat, but I always made an exception for Pequods. I used to love this place. 2.5 hrs later and multiple times of them telling our party ""10 more minutes"" I was absolutely finished and over this place. 1 six top, 2 four tops and 1 three top got seated before our party of 3; all of which arrived AFTER us and it's incredible that the hosts were not phased by this. ""Maybe they called ahead"", really? Yeah. Maybe they all called ahead and decided to show up 2 hours before the quote time just to hang out. F*cking doubtful. Maybe if I hadn't worked in this industry so long I'd believe you, nice try. But I don't buy it babe. Is the pizza good, yes. Would I ever go through this again? F*CK NO. Screw this place."
"5 star pizza, 1 star service. The pizza is absolutely awesome, that said the service here is down right despicable. Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders, to the servers are just rude and exhibit very little interest in the people that are spending their hard earned money to eat at this establishment. I really hope that they can get it together on the service side of things because the pizza is that good. I would recommend that if you are going to get pizza here order takeout, so you don't have to deal with the people keeping this place running."
"Unimpressive. Lacking in flavor, poor salad, wings, etc. If you like really sweet sauce you might tack an extra star on. Read more about it at the link.fooddewd.tumblr.com"
"The deep dish was ok but not worth the 1 1/2 hour wait. Good and flavorful sausage chunks, yummy airy crunchy crust (like Lou Malnati's) but not into the burnt edges, and mediocre sauce that lacks flavor. It is overrated and I still prefer Lou's. Can't say I will be back with a wait like that."
"We had their pizza for the first time last night and we weren't too impressed.  I thought it was lacking sauce and my husband thought it was lacking cheese.  The toppings we chose were  giardiniera and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very good but the giardiniera was mostly jalapeños and a little bland.  While the pizza was edible the service was soooooo terrible.  We ended up just ordering from the bar bc a waitress never did come.  In my opinion, oven grinders is the best pizza in the city."
"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant. The customer service was terrible. I ordered delivery and had to repeat myself and spell everything out, which I was fine with to assure I got my food even though my address was not very difficult. I initially told my address the first time to see if we were located within the delivery zone. I waited the 1.5 hours that was quoted and still had not received it so I called. They had me repeat my address again multiple times and said it was out for delivery and would be here in 5-10 minutes... the time went  by and it still hadn't arrived... My boy friend called again and they said they had no record of the order.. then when asked to speak to a manager continuously put him on hold and did not put a manager on. Finally a manager came on again asking for the address and then said that the phone number and address were both wrong and that is why we didn't get our pizza. The manager did not even apologize. I would not recommend this place. The next battle will be getting my money back."
So do not get the obsession with this place. I have had much better slices of pizza. I think it's not them it's me. I prefer thinner less greasy pizza.  Also I did pick up. Maybe the experience of eating there makes it better
"I went today with a coworker to have pizza for lunch. We were both in the mood for pizza and we decided to come to Pequods for their lunch special. When we got there the place was EMPTY and this made us happy because it meant that we were not going to have to wait as long.35 minutes pass by and nothing. No pizza, the server didn't come once to refill our drinks. We decided to leave, we had to be at work in 5 mins and it took us 20 minutes to get there because of traffic. So my advice is if you don't have more than an hour to waste then don't go here apparently it takes the same time to prepare a 7' pizza than it does a 12' deep dish.Pizza is great don't get me wrong it among my favorites, this review is for the service we received."
"This pizza place was on several ""best pizza places"" to eat in the Chicagoland area.    I was eager to try as I truly love pizza.   Well, I give this place 1 star only.   The pizaa was bland and not seasoned well, needed more sausages, and the crust tasted like thick bread.   I thoroughly enjoy places like Lou Malnati and Uno's pizza.   This pizza place compares to Domino and Papa John.    Definitely not good pizza.   Try another location."
"I went here because I've heard nothing but good things, but was extremely disappointed. We ordered delivery, which took 2 hours, I was fine with that even though it seemed excessive to wait that long. It looked like it would taste amazing, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Maybe it was an off night, but I'll never know because I will definitely not be going back to Pequod's."
"For the pizza, I'd give a hesitant 3, for everything else, I'm livid.I booked a table in advance knowing that it'd be packed and we had reservations to get to afterwards.  I did not realize that booking a table just reduces your wait time.  Pequod's PLEASE make it clearer on your reservation page that this isn't a ""reservation"" so much as a ""wait time reduction.""We took seats at the bar so we could avoid the wait time we didn't expect.  We were told the pizza would take about 45 minutes to an hour to come out.  An hour and 40 minutes later we were scarfing it down to be able to get to our show on time.  Absolutely no one was keeping us updated as to what the hell happened to our food.  We even pre-paid just to be able to walk out a tiny bit faster.To boot, we were told a small plus a medium would be ""just right"" for 4 people.  For real?  We ended up handing half of the pie to some lucky guy on the street just so we didn't feel it was totally wasted.I wanted to love this and really could not have been more heartbroken."
Not very great.Pizza pie was bland
"Pequod's is for people who like bread. We ordered a large topping pizza. They were VERY generous with the toppings. I really liked that about the pizza. The carmalization ROCKED. Pequod has really made themselves a signature with that. Seriously, it's worth a try. However, I have yet to find a pizza place on the north side (and I'm a northsider) that is better than the southside and that sucks because my husband is a southsider and BRAGS about the pizza quality of the south side. The crust is a deal breaker for me. This crust was more breadlike with no flavor. If I were asked to improve the crust, I would make it a garlic butter crust. It was too much bread for us at the bottom of the pizza and not enough flavor. So, if you're a fan of a ""breadlike"" crust, then this is the place for you. We are not bread crust fans. By ""bread"", I mean that the consistency seemed like the pizza ingredients were sitting on top of a piece of bread. I wanted to LOVE this place, but it's just not for us."
"BEWARE!!! They use the term ""Deep Dish"" but it is in fact only a Pan Pizza. Deep Dish is an entirely different pizza and what we thought we were buying. We asked if it was Deep Dish and not just Pan Pizza and were given the affirmative that it was Deep Dish. OK, so disappointment aside, how does it rate? Crust too thick and dry. Minimal cheese put on top of that and then the sauce. It needs the sauce on the crust to help it out. Ingredients on top of sauce. Sauce was good. Not going to recommend this though because we've had much better Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut!"
"Ok, here's my ""Remembrance of Things Past:"" This place was once so loud it was painful. It was also as dark as sin. That's 50/50 for me. Meanwhile, the pizza was excellent. I'll take it, statistics be damned. Now? It's, as they say, family friendly; ie: neither an aural nor visual extreme. Pizza's still good, but I can find this ambience at...oh, I don't know...Olive Garden, or Domino's. And I can find good pizza at any number of places as well (Lou Malnati's comes to mind.)  Pequod's does not produce such a singular product that I cannot consider other options, and what made them unique is now gone, by their choice. So  it goes."
I have been to pequods a few times in my life and have been satisfied for the most part.  I had not been there in about four months though.  I have been raving about it to my girlfriend whom has never been so I took her tonight.  The staff was horrible! Right from the two hostes the rudeness began.  I don't get what there problem was but they were pretty pissed I said we would wait for a booth.  They really made sure we felt u comfortable about that.  Then when we did get seated our waitress was just as mad and rude to us as well.  She must of asked the table next to us if they were ok four times and we did not get asked once.  Our drinks and food were slammed down on our table as if she had a personal problem with us.  It was extremely uncomfortable.  The pizza and wings of course were delicious but the service really killed it.  I can honestly say I don't think I would ever go back to this location.  I have not felt uncomfortable like this in a restaurant in a long time.
"Don't believe the hype. I was bamboozled by the good reviews for this place. I ordered a medium deep dish cheese yesterday which cost a little over $18 with delivery. The crust was VERY  thick and doughy, with too much sauce. I was amazed especially by how little cheese there was on the pizza- I mean veerry little. I've never really been a fan of deep dish pizza because it is too much cheese, but this pizza I don't even think you can classify as deep dish at all. Save your money."
"Stopped here for two take pieces of sausage pizza and a soda.  I waited in the car and the boyfriend ran in.  Well, he was in there for 20 minutes and the place wasn't overly crowded.  When he finally came back to the car, the pizza was so overheated, you couldn't even tell there were two pieces.  The cheese was a melted blob and no one could we pick them up off the cardboard plate they were on since it was stuck.  The taste of the pizza and sausage was really good, but we ended up having to pull it apart in pieces since we'd didn't have tableware in the car.  The bottom crust was kinda wimpy and not crisp at all.  The food tasted good, but the ability to eat a slice on the go was impossible."
"Rather than cast another vote into the ""which deep dish is better?"" debate, I'll focus here on our experience at Pequod's, which wasn't remotely good. We went early on a Sunday evening--two hours after the Bears game had ended, so that's not even a valid excuse--and ordered two personal pizzas, two beers. That's it--not an especially complicated order. The place was lively, not what I'd call busy, and yet 75 MINUTES LATER our food still hadn't arrived and our inattentive server hadn't bothered to check in with us even a single time. I understand that deep dish takes a while longer to cook than thin crust, but seriously, there is no earthly reason for a pair of 7"" pizzas to require that much time. I appreciated the charred cheese and the savory sauce on the pizza that finally arrived, but it hardly made up for the wait or the poor service."
"I had to sign up just for this one! After waiting 2 hours for a half peperoni pan pizza, I open it up and it is cooked crisply. The bottom was half black and the peperoni crumbled to little pieces when you touched it (photos below). So once I got a hold of someone, the girl said it is supposed to be black around the edges. I said yeah, well its much more than that! To her credit she said she could give me a credit for next time or get a manger. I asked for a manger because I wanted half my money back, because I know they tried and I thought that would be fair. Well I sat on the phone with the manager, who did not believe me and said just like the girl, it is supposed to be black around the edges and some black spots on the bottom. I'm in Chicago, I think I have a good idea of what a pan pizza is supposed to look like! So, after ten minutes, oh and sending the manager a picture because he did not believe me, he finally said yeah it's over cooked! He continued to say we can send another, I said that's ok, I'm not ordering here again! Pequod's was recommended to me by a friend, not sure if we will be friends after I tried this burnt pizza! I don't know what's worse, that the manager didn't believe me or that they even let this pizza leave the store and get to my house!  I have had a pizza that wasn't right from other pizzeria's and they didn't question it, they took care of it immediately.  Going to keep with the other great pizza joints in Chicago like, LOU MALNATI'S, PIZZANO'S, AND PIECE PIZZA. this pizza went in the garbage, just like the managers customer service!  I hope you can keep them on the phone long enough to send them a picture of your burnt pizza!"
"I know folks really love this place, but I think we've experienced a much tastier pizza, honestly.   Our party of six came here on Jan20. There were 4 first timers in the group.  The wine list is pretty poor, and the selections were below average, as we tried a few samples at the bar before we chose our bottle.   The Caesar salad was just meh...nothing done to make it stand out - just average or so. As far as the pizza, we ordered two pan-styles: a pepperoni and mushroom, and a sausage, spinach, garlic and mushroom.  If the sauce had flavor, it would have been great, but we found that the sauce was too ketchup-like...like just an institutional canned variety off a food supply truck.   It didn't stand out to compliment the ingredients.  So...this being said, I think this is just our one time shot here."
"First off...let me say...as far as deep dish goes?  5 stars...my favorite in Chicago.  Here is why I'm giving it 2 stars, and just as a warning to other potential customers...They have a delivery map online with a quote that says ""Our delivery range covers most of north Chicago but if you live near the fringe call and see if we can make it to you, we are accustomed to making reasonable exceptions.""  It also states an additional $1.00 delivery charge for that.  No big deal.  I live 2 blocks north of the cutoff.  I was told that they could not deliver there.  She checked with a manager and said ""no"".  Normally, this wouldn't be a big issue, except it specifically states that if you live ""near the fringe""...which I consider 2 blocks to be...they are ""accustomed to making reasonable exceptions.""It's unfortunate because it takes an additional 30 seconds, which I would easily tip extra for.  They have lost a consistent delivery customer as a result, and has left a bad taste in my mouth for a place I otherwise drooled over."
"Honestly these people are so rude it's unbelievable and really disappointing. Their food is decent but their customer service is probably THE WORST I have ever experienced. I've been twice and both times have been a HUGE disappointment as far as service. Get your act together pequad jerks, you're not that great to be acting the way you do. #getoveryourself"
"If I was rating their Pizza, I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, their service really brings the place down. I've went and eaten here a few times, but after being lied to about wait times for tables and food on numerous occasions, only to have the food order screwed up. I really don't care about a long wait (it's a popular place), but just tell me the truth and bring out the food as it was ordered and I won't be upset. Most recently I decided to forego that experience and order delivery. Pizza is still great, but they still manage to screw something up. Most recently I had them repeat the order to me, even then they still manage to forget a salad and an ingredient on the pizza. As I've said a few times, the pizza is good, but there is A LOT of really good pizza in Chicago. Save yourself the pain of Pequod's and get one of the others."
"Pequod's kicked off the first round of the ""Pizza Challenge"" at my place of work, and the general consensus was that this restaurant should either come in dead last or should not even qualify for competition.The Deep Dish pizza was about 90% bread, which might have been acceptable if they hadn't forgotten to include flavor.  The thin layer of cheese and sauce weren't much of an improvement, and the ""caramelized"" (see also: burnt) cheese at the edge of the crust only served as the final nail in the coffin.Really, this was about a half step above Pizza Hut.  If eating a burnt loaf of stale bread with a little sauce and cheese thrown on top is your thing, then please knock yourself out at Pequod's.  I will pass, as will most of my coworkers.For what it's worth, this was delivery.  I can't speak about the dining experience at the restaurant itself."
"Pizza is fantastic and can't be beat. But...when a regular customer calls and orders for pickup, don't tell them it'll be 40 minutes if it's really going to be an hour and a half. And when you screw up, at least offer your ""valued customer"" a beer while they wait or % off their order...that's just good business. Very disappointing"
"Straight up I cannot recall liking a pizza less, which says a lot because I don't like a lot of pizza. We had thin crust -- I realize this isn't their ""thing"" but it's not that hard to make a good thin crust cheese pizza.  The crust itself was so completely tasteless -- like it was just flour and water. Not even salted, no pinch of sugar to get the yeast pumping. Just mixed bleached flour mixed with water and baked. The amount of cheese put on the pizza was insulting -- gobs and gobs of flavorless LMPS mozzarella.  I don't mind a lot of cheese, but if it tastes like rubber, I'll pass.The little bit of sauce under the cheese was pretty tasty, but not enough of it and hardly making up for the rest of this wretched pizzaService wise, we ordered for pickup, arrived 5 min after the time they said to come, had to push through a crows to find someone to talk to and then waited nearly 15 more minutes."
"The manager came over, she was a blonde bimbo. Katie was her name, she was wearing really short shorts. Super inappropriate! The pizza was mediocre."
"Well....my boyfriend and I stopped in here, prompted by the plentiful Yelp reviews and high rating as we passed through Chicago on our way from NYC to rural IL for a wedding.We ordered two salads and a small deep dish pizza with black olives to split. The salad was hard to eat. The lettuce was tough and tasted very bitter.The pizza...was disappointing. Granted we are used to thin crust pizza(I am a waitress in a place that serves amazing brick oven thin crust pizza) or the thinner crust regular NYC style pies, but the thing that bothered me about this pizza was that the crust, like the part under the cheese and sauce I mean, was very sweet. I also felt that there was a ton of cheese on the pie and not that much sauce. The one very good thing about this pizza was the outside crust. The cheese and bread caramelized to form this amazingly tasty crunchy ring around it. I wish the whole pizza tasted that irresistible!Service was unwelcoming. There were college kids working there and the hostess rolled her eyes a lot and they huddled in the corner chatting and eating cereal from a ziplock bag while leaning all over the bar and looking generally miserable and unenthused- the kind of behavior that would get me in trouble at any of the places I worked."
This deep dish pizza is super bready and not so cheesy.  It reminded me of a slightly worse personal pan at Pizza Hut.
"The service here is good. The pizza here is terrible. Someone told me it would blow away Malnati's. We are no longer friends. We ordered a deep dish with sausage, mushrooms and onion. The crust was burnt, and it overwhelmed the toppings. If I wanted pizza bread, I would order pizza bread. Don't waste your calories here, people.  Malnati's wins hands down."
"Pizza is hands down the best deep dish in Chicago (as long as extra sauce is added), HOWEVER the service is consistently severely lacking.  Tonight, the to go staff was disorganized beyond belief.  With friends visiting from out of town, we didn't mind waiting the 1 hr 45 minute quote time to pick up our pizza.  It was the 32 minutes from arriving at Peaquods until walking out the door with our pizza while my visiting friend and his child sat in the car that was unacceptable.    Our experience was not unique - the person next to me was waiting for over 45 minutes.  The deep dish is delicious, but the service will leave a  bitter taste in your mouth."
"Food is great, and order here often. However, the last time I ordered I had someone who seemed very disgruntled while placing my order. I know they were busy, but acted very rude. At the end of the order I was saying thank you and before the -thank- came out of my mouth, they hung up on me."
"Yes. People say this is the real deal. The best. The awesome. But, in fact, this is a trap.I had to wait more than one hour to be seated -- despite the fact that we called to make reservation and the host said it would take only 30 minutes.After seated, the waitress informed us that it would take at least one hour for our pizza to be ready. The pizza is no different from other places in Chicago. Waiting two hours to eat a regular pizza. Really?"
"LATE REVIEW:  I tried this place a few months back with my girlfriend, who along with several of her co- workers, raved about the pizza.  We decided to dine in, and that's when dinner took a horrible turn.  Our server seemed very preoccupied with the other tables which seemed to be a good sign until we quickly noticed that group didn't include our table.  After a long wait for a menus, we finally got some love.  Within roughly two minutes, our server returns asking what we want to order.  She was a bit about it.  I said we'd need another moment as this was my first visit.  She returns after a while and we're ready, order the pie, and she  immediately walks away.  We didn't even get the chance to order drinks before we vanished. We get her attention after a few more minutes and informed her we wanted beverages too(usually servers ask).  No hey sorry about that, nothing.  I realize that place was busy, but she gave me the impression that we were inconveniencing her.  At this point I say to my girlfriend, ""if the service is normally this terrible, the food must be exceptionally good.""  I lose again.  Their famous deep dish I had heard so much about left so much to be desired.  I can only conclude most of their patrons are not native Chicagoans.  It even took way too long to get the check.  She just averted her eyes from us.  I don't get it.  Worse part of all is I spent 50 bucks a meal that was not only mediocre, but we were treated almost like we weren't welcome their.  I paid and left quietly.  I feel like the owner of this place stole from me.  I curious to know what qualifies one to get decent service here,  as it appearing others were recieving.  Its a win win, I never have to eat there again, and they get to keep my money anyway.  Screw one customer, it won't hurt business."
"Wow, I can't believe I'm updating this again, and dropping more stars.  A couple of nights ago we ordered a deep dish pizza for delivery.  Things were bad from the start.  The person who took our order didn't repeat it back to my husband.  We ended up with a medium pizza, instead of the large we ordered.  However, in their favor, they charged us the price of a medium.  Things were even worse once we opened up the box.The pizza arrived within the 1 hour we were quoted.  However, the pizza was stone cold, and it also looked like it had been dropped.  The crust had fallen off many of the pieces, and some of the toppings had completely slid off the pizza.  It was so cold, we had to cook it in the oven for about 12 minutes to get it to a good temperature.  It was very bland, and basically we felt like the kitchen staff half-assed it.When I called to complain, the manager decided to only charge us half price, and put a credit back on our card.I hate to say it, but the inconsistency of Pequod's will definitely make me hesitate before I order from them again.  We've now had several mediocre deep  pizzas with a only few great ones sprinkled amongst the pizzas we've had delivered from Pequod's over the past year or so.  Something has definitely changed, and not for the better."
"Pequods pizza rocks but their customer service stinks!  When you go there to eat, it takes FOREVER, and when you order, it's not much better.  I've been waiting over 1:15 for my 1 pizza.....it's crazy!  When I called to check on the pizza, the girl snapped at me on the phone.  Whatever.I like the pizza a lot, but I'm going to rethink them next time I'm ordering."
"So let me set the record straight...this is by far one of the best pizza places in this damn beautiful city. I love this place.  I eat here probably 3 to 4 times a month.  this pizza is GREAT! With that being said I am so unbelievably irritated by the 16 year olds running the front door. My goodness I came in at 7 pm called ahead of time I understood it was a two hour wait.  This was no surprise,  a place like this I would expect nothing less.  The problem here is I talked this place up to my family for a few days, they were in town visiting....So anyway I walked in at 7 pm they said the wait is two hours.  So I explained to the kids up front running wait list I get the wait is two hours we would like to put our name on the list well be back at 9pm. They put our name on the list...great.... Two hours later we get there at 9pm on the dot.  I get they don't take reservations. Any who, the same kid that took my name down I tell him hey bud we put our name on the list at 7pm we decided we would go down the street to a bar instead of scratch myself on the sidewalk for two hours.....This kids with a big ole smirk on his face tells me is gonna be another hour wait and we're checked in at 9pm....wait is 50 mins........what?! I explain to the kid (s) didn't you say it was a two hour wait at 7pm and you TOOK THE NAME DOWN AT 7PM! Not one crap given, instead I got this 16 year old giving me a huge smirk right to my face and making jokes to his coworkers like I was the bleeping pinata....then went on to respectively run his mouth....the point being, teach your employees to represent your business with respect. That's the crap the loses business and gets your clientele talking poor about your business.  Fix it. 5stars for pizza, 1 star for service."
Not worth the wait!   Called in the morning to get a preferred seating time.   Arrived 1.5 hours before out time hoping to get in a little early.  Waited over two hours to get in even though people off the street were getting in before us.  Inquired a number of times about our wait and was given one excuse after another why our calling ahead did not guarantee a time.  At one point I even saw the list with names after ours crossed off as being seated.  Still remained patient thinking the food would be worth the wait.   Their famous Chicago deep dish pizza was anything but.  There are many other places in Chicago for a pizza.  Do not waste your time with Pequods.
Typically a fan. Word of advice don't order a pizza on the saturday before st Patricks day. They are rude and make excuses. Great pizza. Horrible employees.
"Just ate here for our first time after hearing  a lot of hype about the place... NOT IMPRESSED!! We ordered mozzarella sticks and a large pan pizza, simple enough, or so we thought. After 30 minutes, we asked the server where our sticks were. She clearly had forgotten all about them as she rushed away and had the cooks drop them. 40 minutes after the order was taken, we finally had 7 crappy little sticks of undercooked cheese. Our pizza took an hour and a half, while other patrons who were seated a half hour after us were done and leaving by time ours came up. The server we had clearly didn't know what the hell she was doing, even though she claimed she had been serving there for 14 years, yikes! She couldn't remember simple drink orders! My brother was waiting for his beer for 15 minutes before we had to remind her about it. She said ""oh you ordered another beer through me?"". We said, ""yes, duuuh!"" Thats when she explained to us she had been serving for 14 years and yada yada yada. She even told me that I wasn't smiling enough, WTF. I'm a paying customer, I don't have to smile especially if the service sucks. She got so flustered that she refused to serve us and we WERE NOT being mean and nasty, just unhappy. Super unprofessional on her part. On my way out we spoke with a manager briefly. The waitress then walked by and I muttered ""14 years of sucking ass"". I admit that was rude and immature, but then she fired right back with ""GO SUCK A DICK!"". WOW! At that point I just walked out and said that will be the one and only time I ever spend money there. I can't believe she said that, and in front of other customers. And finally, the pizza was mediocre at best which gives them their measly 1 star. Definitely nowhere near Lou Malnati's and Gioradano's quality. It makes sense they only have 1 location with all the rift raft that works there. Luckily, for that terrible waitress my brother is a better/nicer man than I and left her a 5 spot. If I had it my way it woulda definitely been a big fat STIFF!! Trust me go elsewhere, don't listen to your drunk friends. I will make sure to let everyone and anyone know just how bad this place sucks. Oh and this is my first and only time I've ever made a yelp review... It was that bad!"
"THE MOST OVERRATED PIZZA IN CHICAGO! Wow, I really wanted to like this pizza after all the hype but it was a great disappointment. I am a lover of ALL pizza but especially deep dish. I just don't get the praise especially for the burnt cheese crust - it just tasted bad. Pequods wouldn't even make my top 50 list seriously. Other pizzas nearby are sooooo much better like Art of Pizza. and nearly all others. I do understand how tough the restaurant business can be. Maybe they had an off night? I am very hesitant but maybe some day I will give it one more try, but then again, maybe not."
"In a city known for pizza, this is one not worthy of the hype. First time writing a review on Yelp, I tend to be more direct with my critique. I came for lunch and experienced horrible service. There were three servers eating their lunch as I waited to place MY ORDER and the waitress failed to put my order in which I was notified 30 min after placing it. I took it upon myself to notify the manager who said the waitress did not tell him probably because she screwed up on another customer's credit card...wtf!!! It seemed like complaints of bad service was routine for him. Also, the cheap lunch is the only thing special about this place...Gino's East is much better!!!!"
"Great food if your eating in. If you are getting delivery don't waste your time they are morons. I ordered a pizza they said it would be an hr and a half. 2 hours later I called and they claimed the driver was there and no one answered when he called (We told them our buzzer didn't work and make sure he calls). I sat on my couch waiting and the phone never rand and no message was left. I called and they told me they could send it again but it would be another 30 minutes (I live .5 mile up the same street). Funny, when they called back the phone rang fine. They didn't even over to comp the 15 dollar pizza. Thanks but Ill do giordannos next time"
"Hello,This is easily the worst deep dish in Chicago.  Sure the crust is carmelized, but the crust has no taste and its cheap.  About as generic as their website.  Save your money and make your own pizza bc it truly tastes like someone did not know what they were doing here.  Its truly that bad.  These other reviews are crazy.  If this is what Chicago critics think then I best move back to the suburbs.  If this place can stay in business, everyone should open up a pizza parlor.  Sorry Piqouds, your pizza is the pits!Chicago Pizza Critic,Andrew"
"Pizza burnt, not caramelized, took over an hour to get a small deep dish which was black on the bottom and had barely any sauce on it.  Pretty terrible service considering beers cost $6, waitress was awful."
Worst time estimate ever.  Quoted 50 min for a medium pizza. Was mmire than double the wait. Stood waiting for 50 min extra. Could have cooked 2 other pizzas while I was standing there. I kept being told it would be only 4 min wait. Dont trust their estimates.  Not worth the waste of my time.
Service is horrible. Been here for 2 and a half hours and still no pizza. Wait staff and management is of no help. People all around us have gotten their food ahead of us. Manager with ponytail is an asshole. No matter how good the pizza it is not worth this.
"I was really excited to bring my boyfriend here for his first time after me giving him such great reviews on this place. I told him how nice the staff were how great the environment is and best how tasty the food is. Our visit started out well until we were seated, in the middle of the room when there were clearly better seats available.  10 minutes had gone past, and not one person acknowledged us, offered water or even smiled. Finally our sever came,  asked us what we wanted to eat then was about to walk off without asking if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers( which of course we'd like something to drink). The non attentive service continued until I started saying something outloud about how terrible the service was and how disappointed I was. Every other table recieved drinks and food in an orderly amount of time. After we finally got our pizza 30-45 minutes later again I had to ask for a beverage refill and water. I worked in food service for 5 years, and still work in customer service and I was extremely disappointed in the service here. I've gotten nothing but great reviews and have eaten there with friends before but never recieved such disappointing service. I don't want anything in return, I didn't ask for money off our bill, but I will no longer be returning and giving my business here again. I'm sure a high volume place like pequods can afford to lose a customer here and there, but I will definitely be sharing my review among friends and Co workers. Sorry you lost a customer"
"This is only a review of the service because we didnt get to eat. Went there roday and it smelled amazing. Sat down and the waitress came over and we ordered our drinks and a salad. Salad and our waters came out quick and we ordered our pizza then... Nothing. Server didnt come back for over 30 mins. Came back finally and said 'i got caught up and forgot to take your order' no, idiot.... You took it 30 mins ago. Walks away again after she finds on her pad where she wrote it down then walked away to see if she put it in the computer. Then she didnt come back again and had another server come over to tell us she didnt put it in the computer! I undestand people make mistakes but not coming to check on your table for over 30 mins and then not owning up to your mistake is pretty crappy. We had been there over an hour now and they offered to rush our pizza... No thanks. The manager was super nice as was the other server tht got our problem dumped on her. They ended up comping our salad and water for over an hour of our time."
"Pequod's pizza was quite possibly the biggest let down of a recent trip to Chicago. My host loves LOVES their pizza, and quite frankly, I've had better from a roach truck in downtown Los Angeles.They don't skimp on the toppings, that's one thing that is a positive I guess. But there is too much (bottom) crust, too much sauce, barely enough cheese, and not nearly enough flavor.We got a simple pepperoni pizza and I couldn't even taste the cheese. The crust was SO dry and bland that it almost brought me to tears. I love pizza, we're really good friends and after this experience (we got delivery) I was let down so incredibly much.If you're looking for a delicious Chicago style pizza, you're better off checking out SUPERIOR Chicago style pizza at PIZZERIA DUE. They actually put cheese on their pizza and along with a wine-sauce, it tastes AMAZING.Brutal honesty coming... I felt like pure SHIT after 2 slices of this pizza, I thought hey, maybe it gets better if you have more. WRONG. I'll keep my more personal notes to myself, but really, you won't want to eat this pizza because it was have some down right terrifying effects on your insides."
"SO NOT WORTH THE WAIT. We waited for an hour and 15 minutes just to be seated and I don't know how long for the the pizza.  The do cook the pizza made to order, so I understand the food wait, but tacked on to the wait for a table and the canned sardine like atmosphere- the experience turned out to be not so good.They restaurant is super tiny and super crowded. I will say that I had an excellent salad!!! The lettuce was fresh and all of the leaves were perfect.  Given that I am not a fan of deep dish pizza, the rest of my meal was blah. I found the dough to be under cooked and there was way too much sauce. If I were being forced to eat deep dish pizza, Pequod's would not be my choice."
"Yuk.Slimy, over sauced, over-cheesed. I may not know much about pan pizza, but if this is what it's all about, I'll stick to Napoli."
"The reason I am giving one star is because the crust was burnt cheese but good and our server was nice but the pizza itself was uncooked doughy and disgusting. I did not like the tomato sauce on it at all. Honestly, this was my first deep dish pizza I was hesitant to try other pizza  places but i'm glad I did because my favorite was Pizano's and Lou Manati's."
"I'm pretty easy to please with pizza but I wasn't impressed with Peaquod's.  It was edible.  To be fair we ordered the thin crust (which seemed more like a regular crust).  I see most people rave about their deep dish. The crust was very bland but the tomato pizza sauce had a distinct flavor.  The cheese kept sliding off the crust every time we took a bite or served it.  Eating this was too much work. I can't get past the bland, dense crust so I highly doubt ill try their deep dish."
Don't order the salad.   The lettuce was not very fresh as it had a lot of brown spots and it showed its age.  Lettuce doesn't cost much and the markup on a salad is very high so to have them serve old lettuce speaks volumes.
If you like lots of crust and bread this pizza is for you. I unfortunately love a cheesy pizza that is not 90 percent crust and only 10 percent toppings. I'm bummed out because I have heard great things about their deep dish. Thin crust was ok if I remember correctly but it was several months ago.
"This is probably the worst pizza I've had in Chicago-- though I've had much worse in recent memory during a day's jaunt over to Indiana that made me shudder to think about living outside a city every again. Although, perhaps I'm being harsh on Pequod's, because the problem here was one of unmet expectations. We ordered a thin crust pizza, and the waitress followed up with ""Do you want any cheesy garlic breadsticks?"". Caught off guard, we said ""Sure, ok,"" expecting something along the lines of a small breadbasket. We were instead served two long planks of garlic bread, bubbling with cheese, and marinara sauce. And everything was excellent-- good quality cheese, and the sauce! Perfection! So, naturally, we were excited to see what our actual pizza would be like......and this is where Pequod's really faltered. The pizza appeared to have nothing in common with our fantastic appetizer-- poorer quality dough, cheese, and appallingly bad sauce. Also, we ordered our pizza with bell peppers, which had been over-cooked-- that's become a pet peeve since that fated Indiana pizza *shudders*, and it could have been worse, but I really prefer them crisp. Again, it wasn't terrible, it just suffered from a lack of melding of the flavors, as though the sauce wasn't in tune with the cheese, which wasn't in tune with anything else. Considering they seem to know what they're doing in the ""bread + cheese + sauce"" department, as evidenced by our appetizer, it must be just sheer perversity that leads them to make such poor quality pizza. We will not be back, cheesy garlic bread notwithstanding."
"Honestly I really wanted to like this place based on all of the great reviews from friends/family/yelp etc. Unfortunately our experience was less than stellar.We were seated upstairs on a busy but not overwhelming Saturday night which was a good atmosphere. Exposed brick, subdued lighting, cool feel. Both my husband and I had already ordered drinks from the bar and perused the menu so our order was very quick.The service was not. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer of cheesey garlic bread to come out, I've made cheesy garlic bread on my pizzaz at home quicker.5 minutes later our pizza came out, burnt on the edges might I add. I will say that the parts of the pizza that weren't scorched were good. Not out of this world, but decent. This where our previous server disappeared. We were given the check almost immediately after receiving our food, even though my beer was full and husbands was empty. We have both worked in the restaurant/bar industry for several years. You ALWAYS offer another drink when someone's glass is empty. No apology was ever given for our long wait. In fact we never saw our original server again.All in all, would not recommend or go back"
"I went here for lunch and it was just ok for me.  Lou Malnati's is my favorite pizza but I decided to give Pequod's a try after reading the reviews.  The lunch special is a great deal but I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  First of all, the drinks we had tasted weird.  I don't know if it was the ice, the cups, or the fountain gun, but something just made the coke taste kinda dirty.  The pizza was good but not great.  It really is more like Pizza Hut pan pizza than Chicago style pizza.  So if you prefer a more pan style with a lot of bread then you'd probably enjoy this."
"I am clearly in the minority, but I don't think Pequods is that good. To pick up 2 pizzas we left one hour and still had to wait 20 min once we got there. Was it worth it, no. The biggest complaint was too much bread to the crust. The deep dish has a good inch of bread under it, and one slice is incredibly filling because of it. The price is high, too!"
"Wow, really people? I ordered this pizza based on great reviews on Yelp. Where are you people coming from? This is the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life! The deep dish pizza has 1 inch of dough with a little bit of sauce and meat on top. The sauce was like tomato paste out of a can! No cheese to speak of except for the burnt cheese on the edge of the crust. Horrible! Got it delivered and it took more than 11/2 hrs. They said 1 hour. No thank you! Lou Malnatti's is still the best!"
Review for the thin crust. If you consider hand toss pizza thin crust then you should be good. I love crispy cracker thin ... this was not it. I had a bite of the deep dish and it was ok ... not a huge deep dish fan ... just so much bread.
"It is hard to remember being so disappointed. Eating pizza at all the awesome places in this city we had always said, ""And soon we'll eat Pequod's and it will be life changing good!"". It's always on top lists and I just saw it today on Eater's 38 essential  Chicago restaurants. I ordered a large deep dish to surprise my husband with two weeks ago and we were both so excited. No flavor. Seriously, no flavor. I had to put salt and pepper all over this thing just to taste something. I can't remember that much cheese ever being so unsatisfying before. And the mushrooms were just like water. When is one slice all that I want?? It was such a waste. The crust was good and I can see why people like that but I just feel like I was robbed because I ate bad pizza in Chicago. I could have gone anywhere else, even  Pizza Hut and enjoyed my pizza more because this was that bad. Give me thin crust at Spacca Napoli or deep dish at Exchequer any day over this."
"I never give reviews, but for this place, I had to make an exception. My husband brought me here 3 years ago, and I'm sorry to say, that after giving it a second chance - I was as disappointed today, as I was then. Seriously bad pizza. I have absolutely no idea why the good reviews. The pan pizza (we had both times) is all bread and very, very little cheese...and waaaaaay too much mediocre sauce. Good ambiance, but that's no reason to go anywhere to eat. Bad, bad, bad. Bad, bad."
"Dear Pequod's - You have just lost our business forever! ~ Also I will be posting this review on Facebook so all of my friends can read about your terrible business practice as well..We have just moved to a new apartment in the city last month and we called what ""used to be"" our favorite pizza place to see if they deliver to our new neighborhood. YES! They do, they tell us! ""Awesome!!"" - Send over a pizza we say! Great, they say. It'll take about and hour and a half they say. ""Sounds good"" we say...........We wait......We wait........We wait........ We wait.......Pizza never shows up...............We call them about two hours later.  They tell us they gave our pizza away! Uhhh, Whut? YES THEY GAVE OUR PIZZA AWAY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY DO NOT DELIVER TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!!!!  I guess this goes without saying but they could have told us that at the time the order was placed instead of just blowing us off and GIVING our pizza away!!! Turns out or house is two blocks from their delivery border. I guess they could have also called us after the fact to let us know.  Nope - Nothing of the sort happened. I have completely lost faith in this business. When we called them to find out what was up with our order, they we're even rude to us over the phone!  How is this even acceptable in this era of Yelp, Facebook, Etc????? Do NOT give this place your business! P.S. I literally wrote this review with a tear running down my cheek. Iused to love this place. Sadly is has fallen by the wayside. I had seen this coming. Management and staff seem to be perpetually stoned/drunk and they no longer give a shit about customers.  So sad......Best of luck to you Pequod's..Buhbye!"
Not great. Not awful. Accurately priced. Alrighty.
"My husband, tireless in his quest to taste every highly rated pizza in Chicago, ordered carry out from this place because of its history and all the hype.  Can't comment on the fun atmosphere because of the carryout, but must say the pizzas (sausage, onion, mushroom and spinach) were a huge disappointment.   Too much dry, bready crust, and way too little topping.  I couldn't even taste the spinach on mine and the stingy amount of cheese was undetectable against the thick crust.  The sausage was OK and the tomato sauce tasty, but again, way too little to balance the crust."
"Having recently moved to Chicago, I was feeling the need to take a break from the chaos of combining two households into one. Not wanting to cook or go out, we decided to order some comfort food. For me, this was nothing fancy - just a plain cheese pizza, well-done.When I opened the box, I saw a round pizza cut into squares, covered in a thick, impenetrable layer of grease. While I can't take points off for the cutting nonsense (save it for the Sicilian pies), I definitely can justify the low rating by saying it was the single most unappetizing pizza I have ever seen. Honestly, did someone pour french fry grease ONTO the pizza? It was nauseating. Because we had no food, after pulling off the cheese and using about a half a roll of paper towels to soak up the remaining grease, I did eat a couple of the squares. It was mediocre.Perhaps it's something I need to get used to, but I like round pizza to come in slices, not squares. I like my pizza to be edible, not soggy and wet. I like my pizza to have a delicious crust, not blackened.Maybe they were having an off night, maybe it was somebody new...but how can a pizza joint not know how to make a plain cheese? As a teenager I worked in a pizza place and during our down time we used to concoct some pretty wild creations, but this slimy pie beats our worst idea by a mile. Come on."
"What happened to you Pequods????  We moved back to Chicago in March of 07 and started our quest for the best pizza in the city.  We mostly lived in the burbs before really.  Our friend took us to Pequods and said to be prepared to be amazed - and we were!  Love the tasty pan pizza with the burnt cheese!!!!  We told people many times that it was a contender for our favorite in the city.  Dined in another 1-2 times in 07-08.But then we ordered delivery in 2009... wow, is this the same pizza?  There is SO MUCH DOUGH and it is dry. The sauce is still tasty, but very thin, and the burnt cheese still rules. But I could hardly eat it because of the dough.  I don't want to have to pick my toppings off a pizza, that is not a good pizza.So, we thought maybe since it was delivery it just wasn't the same or just a fluke one time. I had a girls movie night last night and they all wanted to order Pequods.  We got 2 pan and 1 thin (since I hadn't tried thin yet).  Me and another friend ended up eating only the top half of our pan pieces and the crust - again - way to much dry dough!  It just isn't cutting it. Maybe they changed the recipe?  The thin was good, but not really thin - I would say it was ""normal"" thickness, and maybe more of what the pan pizza should be, just add the burnt crust to the thin pizza and it would be better I think.Well, that all being said, Pequods went from one of our favorites, to one that we won't be ordering again.  Sad.  I'll miss that big whale with undies on his head!"
As much as I like the pizza I will not order it again due to the consistently bad service.  Last time I called to order delivery they told me it would be a long wait.  Before I could tell them I would just come pick it up the receptionist hung up on me.  Too many other good options in Chicago to put up with the poor service.
"I have to say this place was a total disappointment.   We called ahead at about 5 on a Saturday night to see what the wait was.  They told me 45 minutes but that they would put my name down so we were already in line.  When we got there, 20 minutes later, I was told it would be another 45 minutes.   Stupidly, we agreed to wait the extra 20 minutes.   When we were finally seated, our server told us the wait would be an hour for pizza.   So we put our order in immediately since now they kind of had us stuck at 630  on a Saturday night.  After waiting an hour and a half, my party agreed we would just leave.  Since we hadn't seen our server in half an hour, we walked down to the hostess station.  They managed to catch my dad and tried to charge him for a pizza we didn't  even get.  I spoke with the manager after this since they were essentially trying to trick my dad into paying for something we didn't even receive.  After speaking with him and explaining our disappointing evening, he tried to make it right.   He told us he would get us a pizza right away.  I asked why it took us trying to leave to get our pizza.  He tried to make it right by comping our appetizer and  drinks and sent us home with a pizza.  That is the only reason I gave 2 stars.  The pizza was not very good and the service was awful.   The manager tried to make it up to us, but that was after our evening was already ruined.  Would never go back."
"The service was perfectly nice and the place is clean and well-maintained.  But I give it one star because the pizza is absolutely terrible.  It's like Domino's level: nasty spongy crust groaning under spaghetti sauce and rubber ""cheese.""  Gross."
"I'd give this place many more stars, but I only enjoy their food when I can get it.  I just can't grasp why the ""delivery area"" changes.  I have ordered from them before and they have delivered, when I call they ask if this is my name and my address because I have ordered from them before.  I called Sunday night, spoke with whomever picked up the phone (putting me on hold without putting me on hold).  So now I can hear everyone talking in the back, and people saying I don't see why we wouldn't deliver there.  Now a manager gets on the phone and tells me, sorry we can't deliver to you.  Why? I've been delivered to before.  Because we have to keep our customers happy....??? Wait what? I am calling just to talk and see how your Sunday night is going?  Nope... I am calling for PIZZA!!! So when I said I wouldn't ever order from them again, guess what?  The woman manager said OK.  Guess you guys must pride yourself on customer service.... Thanks for the past pizza pies Pequods, but I am in the service industry myself and everyone I talk to about pizza will never go in and patronize your place again."
"Don't understand what the hype is all about here. Came here on Valentine's Day and the staff was very rude especially the waiter who eyeballed me up and down and she sat us down at a dirty nasty booth with some crusty brown stuff on my seat next to me. Seems like someone was a little grumpy that they didn't have a Valentine's . Stupid ass waiter went to refill my boyfriend's coke and didn't arrive till 7 minutes later and left it on an empty table diagonal from ours and walked away (wtf lol?). I was so fed up that I was just going to walk over there and grab it from the table. We ordered a deep dish pizza and it took more than an hour to arrive. Come on now, there's barely anybody here, it does not take THAT long to push out a pizza. Then the dumbass waiter didn't know how to cut my pizza and gave me the most tiny sliver of a pizza, said ""woops"" and walked away. Pizza wasn't even that good, I'm sure that there's a much better pizza place than this dirty dump. Overall, it was a bad experience and will never be ordering from them again. Oh and they gave everyone who ate there a rose while they were leaving, but they didn't give us one. Talk about customer service."
"Placed an order for delivery at 5pm was told the order would be delivered within 90 minutes.  Then within 90 minutes the delivery driver called he was at another address and seem inconvenienced when I provided the correct address.  I Called in was placed on hold fo 15 to 20 and basically was told by a Manager ""what would you like me to do"". IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME TO CALL AND SPEAK TO A MANAGER. After 10 minutes I received another call asking how I would like my order handled.  I was hoping that delivering immediately since it was their mistake would be the course of action.  My food arrived at 745.  I ordered at 5pm to ensure my out of town visitors would be able to eat prior to enjoying a show.  Thankfully I made a salad myself so they only ate that for dinner and now i have a large gross soggy disgusting pizza and stayed behind to wait for the delivery since i was unable to get through and just cancel the order.  NEVER ORDER FROM HERE.  I NEVER WILL. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I don't blame the driver but a Manager should be able resolve the problems and coordinate logistics to ensure proper service.  You lost a customer and since we typically dine in I will now ensure to recommend any other place for dine in or delivery.  THANK YOU TO THE DRIVER WHO WAS POLITE AND APOLOGETIC. I MADE SURE TO TIP HIM AFTER PAYING FULL PRICE FOR THE WORST DELIVERY EXPERIENCE SINCE IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT AND  THE MANAGER DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ME OR MY ORDER I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ANYWHERE ELSE."
"I was excited for my first visit to Pequods, having heard only good things.  We arrived at 640 for our 645 reservation and were told ""20 minutes"". One hour and 27 minutes later we were seated. No apology, no free soda while waiting. Nothing. Does it matter if the pizza is good if the service is terrible and they don't care about their customers?"
"ZERO STARS   After sitting for 15 minutes for a cup of water, with an ice cube.  And then waiting another 15 minutes and the waitress never came back to take our order- we walked out.  Pathetic service!!!   No one had food upstairs except the big room with the party.  I am glad all your wait staff felt like they were the only customers and no one else needed to eat.   Would never go back"
"the food is great, but whoever the girl is that takes orders over the phone needs to find a personality... I have been in the service industry for many years and she is by far the rudest person I have ever placed a food order with. find a new person to answer the phone.."
"Pequod's Pizza on Sunday evening, 4/7/13.We tried the mozzarella sticks and a pan (deep dish) pizza with sausage, mushroom, and black olives.  The mozzarella sticks were okay and basic.The pizza was a big disappointment.  On the plus side, the charred bits of crust had good flavor, as did the large pieces of sausage.  On the minus side:  the sauce was very watery and had almost no flavor (similar to Prego or Ragu), the crust did not taste good and quickly became soggy and bread-like.   Maybe their pizza is usually better, but there is no way we'll return to find out.We were asked several times how we were doing and if we wanted drink refills, but the service was mechanical and hurried.  The place was crowded and noisy, with a sports-bar atmosphere.  Not the place to go if you want to have a conversation."
"I would disagree with most here. There deep dish is so doughy its unreal and lacks flavor. Maybe the thin is much better.  lou's, unos, ginos, art of pizza are much better choices for true chi pie. Pequods pizza is the pits!!!!"
Ordered a thin crust pizza for delivery and got a pan pizza. Called back to tell them about mistake and the airhead girl taking orders couldn't find order. Pan pizza sucks and will never order from this messed up joint again.
I think I built this up in my mind a little too much beforehand. I'm a pizza fanatic and I'm always trying to find the best pizza of my life. I was told to try Pequod's ASAP. We picked it up and took it home one snowy night. We didn't get meat on it which I think may have been part of the problem. We got the deep-dish style with mushrooms. The crust was AMAZING I'm not going to lie about that. It is burnt a little bit with a glaze they put on which is really delicious. It was the main pizza part that I was kinda disappointed with. I didn't think there was enough cheese or sauce - it was mostly breading. Call me crazy - but I'm just not crazy about Pequod's!
"Not sure what the big deal is here?? I'll sum up my experience..1.) Took 2 hours on a sat night for our pizza,2 hours for our salads and 2 hours and 30 minutes for our over cooked and tiny bowel of pasta--2.) I'm not a fan o their thin crust ( their deep dish is good and the only reason why I'm giving them 2 stars!) They pretty much just slap a ton of meat on it and ignore putting quality cheese on the pie..3.) Service is BAD and they know it!!! Took 2 hours for our salads to even come out and the owner was sitting around socializing, our waitress was mia and flirting with the bar tender-- the people next to us walked out! Said I would have walked out myself but I know our 3 year old would have been heart broken! We got our pizza-- ate  quickly and as possible and when we were ready for our check they brought out my over cooked pasta dish!!! Asked the waitress to please take it off because it looked disgusting.. She gave me this look and said she would have to talk with someone else and that if I waited another 35 minutes they could make us a new bowl-- you've got to be kidding-- I insisted that she take it off our bill... not worth your time!!! It's packed to the gills with loud/ drunk depaul students, not a good place for families!"
"I'm fine being the only person that did not enjoy the pizza here AT ALL. Yes the burnt cheese on the crust is good but I can do that at home.  The rest of the crust is TOO thick, too much bread. Not enough cheese. They give a decent amount of toppings but they'd have to give me a mountain of meat and cheese to make that much bread tasty. I know I hate it when I stop eating after 1 slice. I NEVER STOP EATING AFTER ONE SLICE!Also our server was kind of an idiot. When I said ""can we get a round of water for everyone"", that doesn't mean 4 glasses of water for 7 people. Simple math girl. Simple math."
"I don't get their pizzas. I was so excited to read ""caramelized crust"", but by caramelized they really mean burnt. The edges are burnt and the crust is.. well, it's just bread. I don't think they use yeast.. more like baking soda or baking powder as a riser, and so it tastes more like very thick breadsticks than what you'd expect as pizza dough that Italian chefs spin in the air. Not enough cheese. Sauce was too salty. I would never rate this as one of Chicago's bestest pizzas as others have put it. I've had better."
"This was a very disappointing experience, because heard good things about Pequod's. Unfortunately, that wasn't our experience. It took us an hour to get a SMALL THIN crust pizza and when we got it, it was burned! We'd have sent it back, but we didn't have another hour to wait... See the picture attached for the burn evidence..."
"Nothing special. Lincoln Park people seem to love it for some reason...  Much better pizza elsewhere.... This might seem like great pizza to all the out of state people that flock to chicago, but as an Illinois native it is bland and pitiful. I wouldn't spend my money here again. Group of 10 ordered 4 pizzas, 4 appetizers and a round of drinks total was $500..."
"I've heard over & over that this is a Sox bar. Not sure why to the point that I'm wondering if that term, ""Sox bar"" is a pejorative.The beer was cold enough but the food was just OK and oddly expensive, as if I didn't know any better. Sorry, I wasn't drunk enough not to notice I was being ripped off. It's bad enough my White Sox are pretending to be the Cubs this year (aka ""sucking"") at least break off a deal or help me drowned my sorrows without going broke."
"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 9 friends. Got seated right away upstairs. It took for-e-ver for the pizza to arrive and when it did I was definitely not impressed. We were not informed of the length of the wait and tables that ordered after us got their food first. To top it all off, we ordered a cheese pizza that arrived stone cold. The worst part was watching the waitress behind the bar take a huge paddle brush out of her purse and run it through her hair several times and pull her hair into a ponytail many times. And, she kept smoothing her hair back with both hands. Then, she served drinks and food without washing her hands. Eww. Never again."
I went here based on yelp reviews. This is the worst pizza I have ever had. It was so bad I declined to take home the 2/3rd left over pizza. I would have preferred a frozen pizza. I had great expectations and left hungry and disappointed. The deep dish is all crust and very little cheese and toppings. I live a couple of blocks away from this place and was hoping for a good pizza joint walking distance from my house. If it was even close to okay I would be a regular. Maybe the thin crust is better. I should have listened to a friend of mine who always told me its not all that good. Just to be fair I won't mention the pizza places I like. Most of the time I would give a place another try. In this case I will pass.
"I rarely give 1 star - maybe I am a little bitter because I was expecting so much from everyone's review of this place. Ok maybe it should be more like a 2 if they actually cooked our pizza thoroughly. We ordered a large deep dish with sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms. it came out with the famous caramelized crust, the bread dough was rawish  in the center, and bellpeppers and mushroom topping was not cooked and the pizza sauce was cold!We took most of it home, my poor husband got diarrhea later that night, so we just ended up tossing this out entirely."
Haven't had a chance to try the pizza yet. This is purely based on the service so far. We had a reservation for 7:30 and were told it would be 20-30 mins. It's been 50 and still no seat. Can say ill come here again even if the pizza is wonderful.
"My friend and I went here for pizza this past Sunday. We ordered a large deep dish with sausage and it was super delicious. The only thing about this place was that the hostess was horrible! She was super rude. We walked in and she asked us how many seats we needed. I told her ""two"", she grabbed a couple menus asked us to follow her, literally threw them on the table and then walked away. I would have told her off but I didn't want to risk our pizza being spit on. Anyway, watch out for her. She's a tall average looking Caucasian girl with dark blond her. If it wasn't for her I would have given this place 4 stars."
Not as good as I expected it to be. I've heard people rave about this place but I believe it was too pricey for the quality I ordered pepperoni and sausage thin crust and it was just okay.
"I really want to like this place given the high reviews but after a few attempts I always regret ordering it after the first bite.  Not sure what the rave is about.  The pan pizza is 2 inches of bread and sooooo bland.  I even ordered with extra sauce hoping for more flavor.  It's more like bread and sauce, not pizza.  Not worth $30.  I could get a loaf of bread at Jewel for $3 and slab on some sauce.  Skip this place..."
"We decided to dine on ""the best deep dish"" in Chicago, but man, this was disappointing as heck!  Perhaps it was good once upon a time, but no longer.  We ordered a 12"" for 2 people, topped with sausage, pepperoni, peppers and onions (of course, cheese and tomato sauce below that).  The pizza showed up about 30min later, looked nice around the edges but the first bite was cold, raw dough and the toppings weren't much better (cold/raw).  The waitress saw that we weren't eating it quickly so she asked if all was ok, when we said 'not really' she picked up the spatula and started to stab at the pizza from all angles, which disassembled the layers. She summoned the manager who immediately admitted that the pizza was below par and ""undercooked by about 2 minutes"" (10% of the cooking time, he later clarified). He offered to ""throw a few slices back into the oven"" but agreed it would not be the same even cook that a pizza should have - if you run a pizza joint yet can't make a pizza properly, ain't that a problem? The venue itself was nothing special, which we actually liked, but the guys who bring the pizza to your table are also busy taking bags of trash and big dirty trash cans around the restaurant and there is NOT a lot of hand washing going on.  In the end, we paid for the pizza but only ate a few nibbles around the edges.  Overall, can't say that Pequod's takes pride in its craft: aside from the front from staff, the toppings were rather chaotically tossed all over the ill-cooked pizza and it was clearly made in haste by people that consider making pizza just a job.  Without a little passion coming from the kitchen, might as well eat Pizza Hut."
World's slowest service. Wait staff ignores you once you request an update on your food an hour after ordering.  I hope this pizza is the best tasting thing on the planet......
"This was my first time to Pequod's, and I left disappointed.  The three of us ordered a large Caesar salad to share.  It was small, bland, and only had two cherry tomatoes.  Does the small salad only come with one tomato?  Sure this is pretty minor, but it just seemed weird to me.  Basically, it tasted like a Caesar salad out of a bag at the grocery store.  Oh well, we were there for the pizza anyway...  We ordered a medium pan pizza with basil and giardiniera.  I was pretty excited to try the pizza because i love that almost burnt crust/cheese taste.  However, the crust itself was just ok.  It tasted like normal bread with some crunchy bits around the edges.  I had expected something more with how people rave about it.  And the lack of toppings was sad.  There was a sprinkling of giardiniera and basil.  But, what really annoyed me was the lack of cheese.  It was sprinkled on with a lot of the pizza covered with only sauce.  So, I felt like we got a huge piece of bread with sauce and a tiny bit of cheese and toppings.  Not worth it at all."
Not crazy about their deep dish pizza. Would like a little more sauce and a little less dough. Almost tastes like pizza hut to me. yuck
"Tiny spot crammed with patrons.  They take reservations but will not let you order pizza ahead... no way!... and make you wait one hour at your table for your pizza.  We ordered a deep dish which was more like bit of dark sauce, covered by a dash of cheese over a thick, floury, dense, taste-like-nothing dough...  Their thin crust may be better, if they put more cheese on it... will not be going back.  Loud environment.  The waiters and the owner were very friendly but the pizza--- we did not like."
"This review is tough to write because, from a taste standpoint, Pequod's HAD been a pizza that I'd enjoyed twice in past experiences after trying it for the first time a year or so ago. After my most recent experience, however, I will not be returning as a customer - unless there happens to be a change in management.On a Saturday evening (4:45pm), I phoned in an order of two pizzas (one thin crust and one deep dish) for our family. I was informed my wait would be approximately 50-60 minutes. I showed up at the restaurant at 5:40pm after 55 minutes and was informed that my pizzas still needed about 10-15 minutes. On a busy Saturday night, I thought this was reasonable and appreciated them letting me know (vs. just saying it would be ""a couple more minutes"").After 20 additional minutes had passed, I asked about the status of my order and was told the takeout server would be back shortly. When she returned, I was told that they just put one of my pizzas IN the oven - 80 minutes after I placed the order. After waiting another 10 minutes, the manager came out with both pizzas. Upon expressing my frustration for their clear delay in placing part of the order, and the fact that the first pizza of mine had been sitting there for 20+ minutes, he offered me $15 off a future order, and said my delay was ""typical"" for them. Given the experience to that point, I should have checked the pizzas on the spot, but upon returning home and opening the box, the pan pizza that had been sitting for 30+ minutes (by that time) had completely collapsed in the box, leaving a smeared mess of toppings and sauce and a thoroughly soggy box. The thin crust pizza that had been forgotten was burned considerably on the crust (past the normal ""carmelization"" of Pequod's crusts). I really was looking for a simple mea culpa from the manager. Everyone makes mistakes; but he continually expressed that my experience (even the pizza waiting on top of the oven for 20+ minutes) was typical for them and offered no recourse on my current order. If this is the ""typical"" Pequod's experience, count me out. I can think of 4-5 other spots (Art of Pizza, Lou Malnati's, Jet's, Bricks) on the north side of the city that serve a more consistent pizza and, most importantly, take accountability if they happen to make a mistake."
"Good Italian sausage, tasty crust, oh and yeah the carmelized edge. But 90 minutes from entering the front door (even with a ""reservation"") to getting a pie on the table? Give me a break no pizza is worth that kind of wait - especially with kids. Give me a pizza from Bert's Place anytime. Besides the extremely loud guy behind us, the noise level for a Friday night crowd on the 2nd floor rivaled being on the tarmac at O'Hare. Definitely not a family place."
"I really, really, really wanted to love this place.  I'd heard so many good things, and my friend and I used to drool at it while we worked out across the street at Bally's and she would tell me how amazing it was.  We often said we needed to make our way over there, and tonight we finally did.Service was...  how do I put this...  the very definition of lackadaisical.  (Yes, I've been dying to use that in a sentence.)  When I entered, a guy informed me all the booths were full and just kind of motioned towards the tables.  I took that as my cue to pick my own table.Table selected, we sat down and our server came over.  We ordered drinks, and she didn't seem to want to take our food order.  I can't figure that out.  I started with the house salad, which was very... wet.  I felt like I needed a paper towel to take some of the water off the lettuce.  The salad was just okay, nothing earth shattering.  My friend got the minestrone soup, and I didn't think to ask her how it was but she gobbled it up so I would assume it was good.We ordered a thin crust pizza....  yet when they brought it out it was pan.  We said we ordered thin.  The server said we ordered pan.  I assured her we did not, as pan was never even a consideration for us.  The server said it would be 10 minutes to get a new pizza.  Okay, fine.  But there were no apologies for screwing up our order, and I felt like we were putting her out.  You know, for *her* mistake.Finally the correct pizza came out, and it was piping hot.  I was so excited to dig in...  but it was just...  missing the mark completely.  The crust I had heard so much about was dry and didn't really have any flavor.  The sauce was eh.  The cheese was eh.  I mean, it's pizza, it's pretty hard to screw up, but it just fell way short of my expectations.Pizza consumed, we waited forever for our check.  Then we got to talking and might have forgotten about it.  But when we realized they were getting busy and we needed to give up our table, our server kept walking by and not picking up the check and the obvious credit card laid down on top of it.  I finally flagged her down, and we finally managed to leave.I hate to say it, but I won't be going out of my way to come back here.  But they were pretty busy tonight, so I'm thinking they won't miss my business..."
"Decided to give Pequod's another try and it was the same as I remembered. A long wait for bland (thin crust) pie.   Most everyone orders the deep dish which I am not a fan of.  Admittedly, I am a long time Chicagoan who no longer enjoys deep dish.   There are many wonderful other local options for both elsewhere:  Pat's, Art of Pizza and Lou's.  Please note this review is strictly based on the food however.  Giving 2 stars because our server was great and the staff seemed to run a well coordinated effort, given the size of the crowd.  Atmosphere is cozy upstairs.  One other item to note:  Be weary of going on a weekend.  Besides the very long wait, our table unfortunately was seated next to a loud group of over-served young adults who continued to get louder with each pitcher they drank.   They dominated the entire room to the point that our party was yelling at each other in order to be heard.  The management did speak with the group however that only fueled them more. Sigh.  Trust, better options elsewhere."
"Don't like it. At all. I can't believe how many people give this place good reviews. Where are you people from???? Not Chicago, that's for sure. This is NOT Chicago deep dish. It's a slushy mess of grossly sweet sauce on burnt crust. I've had it twice (because other people ordered it and I was famished) and disliked it both times. Yuck."
"Their deep dish is way overrated. The ""carmelized"" crust was burnt a crispy charcoal and the sauce was blander than canned tomatoes. Plus they put the mushrooms on top of the sauce. Maybe they were having a bad night but there are much better deep dish options."
"terrible pizzas...I ordered 2 for pick up, I was told 1 hr and 15 minutes...I showed up after 1 hour, the pizza were ready and must have been ready for over 30 minutes...the crust was stale as if it was warming way way to long.  The pizza here is basically thick bread with a thin thin layer of cheese smothered in sauce - the sauce is good but the cheese is completely missing.  I've had better domino's pizza and that is the absolute worst pizza there is."
"Friends, DO NOT GO ON A WEEKEND.  We waited a relatively short period for a table, about twenty minutes, which was suprising since the wait can be much longer.  Now don't get me wrong, we love the pizza here, but once the server came by and asked for our order, we were told the wait was going to be an HOUR AND A HALF for any pie and if you wanted deep dish it would be much longer.  When we asked why she said it was the volume of delivery and in-house orders.  So either get your fix on a week day or order delivery before you get hungry."
"Barely edible! After reading all of the positive reviews, I was so looking forward to trying Pequod's pizza. I ordered a medium, cheese, pan pizza for takeout. The box did not feel very hot, and I opened it to find lukewarm, soggy pizza. The cheese was not melted, and looked like layers of sliced mozzarella on top of thick bread with sauce on top.  Even the charred edge (caramelized crust??) of the pizza was cold. The only redeeming quality was the sauce, which made the pizza barely edible."
"Overpriced at night 7 in, deep dish cheese pizza. Nice thick piece of bread with tasty tomato sauce and just a hint of cheese."
"Not a fan of the the burnt crust.  Oh, I forgot... it's ""caramelized"".  When I accidently burn food, I just say it's ""Cajun-style""!We ordered a sausage pizza with extra tomatoes.  My guy swore that this was one of his favorite pizzas, but I am not impressed.  The pizza was soggy underneath the toppings, and that burnt crust is gross.  Never again."
"I just chime in to slam the thin crust here.  I don't like deep dish pizza, but apparently this is a great place for deep dish.  Still, a pizza place should do both well.  Really bad pizza.  A big messy layer of greasy white cheese that seemed to have had the taste sucked out of it.  I was perplexed.   What kind of cheese was this supposed to be?  Nihilist cheese.  I just made that up.   Cheese seems be suffering from ennui.   I really can't get beyond the nihilist cheese on the thin crust here.  No passion.  No spark.  Defeatist cheese.  Dead cheese.  Big gloppy greasy cheese that hangs around a small town convenience store on Friday nights, because there is nothing else to do.  Boring cheese.  The crust was decent though.  And the server was really nice.    Really bad thin crust.  Don't get it.  If you like deep dish, Pequod's will be fine.  Menu is generally limited as well."
"It appears that Pequod's is an acquired taste.  Either that or they made the worst pizza in their history the night we ordered a pizza to be delivered to our apartment.  I love pizza.  I mean I really, really love pizza.  Giordano's, Malnati's, GIno's, Ranalli's, Edwardo's - I love them all.  They are all different, but the differences make it fun to order pizza from different places.  We were very excited to try Pequod's because - clearly - most people really like their pizza.  I hate to be so negative, but I was absolutely shocked at how bad this pizza was.  One of the other reviewers rates this a notch above Pizza Hut - and I think that's about right.  Let's start with the crust.  It is unique, but it also completely overwhelms the pizza.  The pizza really is about 80% bread.  That would never be a good thing, but it definitely isn't a good thing at Pequod's.  Also, the pizza didn't have nearly enough cheese and the sauce was bland to the point of being nearly tasteless.  I had to dump a ton of red peppers on each slice of pizza to give the pizza any taste at all.  What made all of this worse is that we always order a large pizza so that we can enjoy the leftovers for a couple of days.  I find that most pizza is as good - if not better - the second day.  Not Pequod's.  This pizza dries out very rapidly (since it is mostly bread), and the lack of taste on the first day is amplified by the (now) lousy texture that you encounter on days two and three.  I have never thrown out leftover pizza; if my wife hadn't eaten the last two slices, then this would have been my first time.  It would help a bit if this pizza weren't so expensive, but a large with sausage, green peppers, and onion was about $28.  A similar pie from Ranalli's or Edwardo's is about five dollars cheaper (in part because it is very easy to get coupons for either of these restaurants).  We did order delivery - so maybe it would be better at the restaurant - but I am not going to go there to find out.  I only have four months left in Chicago, and I can't afford to waste another evening of pizza on Pequod's.  For what it is worth the delivery was VERY prompt - absolutely fantastic service."

I've had tombstone pizzas that tasted better than Pequod's thin crust. Not even a beer special.....
ok food n bar ambiance but terrible customer service especially saturday night.waited 1 1/2 hr 2 b seated (no reservation- thats ok) but d pizza was cold n burned.how can u do that at d same time?appetizer came late.waiters take forever 2 serve a glass of water n refill (should proactively offer it in d 1st place).parking is a problem.
"Never again! It's been 1hr 40m that I've waited, haven't even had my dinner and I'm writing this place off.Absolutely ridiculous service. I've been on hold three times now--the first time I called after an hour lapsed and they confirmed that a driver had already left. Fast forward 30m, still no pizza and they put me on hold twice, waiting a total of 10 min. and I just hung up out of frustration and generally feeling pissed off.I hope this pizza is worth the $0.00 I will be paying in total!!"
"Pizza was just good. Carmelized crust is not for me. I prefer to not cut the inside of my mouth on burnt crust that is also probably not good for you. Plus, it doesn't have much flavor. MOST importantly though: Service was horrible! With making reservations, we still had to wait 30 minutes in a crowded, horrible intersection to be seated. Then the hostess forgot she had given us a buzzer so we had to inquire after waiting 30 minutes. Usually deep dish takes 45 minutes to make; it took an hour fifteen minutes. We missed our movie. The waitress never apologized and the manager said 30 minutes to be sat (despite making a reservation) and over an hour to wait for your food (even though they tell you 45 minutes), is NORMAL at Pequods. So if you are going to see a movie or need to be anywhere allow yourself a good two and a half hours if you want to make it on time. Also the seating is very cramped. Something's gotta give. Even though the wait time and place and seating was horrible, the staff response was worse. No apologies from them. They were smug and cold. Never again. Lou Malnati's and Giordanos are sooo much better (better flavored crust) and the staff treats you like a person."
This place has gone downhill; I used to really enjoy the food here. The pizza was burned the last time I came here and it's just not very good anymore. The service is spotty. Sometimes it's good....sometimes not so good. Ambiance is okay if you like loud sports.The restroom always seems kinda dirty. I don't think I'll come back.
"Pizza is pretty good, however, their staff and service is downright horrible. Ordered delivery and not the whole order arrived and when asked when we can get it, the delivery driver started giving me attitude and talking back to me. Called in to get it corrected and the person taking orders started giving me attitude as well. Such a shame good food gets overshadowed by horrible service."
"I ordered a large deep dish and an order of garlic bread for delivery.  The pizza arrived in about 45 minutes but the garlic bread was missing.  The driver said it had been left at the restaurant and that he would go and get it right away - an hour later I call the restaurant to check on the garlic bread, and the phone clerk apologizes profusely and says it's on the way.  Two hours later I called again to check on it, and the same phone clerk apologizes again and then goes to check with a manager.  She comes back and launches into a lengthy explanation about how she and the dispatcher had done their jobs correctly and that the driver had messed up - I hadn't blamed anyone or been rude at all so it was very odd and unprofessional that I was being given a speech about who at the restaurant had screwed up my order.  I finally got the bread 4 hours after I originally placed my order.  The pizza and garlic bread were pretty average although both were a little burned, and the service was seriously lacking."
"Pequod's is simply undeserving of the 4-star average rating.I have eaten here maybe 10 times in 15 years.  Just recently I ordered a large sausage deep dish.  This thing took an hour and a half to be delivered two blocks north and 5 blocks east.  Once it arrived it was more expensive than I thought- they didn't give me a total, just an oversight, but had I known I would have ordered baccino's or amato's- anything.The pie arrives. We open the box.  Eyes open wide, mouths salivate, and we each take a slice.After one bite- Garbo.  Simply shitty pizza.  Now this is the deep dish that I'm talking about.  And this is Chicago mind you.  You can get away with this kind of schwag in Colorado, but not in the land of pizza and hot dogs. No No No.This thing is 95% bread.  Little Sauce and even less cheese.  The sausage itself was fine.The ""crust"", as people call it, is a gimick- silly chewy not chrunchy, greasy and it was an effin miracle I even made it that far.Verdict:  slow. pricey. gross.  and yes Doug S., two stars is being too nice."
"Terrible service- manager is rude.  We waited 2 hours for our pizza and then told the waitress we needed our pizza boxed b/c we were taking our friends to the train.  The waitress told us it will be ready in 5 min- 20 min later there was no pizza.  At this point we could not wait any longer and had to leave to drop our friends off at the train and told the manager we would call him.  Ten minutes later we called and the manager was very rude; 2.5 hours had passed and we were very hungry and said we were on our way back to pick the pizza up.  The manager then said he gave the pizza away and voided our credit card.  He did not offer any concessions for our time,  sympothy or apologize."
"I'm not a fan of the caramelized (burned and rubbery) cheese on the crust. The sauce was plentiful, without being too acidic and making me regret eating one piece too many.But, overall, the meal was forgettable. I think I'd try every other deep dish place in Chicago before looping back to this one."
"Caramelized crust was good, but the pizza overall was not. This is the exact reason I don't generally like deep-dish...Pequod's crust is more like a thick, heavy Bisquick creation rather than the chewy, flavorful yeast-based crusts I prefer. I can't exactly say if it's better or worse than any other deep-dish, but I didn't like it. And it took over 45 minutes to get my carryout pie.It's a shame...I've heard for 10 years how good this place was. The search continues."
"I was pretty excited about getting pizza from here and we ordered the thin crust, which was probably the mistake given everyone mentioned the pan-style but I don't really care for a lot of crust in my pizza. Unfortunately, the trust was soggy and and toppings didn't blow me away. Delivery was quick. The pizza was still warm but the garlic bread was cold and I had to re-heat it. I've simply had better pizza."
If I could give negative stars I would. Ordered a large sausage pepperoni pizza at 5pm. How hard is that. Got a large sausage spinach delivered at 6:30pm. Called back and was told would have to go to back of line and would be at least 2 hours for the right pizza. Oh by the way it's New Year's Eve and have plans that's why piZa was ordered at 5:00pm. Well 9:30pm 4 1/2 hours after the order was placed still no pizza in sight and it's time to go out. This will definitely be the last time I'll order from here. The first pizza the wrong one had barely any sauce and no taste.
"Decent pizza but awful service. They made us wait 30 minutes even though there were a ton of tables open. They brought us upstairs to more empty tables and sat 3 of us at a small high top. We ordered a lot of food so we pulled another small table to make room since there were so many empty ones. A larger woman with a lot of star tattoos came over and said we cannot just move tables and she needs to check with the hostess to see if anyone needs the table. We said that was fine and she can take the table if it is needed. She said NO I NEED TO TAKE IT NOW and moved it away from us. We then moved to a booth and noticed no one even sat in that room with the high tops the whole 2.5 hours we were there. We asked for new plates after our salad was eaten for the pizza and she said ""ok but you have to save your forks"" in a very snotty tone. We asked if we could please have new forks and she just walked away. She came back with napkins only and said ""I guess I'll have to go clean new forks for you."" Her attitude was horrible the entire time we were there. Very bad experience."
"I really wanted to like Pequod's, but I can't say that I do. Honestly, I think I would rather have the bland tourist trap pizzas (Giordano's, Gino's, and Uno) over this. Great deep dish needs a good sauce, cheese, and a good crust at a minimum. Here's why I think Pequod's is merely alright--nothing special. Pequod's sauce is pretty unremarkable, I don't think it had much of a taste quite honestly. My deep dish did not have much cheese either, considering most competitor pizzas put up to 2"" of cheese in a deep dish. Finally, my biggest complaint about Pequods is the crust! I know alot of people rave about it but I thought it was gross. This is not pizza crust, it is like a spongy cake! To me, pizza crust should be buttery and crunchy, not cake-like and bland. Oh, not to mention it looks and tastes burnt. However, Pequod's fans call it ""carmelized."" Like I said I wanted to like it but I just don't understand its appeal when there are so many better options in Chicago."
"We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday night only to find that there is a 45 min. wait for a table. I would think that would be a good sign. Not so much. We waited a hour and 20 min. for our table. They highly suggest that you order your pizza while you are waiting so it is ready when you sit down. Yeah that didn't work either. We waited another 30 min. for our pizza. The pizza was just ok. The sauce had no flavor and it was mostly doughy not cheesy. To top of the aggravation of the wait, the service was terrible. Our server seemed aggravated when we asked for water. We had to ask the hostess for more drinks and we had to ask the manager for napkins. Overall our experience took 21/2 hours  and by the time we left the place was wall to wall people. I thought I was at a nightclub not a pizza joint."
"Like Cristin M. I did not know going in that pan was ""the thing"". I really don't see how that could have made me like this pizza though. I ordered a small thin crust pizza with ground beef, basil, and mushroom. The ground beef was not GROUND. They should have called it meatball pizza. In addition, the meat tasted like crap. I ended up picking it all off just to make the pizza edible. And basil? Please, there was hardly any in there! Even that couldn't add flavor to the lackluster sauce on this pizza. It tasted no better than Chef Boyardee. Really!I came over here for the first time after a killer kickboxing session at Bally's across the street. (I know, counterproductive.) I had hardly had a bite all day and I was starving. I also wanted to catch the Monday Night Football game. Pequod's had the game on, but the volume was so low you could barely hear the commentary. Come on; this is a casual pizza joint. Turn up the volume!! The service was good enough, but was the pizza?This Pequod's reminds me of an alt-pizza joint. Like you have to be wearing a goofy winter hat, be a man with crazy long hair, or be wearing skinny jeans to really fit in. Funny, cute, and adds to the stlye and originality of the place. Maybe next time I stop in I'll get the pan pizza, add garlic and gardinera for a flavor boost and ask them to TURN UP THE GAME!"
"i wish there were separate ratings for food and service. the food was great. the service...well, the service left an amazing amount to be desired.i suppose to should say that it was the ending service, the girl in the blackhawks jacket, that came from behind the bar and in one fail swoop ended an affiliation i will ever have with the restaurant.  my best friend hosted a birthday party for her daughter and at the end, we all felt that we were really being rushed out of the party room. my boyfriend went to use the restroom and came back to find his beer gone. now that ordinarily is just cause for annoyance...however, we had been making trips up and down the back steps to load gifts and decor into the car. please note that we had done this same thing bringing the decor in and the only people who doing this were the friends of the parents who were trying hustle getting things out since, as i mentioned before, we were already being rushed. upon our, literally, last trips (there were 4 of us) down the steps to take the final things down. we were told we could not use the steps. it was a little confusing, as we had been using them for a half hour and had used them to bring everything in.but as we were walking the final things down, the dark haired girl in the blackhawks jacket sang down the steps ""well, just wait until you try to come back in and youre locked out"" meanwhile, my boyfriend was sitting upstairs and overheard her telling another server triumphantly, ""well, just wait until they try to get back in, i've locked the doors and they are just going to have to deal with it."" i'm not certain what rules we were breaking, as we had been using the doors several times. i'm also not certain why it mattered, it's a straight shot down and saved us from walking repeatedly through the entire busy restaurant with armloads of gifts and decor. however, what really was perplexing was the attitude of this dark haired bartender in the blackhawks jacket. it was as though she was happy to have caused us additional problems. as though someone who had just paid the bill for pizza and beers for a party of roughly 50 would not merit some polite consideration. at the time, we were so busy getting the cars and the kids loaded that no one had time to deal with the rudeness of the girl in the blackhawk jackets, but it was decided that we would never return there. If we were in the wrong, then we would apologize, however, to be treated so incredibly rudely for merely trying to do accommodate the feeling of being pushed out of the room quickly is insanely poor customer service and to be ""proud"" of causing your clients extra problems is indicative of someone who should NOT work in the service industry."
"I didn't have the deep dish.  I had the thin crust.  I did not like the taste of the sauce or the cheese mix on this pizza tho, So I do not think that I would have like the deep dish if it used the same.I actually didn't like it enough to finish eating, I just ate candy at the movies.I did however like the fried zucchini!"
"I'm surprised by all of the positive reviews! Maybe next time (if there is going to be a next time) I'll try dining in versus delivery.One of my co-workers raves about this place. So one rainy, lazy night, I gave them a call.I ordered a normal cheese pizza with fresh garlic. I don't know if they thought I said extra onions or what, but geez! The entire pie tasted of onions! Well, onions and cardboard. Honestly, I think I've gotten better crusts from Domino's.I'll stick with Art of Pizza for now, thanks."
"Worst pizza ever!  2 large thin crust pizzas, 3 iced teas, 1 diet coke, 1 salad, 1 cup of soup & 1 order of poppers cost $94!!!!  That was with a 25% discount for a burnt pizza!! Never again Pequod's!!!!"
"Don't believe the hype.  Tried the thin crust...where's the sauce?  And so flavorless, forget about complex flavors I couldn't even taste salt.  In their defense I got a mushroom slice and there were a ton of mushrooms, but that's it.  I guess I have to try the deep dish to see what's the big deal, but for now red baron would be better than pequod's thin crust."
"Our experience tonight with their delivery service was abysmal.  I called at 6:08pm to place an order, knowing that their delivery times tend to be on the long side.  I was told that we should have our pizza delivered in 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours - no problem.  2 hours and 20 minutes later, I called to check on the ETA for our dinner and was then told that at the time I called they had changed delivery estimates to 2 hours 30 minutes.  Okay, no problem - I was told on that call that our driver was out and our meal should be delivered soon.  Great!  Forward to 3 hours later, our pizza arrives: the box had been opened, was saturated with grease and the pizza was *cold*.  Our driver even quickly said he could take it back for us.  After handing the nasty box back, I called the restaurant to inform them that we had refused the pizza.  With 1) no apology and 2) total lack of empathy I was told that we could cancel the order, receive a credit, or be sent a ""fresh"" pizza.  I asked for the refund, and the employee on the phone simply said okay and hung up.  I will say that dining at Pequod's is wonderful.  Their pizza is amazing.  But the experience with their delivery tonight & (more importantly) the handling of the negative experience makes me question whether we will give them our business in the future."
"In my opinion, Pequod's pizza is completely overrated.  While the outer crust is indeed very nicely done, the middle is a soggy mess.  The sauce was super salty, and this is the only time in my life EVER that pizza was not better the day after.  I mean really how does that happen?  It is one of the foundational laws of all that is good and right in life, that pizza is always better the day after.  Well not at this joint.  I've tried their pizza several times now, and just don't get it.  And not for nothing, it's not inexpensive either, two pies $50.00 with a couple of toppings?    I know Pequod's is popular and all, but not with this girl."
"As someone who's born and raised in Chicago, I'm surprised that so many people like this place.  I feel like I'm eating bread covered with tomato sauce and a tiny bit of cheese. Yuck. Definitely wayyyy more places I'd rather eat then pizza from this place."
After getting a tip off on yelp about this place I decided to try it.  We ordered the deep dish pizza and I guess you need to order taste on the side.  The pizza tasted like bread with sauce (as if the sauce was water).  There are other pizza spots that are better and closer to the city-city.
"We will NEVER go back!  So this is the second year in a row that I had a decent sized group go to Pequods to celebrate my birthday.  Last year, although I had called to confirm my reservation numerous times, they did not have enough seats for my whole party, nor would they have even been able to fit everyone at one table, so part of my group had to be separated.  A booth opened nearby, so it wasn't the end of the world.  For some reason we decided to go back again this year (probably just because pizza is an easy thing to deal with for a big group to share).  Again, I had called numerous times to confirm everything with our reservation to ensure we did not encounter any problems.  I was assured everything was ready.  We got there early/on time for our 8:00 reservation, and were told that there was another party seated where they were planning on seating us, and we'd have to wait for them to leave.  There were 10 of us waiting around and it was HOT and CROWDED.  There was nowhere for us to stand and they apparently did not know how to regulate the temperature in the restaurant.  FINALLY, after waiting 45 minutes after our reservation time, we were seated (probably because after 35 minutes I finally asked the party that was at 'our table' if they would be leaving any time soon, which I would NEVER normally do, but at that point we were pretty hungry and pretty pissed, and the manager clearly wasn't going to do anything about it).  All of that being said, I understand sometimes things like that happen, but ALWAYS when I've been in a situation along the lines of the restaurant screwing something up, they've tried to do something to accommodate us.  This manager (Sean) only offered to pick up the tab on ONE pitcher of beer (again, there were 10 of us who had waited 45 minutes for our table, plus another 20 for the pizzas we had pre-ordered), and even that was only after I had asked him to do something for us.  Seriously? The best you could do is one pitcher of beer for a party of 10 people?? Pathetic.I will say that I actually felt bad for the waitress.  She was VERY nice and I wish her all the best in finding a much better place to work than Pequod's, as I can't begin to comprehend why she (or anyone else for that matter) would want to work there.In any case, we will NEVER go back to Pequod's after that AWFUL experience.  There is MUCH better pizza out there with MUCH better restaurant management."
"Wow, what a difference a few years makes.  This pizza, frankly, stinks.  If there was cheese on this pizza, I couldn't find it.  Here's the ratio: 96% bread, 3% sauce, and 1% toppings.  Excluding cheese.  Just...wow.  So not good.  I like the caramelized crust.  I'll give Pequod's that crust, but nothing else.  I just can't get behind a deep dish pizza that has no cheese on it.  (And I hasten to add that we ordered a straight-up cheese pizza, and one that was half cheese, half mushroom.  More like half mushroom, half nothing but sauce.)  People love this stuff, and I mean....why?  Maybe they don't like cheese anymore."
"Okay, it's great that this place serves pizza and beer late night and service is stellar.  But I can get over the fact that the pizza was below average in taste.  I think we ordered a pan pizza, which had 2 inches of dough, topped with sauce, then the meat.  It looked great, but tasted like pizza your mom made when you were a kid."
I've not ordered deep dish pizza in a very long time.  My experience was that there was more ingredients and cheese- this particular deep dish was more pizza dough- I mean way too much dough.  So it's definitely back to thin crust for me and I've found that the best thin comes from Johns pizzaria on western ave.
"We watched a movie and went to Pequod's across the street. I have heard so much about it and was excited to finally eat there. I LOVE deep dish and heard that the crust here was awesome. After waiting for 30 minutes, our pizza came out all yummy looking. It was just good, not awesome, just good."
"If you like a pan pizza with a thick (at least 0.5 inch) doughy bottom layer of crust, little cheese, little sauce, tiny outer crust/edge, then this is the place for you.  I'm not a fan of these types of pizzas with the thick bottom layer of dough.  I like a good sauce and would like my pizza to have decent layer of it, but this one had little.  I had a sausage, pepperoni, green pepper, and onion pizza.  The sausage was ok and came in big chunks (up to 2 inches long), the pepperoni was large but thin, and the veggies were decent size and good.  Their caramelized crust was like taffy in texture, nothing special.  I felt that the pizza simply had way too much dough on the bottom.  I, too, heard much hype about this place, I just didn't care for it."
"I know I'm just about the only person in Chicago who HATES Pequod's Pizza, but I do, much to the dismay and chagrin of my Pequod's-loving boyfriend. I hate the ""carmelized cheese"" on the crust. People, it's BURNT cheese! Granted, I've only had it once, and maybe it was just an off day, but I don't have any desire to go back anytime soon."
"Eew.  The pizza tasted like rubber.  I was really excited to try this place out, but I was very, very disappointed.  The staff was nice, but no beer specials and bad pizza don't mix to well in my book (2 tap beers, Large 1 topping thin crust pizza was $30).  Too bad.  I rarely disagree this much with my fellow Yelpers, but I gotta go with Molly McB on this one and give this place a 2 (which is almost being too nice)."
"i am not going to lie. i was really jazzed about ordering from here. but, let's be honest here, it didn't blow me away. i was just wondering when the heavens would open and rays of light would shine down on the pizza...illuminating it with POWER. will it happen with my first bite? 7th bite? after the pizza is done and i am washing the plate?nope, just bland deep dish...2.5"
"Not the best pizza and definitely slow. I think this place serves a purpose and if convenient then there is no reason not to eat here. But, there is also no reason to go here."
I have had better!! A lot better!!! First my order was messed up I ordered a Pepperoni & Sausage and got Pepperoni and Green pepper!!!. Went back and they got me another one only the sausage was not cooked in the pizza with the cheese but just laid on TOP!!! won't be back there ever again. Bad thing I love good pizz and will travel for it( I regularly go back to the south side to my fave thin crust pizza place.
"I guess I don't get it. I was all psyched to try the caramelized cheese everyone raved about and... the quarter inch of burned cheese around the edge of my pizza just didn't really set my panties on fire the way everyone made it sound like it would. It was pretty good pizza, but not the best I've ever had by any means. And, this is weird, but I really felt like about 45% of the staff was just repeatedly walking by my table and just starring at me. It was creepy. I won't go back unless my husband really loved it and makes a special trip...but I think he's just as happy with the 5 places right by our house. Sorry, dudes!"
"Not a fan of this pizza.  I had been wanting to try this for a long time, but nervous about straying away from the good old standbys- namely Giordano's and Lou Malnati's.  But on Saturday I was hungover and decided to be a little adventurous since I figured just about any food would help the situation.  Not so.  The carmelized crust just tasted burnt to me.  I didn't like the flavor of the sauce, and there didn't seem to be much cheese, just crust.  I also ordered the hot wings, not hot at all, mostly fat, and the ranch sauce has spilled in the container on the way over to me so the wings were already drenched with it and soggy.  I understand wings are in no way their specialty, but all I was looking for was decent.  I'm not going to make this mistake twice."
I am a firm believer that dinning at a restaurant is more than about just the food. It is an experience and for that I am giving Pequod's a bad review. The food itself was good although certainly not the best pizza in Chicago. The reason I probably will never go back was the service. I arrived at this establishment on Saturday night and as expected there was a line. I asked for the wait time and was told 45 minutes. That's a long time but this restaurant's notoriety preceded it and I was willing to wait and wait I did. After an hour I asked approximately how much longer the wait would be and I was told 15-20 minutes. Feeling very discontent but understanding that the majority of the laborious task of waiting was already completed I opted to stay. Wait...Wait...Wait...I ended up waiting for almost two hours. Was the host appoligetic? No. Was the owner? No. Did the waitress blame us when our pizza which we had preordered was late? YES! It's unfortunate that I had such a bad experience as I had heard a lot about this restaurant and it was a letdown to be so disappointed. There's better pizza and service out there. Don't settle for Pequod's.
"I attended Pequod's for the lunch special. I was disappointed to say the least. After a few sips of my Diet Coke I noticed something floating in it. I asked the waitress for a new drink about 10 minutes before we received our food. I did not receive a new one until about 10 minutes after we received our food. I did not receive an apology for the wait, or the fact that I received a drink with a mysterious object floating in it.The quality of the pizza was sub-par at best. The sauce is too sweet and there is way too much of it.  There was also way too much crust which took away from the taste.  I had heard raves about the ""caramelized"" crust, but I was not at all impressed.  It' taste was a  mixture of tasteless dough and burned dough.My experience was enough to convince me to not return."
I was so so disappointed when I got tried Pequod's for the first time this week. I was really craving cheesy deep dish pizza that was new to me so I came on yelp and saw all the great reviews. The pizza was delivered and got here fast enough. I don't like that the pizza is basically all crust. Most deep dishes have a good percentage of topping and crust. But my pizza wa 90% crust...yuck!! I was just very disappointed and won't be ordering from here again!!
"Don't get me wrong, this is far better than Domino's or Pizza Hut.  But in a town where you have delicious thin and thick-crust pies, Pequod's just doesn't cut it.  They are most known for their thick crust pizza, which has a layer of burnt cheese around the crust.  That's a nice touch, but it's not enough to offset the mediocre sauce and too-thick bottom crust.  Again, you won't hate Pequods, but there's just no real reason to go."
"I used to live in Chicago and remember 8 years ago when Pequod's was a hole-in-the-wall with plastic tables, no ambience, very good service, and outstanding, very unique deep-dish pizza.  Things have changed a lot.  I recently returned to Chicago with 3 buddies for a cubs game and I was looking forward to Pequod's.  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.We were told the wait for a table was 25 minutes.  It took over an hour.  We bid our time at the (small) bar and despite complaining about the wait, were not offered any ""prizes"" at the bar as is usually the custom at a restaurant where the wait is much longer than promised (IE no free drinks).We ordered deep dish pizza (of course) and  some wings for  appetizers.  The wings came after the pizza and weren't very good anyway.  And I forgot how bad the mixed green salad is (why they continue to put canned black olives on it I just don't understand).I won't lie and say the pizza sucked.  It didn't.  But it was not as good as it used to be.  The crust was dry and flavorless, and they were cheapskates with the toppings (one piece of sausage on each slice?).  We were stuffed after 2 slices each, and we're not light eaters.The coup de grace was that a grossly drunk college student barfed at the table next to us.  Thank god we were just finishing up, but still.  There was no discount offered, no freebie, not even anything like a sincere apology.  And the restaurant didn't even kick out the drunk idiot!I hate to say it but I'd look elsewhere for an authentic deep dish chicago pizza experience.  I'd still look beyond the tourist traps in river north (IE gino's east, uno, due) but I'd recommend malnati's over pequod's at this point.  Sorry guys."
"I know so many people who love this place.  Can't explain it.  I think it's like eating a week old unsugary cake with a too sweet pizza sauce and too much cheese on top.  The crust is as thick as your wrist and the cheese gets all burnt around the sides of the pan.  The service blows.   Like a couple of other places I've eaten, they employ good looking entitled hipsters who seem to think they're 'above' the job they're doing but not so above it that they choose to eat from the dumpster in the back."
"came here not to long ago with my girlfriend, this place is ran by a sorority house, got sat by the door when there was clearly open tables, not to mention nobody came to give us water. ill never come here again. the manager or what ever look like he was a leader of a boy scout company."
"Apparently I'm the only person who has never heard of Pequod's (judging from the number of Yelp reviews!) and also didn't know that the pan pizza was THE thing to order when you eat here!  My friend and I ended up here after Webster Wine Bar was too busy and we needed a quick bite and drink before a movie across the street.  Since we were limited on time, we ordered the thin crust.  Not impressive.  The crust was really bland and just didn't add anything to the pizza.  It was lacking on flavor as a whole.  I will give the place points for having TONS of space for seating, with the entire 2nd floor filled with dining spots.  The service was quick too.  They got us in and out in under an hour.  I would definitely go back and give them another shot, except order the pan pizza, since that's what people like them for."
"Yikes! I haven't ordered Pequod's in a long time but my husband and I decided to take a break from our usual picks- Peace, Lou Malnatis and Roots. I can't stress how much I regret that decision.  Maybe our pizza was an isolated incident but it was horrible. We spent $40 on a large pizza and a Caesar salad, neither of which was edible. Aside from the fact that the pizza weighed about 15lbs- it was so soggy it looked like bread dipped in soup- I even tried to salvage it with a few minutes in the toaster oven- failed attempt. The salad was wilted and smothered in dressing- Who dumps dressing all over a salad when it's carry out?  I very rarely write reviews, especially bad ones-but I was so irritated at the waste of money and food I couldn't help but write this. Maybe they offer an uncut option to avoid the sogginess? With so many great reviews I can only imagine that our order just came out bad because I assure you that the quality we received would not warrant any return customers."
"I had wanted to try this pizza spot since the mid-90's when I first became aware of it. So I finally did on a Friday night, and boy was I disappointed. Surprisingly disappointed. Two of us ordered and shared the Pequod's salad and a medium deep dish sausage/mushroom pizza. The salad was OK. The pizza was just a big sloppy mess, in my opinion on a way-too-thick crust. Gobs of flavorless tomato sauce as if I were eating lasagna on top of baked bread. Just did not do the trick for me and I wished I had taken my visitor from out or town someplace else, like Lou M's or Bacino's. I felt as if I were in some college joint, maybe in Wisconsin, eating a bad version of Chicago deep dish pizza. On the positive side, the service was good. And the price was right.  But it's just not this boy's cup o' tea when it comes to 'za. It's a rare occasion that I eat deep dish pizza, so when I do, it won't be here."
"I was so excited to go here and eat burnt cheese!!!!! After two buses and a long walk I finally found myself drooling over other peoples pan pizza...ordered the pequod salad, actually used real lettuce and it was huge- easily enough for 2 people, maybe 3.  Nothing extrordinary but satisfactory.  The pizza was a killjoy.  What is up with the bisquit crust?  First off- the crust is almost and inch thick and 3/4 of it is semi-crunchy like a british bisquit.  The bf/cook said that they precook the crust so they can melt the cheese on high heat and get the burnedness...but I wasn't into it(the crust)... and another thing- It's called Salt people- use it. Screw our blood pressure. Bland sauce, bland crust.  Not terrible but not worth the two buses and long walk.  I would go back if a friend insisted on it- but I was definitely disappointed."
"It was just ok as far as pizza goes. The biggest disappointment was the crust. It didn't have any flavor, very bland. And I tend not to like places that cut their pizza in squares. Cutting it this way creates 4 weird tiny triangle pieces that consist of mostly crust and, if you are lucky, one bite of cheese and toppings.  It also creates that one sloppy piece in the middle that no one wants and you can't pick up cuz it doesn't have a crust to hold on to. I've had better pizza and the atmosphere and waitstaff was only so-so."
"Something horrible happened between 1999 and now - Pequod's began to suck. I haven't been there since I was a kid, but a recent delivery experience will ensure that I will not be adding Pequod's back into my dining rotation. Several things led to Pequod's demise: First, delivery took an hour and a half. That's way too long for thin crust. Second, it was $45 for two pizzas - a medium and a large - and I didn't see any specks of gold on my pizza, so I was left wondering why it was so costly. Finally, the pizza itself kinda, sorta, really had no flavor. Our spinach tasted like basil (did they mix up the ingredients?), and the crust tasted like bread from 1982. A lackluster sauce and flavorless mozzarella were the final nails in the ""Pequod's sucks"" pizza coffin. Oh well, another day, another pizza joint."
"After reading about how great this place was, I decided to have a medium three topping pizza and a six-pack of coke delivered to my house.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  The pizza arrived cold and they charged $9.00 for a six-pack of coke.  What a rip!   The bill was over $40 not including tip.   The pizza after I reheated was okay, but by far not the best.  It's not even in my top 10.  Maybe it's better if you eat it there."
"I ordered their pizza by the slice (thin crust) and had to wait before getting it.  The bottom crust was crispy, thin, and charred (like a cracker) which I did not like. I also tried their deep dish, and it was nothing to write home about."
"The place was about half full when my boyfriend and I got there, but they still put us at the smallest table in the place, right next to the wait station. No thanks. We moved to a slightly larger table.  Ordered our pizza and after waiting about 35-40 minutes, a man came to our table to explain that our pizza had gotten burned, sorry but it will be 15 more minutes. Okay, stuff happens. So we wait the 15 minutes, then another 10. Finally a pizza comes to our table, and it's the wrong pizza. We ordered thin, it's thick. Waited over an hour from the time we ordered and never got to eat, because they screwed it up not once, but twice, and I wasn't about to wait around for a 3rd screw up. We got an apology and they gave us a $15 gift certificate (which seems a bit scant for such a royal screw up), so at least they felt bad about it, but I'm not going back."
"probably the most dirtiest pizza place i ever been to,there was napkins,straw wrappers,and other stuff on the floor, my fiends and i sat at a booth and when i went to put my arm around my buddy to tell him something i got a handful of old pasta that seemed to be sitting around for a while,i ordered the chicken fingers with fries because i wasn't that hungry and the chicken had no flavor what so ever and the fries were worst, i asked for ketchup for my fries the waitress brings me four packets of ketchup and a bowl, didn't have a ketchup bottle,while i was eating my food i witnessed the waitress try to throw garbage into to the trash and she knew she clearly missed and didn't bother to pick it up, but when i seen the manager drop a knife along with a napkin both together,he just picked up the knife and not the napkin and they were right next to each other i knew this place is DIRTY.the only reason i gave it one star is because one of my buddies like the salad and said i'd be bogus if didnt give them at least one star."
"So against my will i went to try them again (girlfriends idea), she said we should order ahead so when we walk the 5 mins it takes to cross the street it will be there, and we can enjoy lunch and not spend most of it starving.  Ok, so at 11:55am i call them and tell them i want to place an order, extra cheese caramelized crust, simple. I ask how long will it take to make it, she says approx 25-30 mins, ok so i tell her i work right across the street and i will walk over there at 12:25. everything seems to be going good, I'm in high hopes. Arrive there, everyone was friendly, seated in a corner booth, for more than 2, not the one we wanted but ill take it. So after saying multiple times that i ordered ahead, they finally understand. so here comes 11:50 roughly 20 mins after we were seated, almost an hour from when i placed the order and no food. I give my gf a snared look and told her she better be the one to ask whats going on, so to put this shortly, my gf asked the hostess why it took so long for our pizza to get there even though we ordered ahead of time. She said they don't make it until people are seated that way if they don't arrive at the time they say the pizza wont be cold, we told her that whoever we talked to on the phone was told we are across the street and will walk over at that time. She then said she would talk to the girl who answers the phone, we both thought ok, makes sense they want to bring out a nice hot, fresh pizza. We bite into the pizza..... and its luke warm!!! REALLY?!?!  And i know its not their fault, but there was a nat flying around us the whole time and it just didn't help the whole situation.  Second thought, that is their fault!!! So i tried walking in and ordering took 45 mins, 2nd time i order ahead and it took just as long. Once against great pizza ruined by bad service ;-/"
"Pequod's used to be one of my favorite pizza spots in Chicago; after my recent experience with them I will never order from the again.After and hour and 40 minutes of placing my order I still had no pizza.  I called to ask the status, the girl who answered was less than pleasant.  When the pizza finally arrived, it was completely wrong.  Wanted vegetarian and got all meat toppings.  I called to complain and was only offered a $5 discount on my next pizza (oh excuse me, they would send me a new pizza but I think after an 1:40 minutes I would've been on to my next meal.)   At least offer a free pizza!!  NEVER ordering from them again."
"Was seriously underwhelmed, by both the pizza and the service. On Saturday at 6pm, we counted at least nine staff members, four of whom were just standing around the hostess station looking surly while we sat dying for refills. Pizza was eh; not really thin crust, more like a hand-tossed, and pretty bland. Breaded zucchini was good (little chips vs. the standard fries). Will not go back unless Potbelly's and Thai Wild Ginger next door are both closed."
"Very let down. I was promised the best pizza in Chicago by so many friends. When I finally got ""the famous pequods Pizza"" they had raved about, it was mostly a lot of bread and very little sauce. I'm a big fan of pan and deep dish Chicago style pizza but this just did not live up to the hype. The crust was very good, but there was just too much of it compared with the rest of the toppings. There are many places in Chicago I would try before Pequod's."
"Maybe it was a bad day for them, maybe the staff is int he middle of post Christmas doldrums but we had a horrible experience here.  Where to start?  We walked in at lunch, when someone finally noticed us standing in front near the front we were directed to sit in the only blind spot allowing a view of the TV's despite ample additional seating.  Upon asking for another seat eyes rolled and uncheerfully relented.  After taking our drink and food orders it took a good ten minutes to get our drinks despite a sparsely filled restaurant.  We began to notice that we were seriously getting hungry and checking the clock.  After attempting to flag down our waitress we got the hostess who we could see visually scrambling to even find our order in the kitchen.  She eventually sauntered back and said it would only be another 15 minutes and it takes 25 to make a pizza.  I explained our wait was already 40 minutes to which she disagreed despite not even being our waitress.  I told her that we came in as sportcenter came on her main TV, that means it was 12pm it was now 12:43.  She asked if I was sure and I explained I had been watching ESPN for 15 years so yeah I am pretty sure.  10 minutes later our waitress finally came with our pizza and took our drink refills about 20 minutes past the time they were empty.  Now at last we had the long awaited pizza that I had long heard was the best in the area.  In a word it was crap, well more like uncooked crap. I am not sure not being a chef at any time but I assume all the cheese should melt and the crust should not be doughy enough use as pool stick chalk in a pinch. The Beef was nasty, the peppers were fresh a week ago at best and the sauce was cold in patches.  It was atrocious and beat out the service for ""worst in show"" of this circus act.  I can understand being off at times but at lunch? With a half filled restaurant?  It was amateur hour in virtually every way, never coming back to this mess again."
"Let me start by saying its a nice place you can go get some beers and pizza.  BUT this is not by any means Chicago or Deep Dish pizza, this is PAN pizza.  Sorry guys Deep Dish pizza is not a bunch of dough, for all you who say this is Chicago's best deep dish you are sadly mistaken.  For all you out of towners who thought you had deep dish in Chicago you were wrong and wronged by who ever told you that or took you there.  I went there with a friend who told me I had to come and try this place as it was his favorite, it was a good pan pizza, but I was expecting deep dish.   deep dish can be found at giordanos, lous, ginos, ect... not saying those are my favorites but they are deep dish.  In closing Do NOT go to pequods if you are looking for deep dish, but they do have pan pizza which is about 2"" of dough with a little sauce and cheese."
"The pizza's fine, I guess, although we hardly got to enjoy it because it arrived 40 minutes after we ordered it and had to stuff it down our throats to avoid missing ""Inception."" The waitress almost acted shocked that we needed our food faster than 40 minutes after we ordered it to make a movie. Uh, you're right across the street from a movie theater!!! Shouldn't the first question be to anyone showing up, ""Are you going to see a movie?"" It's literally the closest restaurant to Webster movie theater. I can get delivery pizza to me in less than 40 minutes and yet I couldn't get pizza in a restaurant in 40 minutes. I certainly would never go there prior to a movie unless the movie started past 9pm and I was there for lunch."
"Ordered delivery, was slow but arrived hot. Had a medium thin-crust with mushrooms and olives. The thin crust was really not all that--it had a very doughy and chewy texture to it and not in a good way. Toppings/cheese and tomato sauce were yummy but a good crust makes a pizza."
Went to Pequod's for dinner.  Was not impressed.  Got a small thick and a small thin.  It was not thin.  More like hand tossed.  Had no real flavor.  Thick was OK.  Not worth it by any account.
"The thin crust is dull and tasteless. I guess I was suppose to order the deep dish but, I will not try this pizza again."
"I love Pequod's Pizza, but I had to give them one star because their delivery is HORRIBLE!  They have messed up my order at least 3 different times when I ordered pizza from them for delivery.  The pizza is amazing, but they just can never get their delivery right.......it's really sad!  I ordered a vegetarian pizza and the guy brought me a pepperoni pizza! I almost threw up from the smell of it!  Then, when I called them to tell them about how I was delivered the wrong pizza, they put me on hold for 10 minutes to figure out what they were going to do and then finally asked me if I wanted a ""credit"" for next time.  I told them, Hell NO! Tell your delivery man to come back and take this pizza and give me my money back!  They have very poor customer service on the phone.  My suggestion is to dine in, Don't order pizza for delivery from this place!"
"This pizza is fine, but not for me.  The pan style for which they are well known, is not my  favorite, so admittedly I have a bias.  The sauce had decent flavor but was applied sparingly and I found the cheese lacking.  Ingredients seemed fresh and the little ""char"" on the edge of the dough/crust did have good flavor, but overall the taste and flavor of your average bite was lacking.  If pan style is your favorite - I prefer thin crust and deep dish more - then this place is probably worth a try and you may find it a 3 or 4 star - but otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
"My heart hurt while eating this pizza-- and not for reasons you would think. Having read fellow Yelpers' reviews, I had extremely high expectations for Pequod's pizza.  But, sadly sadly sadly, this pizza is so very overrated. So, in addition to my heart, the hurt spread to my head because I couldn't quite fathom why this pizza is so beloved. It is a ridiculously thick slab of unappetizing crust (so much so that I sliced most of the bottom half off), followed by a nearly non-existent layer of cheese, slathered with sweet, chunky sauce (which was probably the only good thing), and finished off with a meager sprinkling of your topping of choice. Oh-- I forgot to mention that the outer edge of the crust is lined with black, burnt cheese which they call ""caramelized cheese crust,"" but this can easily be achieved by throwing mozzarella, parmesan, or your preferred cheese on a hot skillet and letting it sit there until it burns. I adore pizza. Really truly utterly adore pizza. I do not know what this round concoction was. It broke my heart, made me unjustifiably fatter, and took $20 of hard-earned money that could have been spent on something more worth it."
I was there last night sitting in the upstairs and a roach crawled along the side of our table.  I will NEVER go there again.  It's ashame because I love their pizza.
"they have their good days, and off days....sometimes the pizza is GREAT....other times its like a totally different crew is making them , I'd like to see more consistencey ...I do love their pies though!"
"I was disappointed by Pequod's...had heard so many great things that I was expecting something really extraordinary.   I thought the pizza was too heavy, too doughy, too many toppings.  For deep dish I really prefer My Pie, which has a much lighter crust."
"Blah--do not order their thin crust pizza by the slice! I ordered a slice with pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. The man said it would only be 7 minutes...cool! When it came out it looked like they already had a pepperoni pizza cooked, and then just threw on mushrooms and olives on top and threw it back in the oven for 5 minutes. It was really gross because the mushrooms were still raw. I will have to go back to try their deep dish everyone raves about."
"Not so great, but convenient if your by the the Webster theater and need a quick bite!!"
"My family and I have been fans of Pequod's for decades, and I've never written a review on Yelp before. But I just had an experience worth sharing. White taking refuge from a thunderstorm, I decided to have lunch at Pequod's. I ordered the special which is a drink and personal pizza. When I was about half way through, a guy who had not been my server asked if I would like another drink. And I said sure I'll have another Diet Coke. He neglected to mention that you don't get free refills on the lunch special. So my 6 dollar lunch went up to $8.57. I realize this isn't a huge amount of money, but I strongly feel he had an obligation to tell me I would be charged for another drink. When I asked the hostess after I received the check, she blew me off. A smarter business move would have been to have taken the charge off and apologized. But I guess they don't care about customer relations.  The whole act just struck me as shady, and I will probably go to Malnati's more often than Pequod's...no matter how good their pizza is."
"I've always heard so many good things about Pequod's for years but never tried it until a few months ago. Sadly, we were very disappointed. It wasn't bad pizza because there really isn't such a thing as bad pizza. However, there is such a thing as average pizza and Pequaod's in my opinion was that....just average. Nothing on this pizza stood out to me as being anything special. I was hoping to love it. From all the good reviews I've read, I expected to love it. After finally trying the pizza, all I could say was ""this is it""? Again not that if was bad or anything like that. The problem was it was very average and forgettable. I think there are far better choices out there and I believe some of the hype and popularity of Pequod's is just that. It almost has the feel or gives the impression that it's cool to go to Pequod's so that's why people do it. Would I go again if only based on the pizza? No."
