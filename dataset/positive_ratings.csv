"My faaave deep dish in chicago with an N of two. The crust is super buttery and less soggy more crispy than other deep dish I've tried. Pizza pie was my favorite. Pro tip, you can order take out and eat at the BYOP (bring your own pizza) bar and library across the street.  If you're traveling to chicago and can only try one deep dish spot, this is it!!"
"Finally got to try Pequod's, service was a 3 and the pizza was a 5. To my taste, it was way better  than pizza's from usual Chicago chains. I went there on a  Friday around 2pm and was super happy to not have to wait hours to get a table. Regarding the restaurant, it looks like a dark dive bar, nothing fancy. We didn't get explanation for the menu (it would have been appreciated). Basically you get to choose between 3 regular pizzas and then you can add as many toppings as you want (for an additional charge). I like they have a caramelized crust. You're going for a deep dish, so get your table before you're starving because it takes a long time to cook haha! as delicious warmed up in the oven the next day! I got a salad to wait, it was okay, it comes with a plastic cup of red vinegar and another one of olive oil, not the best one though. As far of the pizza, the ingredients were fresh, the dough was good and we got some to go! (We were so hungry we forgot to take a pic of it) I'll go back but probably to take out."
Easily the best deep dish in Chicago!I don't have much more to add to this page but I will recommend getting extra sauce and extra cheese....it really makes a difference!
"This style deep dish is the thick crust pan style pizza, even though it wasn't the super cheesy topped off with sauce on top that I assumed all Chicago deep dish was this is still some really good pizza.The restaurant itself is kind of a dive sports bar, lots of seating & lots of tv, a good variety of beers & appetizers to go with the pizza selection."
"First time having deep dish pizza!Wonderful place -- didn't have to wait too long and the service was so nice! Gave us a great recommendation for pizza and was so friendly!We got one of the custom deep dish ones and shared among three people. We got the smallest size and we still couldn't finish it. Would definitely say its a great bargain for the price and would warn you to not underestimate their food. We also shared some wings, which I loved as well.Definitely recommend!"
I tried lou malnatis while in chicago and I preferred pequodsLou malnatis fell short for mebut pequods was greatit was only about a 10minute waitbut a 40minute wait for the pizza to come outthe sauce was so good!! and the caramelized/burnt cheese crust was greatgot a large and i only ended up being able to finish one slicetook home the leftovers but the pizza still tasted great after
"Pequod's does not have any pre-made signature pizza toppings like the other popular deep dish spots; instead, all of their pizzas are customizable. With this said, they do not allow pre-ordering your pizza while waiting for your table (probably to ensure you don't skip town, but why would you?!) When my friend and I arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday, the placed was completely packed. There was a 90 minute wait for us, but luckily we found two stools at the bar instead.Since we knew how heavy the pizza was about to be, we started off with a house salad with italian dressing ($4.80). After over an hour later, our small size pan pizza ($11.75) finally arrived. We also added italian beef (+$2.75) and mushrooms (+$1.85) inside too. The pizza was nicely done and that first slice was delicious. All of the ingredients were stuffed into the cheese and marinera sauce being held together in a crunchy crust. As much as I wanted to finish both of my slices, I only got through my second slice halfway. The special part about Pequod's is its customization (you can even do half and half on the pizza to make everyone in the party happy). But because of this, they also take much longer. Thankfully I was not too hungry or else my patience would have truly been tested here. Although Pequod's is a bit further outside of Chicago, it's still worth the trek over here --but I'd definitely recommend coming here at odd hours to shorten the wait time."
"During a weeklong work trip in Chicago, I knew my co-worker and I had to eat deep dish at one point during the week. I mentioned to our client that we were thinking of Lou Malnati's, and he basically persuaded us to go to Pequod's instead. In his words, ""Lou Malnati's is good; Pequod's is great.""We arrived around 8PM on a Tuesday, and the place was packed! We got a pager, sat outside to look at the menu, and our pager buzzed within a few minutes. Since it was just us 2, we decided on a small pan pizza with bell peppers and Canadian bacon as toppings (bell peppers were extra topping; Canadian bacon was half extra). Honestly I loved the fact that they offered half toppings because sometimes two people just can't get along! But in this case, my co-worker was vegetarian but I knew I needed some meat.I know there's nothing like Chicago deep dish, and this experience reiterated that. I did feel like the crust was a little thick, but it didn't really change what I thought about the pizza. The crust was AMAZING!! I looked forward to that extra crunch with every slice I ate (I only ate 2).We had zero regrets changing our plans from Lou Malnati's to Pequod's. The World Series was on, and it honestly felt like a place where the locals go. I would absolutely come here again!"
"Awesome deep dish pizza, atmosphere and if possible even better service!  Called ahead and although they do not take reservations will take priority seating.  Good news there, it cut our wait from 60 to 30 minutes.  Plenty of room next door at the Whale Tail for a drink before dinner.  Beeper so we knew when table was ready.  True Chicago style deep dish with a crisp bottom crust.  Delicious!  Staff was running but didn't miss a beat on low drinks and rapid refills.  Appreciated the management sign on graffiti on the walls but only added to the ambiance of a unique location!"
"To my knowledge there are pretty much three iconic Chicago foods, Italian beef, a Chicago hot dog and deep dish pizza.  Of the three, the pizza was the one I had the least interest in trying while we were in town vacationing.  I've had them in various forms before, at an Uno's franchise in NC, Lou Malnati's delivered frozen to cook at home.  You could argue that those are not ""original"" in one way or another but whatever...  I've always been underwhelmed.Still, when in Chicago it seemed somehow wrong not to get deep dish one day so after a Cub's comeback win at Wrigley we went to Pequod's which was my choice after much Yelp research and a couple sightings on Food Network.  The draw to me was the ring of caramelized cheese around the top of the crust.  What an awesome choice it was and not just because of the delicious cheesy ring.  The entire pizza was outstanding. The crust (thick but not too thick, crispy but not greasy) sausage and pepperoni (tasty and plenty of it) and sauce (just pure tomato goodness) made for a really, really good meal.  The ability to get personal sized pizzas made it easy for me to get the meat fest and my wife to get just cheese so no need to even compromise!I guess you can call me a convert and Pequod's gets all the credit.  Oh yeah, we had some buffalo wings before the pizza and they were good as well."
"The last time I was in Chicago and had deep-dish pizza, I got food poisoning (thanks, Lou Malnati's!  Never again!)  But, my cousin really wanted to try some Chicago-style pizza while we were in town for the Chicago Marathon, so I acquiesced on the conditions that 1) we only ate the pizza AFTER the marathon and 2) we ate anywhere BUT Lou Malnati's.After doing some research, we settled on Pequod's and took a taxi over to Chicago's North Side to stuff our faces after finishing the race.  It was about 2 PM when we showed up and this place was PACKED!  Fortunately, we were able to grab a table for two immediately.  As an FYI: Pequod's bakes their pizzas from scratch, and since it's a pan pizza, it takes a bit longer to cook (about 40 minutes), so if you're HANGRY, it's better to call in your order ahead of time by phone.To stave off the runger, we ordered a sampler of their Appetizer Combo, which featured fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, and fried zucchini bites.  I'm not gonna lie, this was pretty unremarkable and not worth writing about, but we were starving and needed something to tide us over til the pizza arrived.When our pizza pie finally got delivered, I could not WAIT to dig in!  Technically, pan pizza is different than deep-dish, but Pequod's pizza is still an experience you can really only find in Chicago.  It features a thick crust with slightly burnt edges (""caramelized,"" as the restaurant calls it) and layers of cheese and sauce, with your choice of toppings piled on (we chose sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers).While my first experience with deep dish at Lou Malnati's left me unimpressed, I really enjoyed the pan pizza at Pequod's.  The crust was thick without being too doughy, and sturdy enough to hold up to all the sauce and cheese without becoming soggy.  The caramelized burnt edges added a nice crunchy texture.  The ingredients tasted fresh and they did NOT skimp on the amount of toppings!  The sauce tasted very tomatoey (in a good way) and not canned.Also, this pizza is FILLING.  Two hungry dudes who had just run 26.2 miles couldn't even finish all six slices of their medium sized pizza.  So come hungry, and bring plenty of friends!OVERALL: 4/5.  Skip the appetizers and go straight for their famous pan pizza.  It's rich, delicious, and worth every single calorie and clogged artery.  I'm sure both NYC and Chicago-style purists can agree that the pizza at Pequod's is darn good!"
"Ordered Pequod's for delivery to our hotel after a long day of traveling. They estimated 2 hours for delivery but it actually came in 1.5 hours which was nice. The pizza was just okay for me. I think I would like to try the thin crust next time. If I were a fan of deep dish, this would be great. They definitely don't skimp on the toppings which is nic"
"Detroit style pizza disguised as Chicago style pizza lol. Pizza is really good thought. Definitely five stars for sure. I called in my pizza and it still took every bit of one hour so be prepared to wait or call it in like I did. Price: They have an amazing lunch special for 5-6 bucks that comes with a drink. I mean that is such a steal! Really good quality pizza for less that ten dollars. It's very filling as well. I was completely full of the person loan pizza special. Food: they call it Chicago style pizza but this reminds me a lot of Detroit style pizza. When I think of Chicago pizza I think of Lou malnatis or Giordano's. Pequod's is a fusion of Chicago meets Detroit. The caramelized crust is something Detroit is know for. I don't think any other Chicago pizza place does their crust like this. I personally love it! Also the bread is very thick with just a little bit of cheese and sauce on top. Check mark  Detroit style pizza. The sauce is a little on the tangy side. Still really good. Glad I was able to get it.  Reminded me a lot of via 313 out of Austin Texas (via 313 is from Detroit) As of right star pizza in Houston Texas makes the best deep fish Chicago pizza I've ever had. The owners are from Chicago. Look them up. Also Windy City pizza in antascacita Texas is number 2. Owner is from Chicago. If you are ever in Houston, try those two out."
"Came here as part of a Chicago pizza tour, was not disappointed. This is one of the 3 main styles of ""Chicago-style"" pizza (in order of thickness, thick to slim): Deep Dish, Pan, Tavern.The pizza here is pan.It's thick, but it's not ""wedding cake"" thick like some of the deep dish can be.The main star of this pizza was the sausage.  It was perfectly spiced.  It made you think ""what's in this?"" in a good way.Service was excellent and beer selection was above average.  Ambiance was like that of a normal, divey bar that has been around for a long time, which I liked."
"When in Chicago, one MUST have deep dish. It just ain't right if you leave the city without tucking into their specialty.Since I've already had Lou Malnati's, I really wanted to try something different this time around. Some quick googling told me Pequod's was THE place for deep dish so off we went. The four of us showed up around lunchtime on a Saturday and were promptly seated. The space is like a no-frills divey bar filled with tchotchkes and old, worn booths. Staff was super friendly and really made us feel welcome.We ended up waiting about 45mins for a large pizza stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms and bell peppers. This baby was FILLING and the caramelized crust was amazing and so freakin' crispy! It was everything deep dish should be; gooey, hearty, and packed with fillings. Each of us ended up eating a slice and we took two to go. TL;DR Fantastic pizza. Just go."
"When visiting Chicago, we visited quite a few Chicago pizza joints and Pequod's was by far our favorite. Pequod's is where the locals go is what we were told, which seemed very true once walking in. It's like your neighborhood sports bar. The pizza here is a pan pizza and not so much a stuffed pizza like some other places. It's got a thick crust with caramelized cheese on the edges, a very delightful sauce, and fresh toppings.  I absolutely loved every bite of this pizza and wish my hometown had something similar. If you're a local, I'm sure you already know about Pequod's. If you're a tourist, make sure you make Pequod's your first pizza stop."
Met up with my husband for a quick lunch date. We ordered the lunch special of the personal pizza and pop for $5! Can't beat that deal. It was my first time here and I am a fan. I love the burnt cheese on the edges! Prob cut and burnt my mouth since I have zero patience once my pizza gets to the table. We also ordered the jalapeño poppers which were basic but always good. Will def be back whenever I am in the area!
"I came here with a few friends with the goal of finally trying out some of Chicago's deep-dish pizza. This place serves pan pizza but based on the way service explained it, this pretty much still counts.This place has a bar and a lot of appetizer options in addition to the pizza. Pan pizza takes a long time to make, but if you get an appetizer and a few drinks, the time will fly by. The fries are delicious and from what I've seen, the appetizers come in awesome portion sizes, so it's definitely worth your buck.The pan pizza coming felt like an early Christmas gift. There is a LOT of pizza and the service helped us by cutting and plating it for us. We got a couple of vegetable toppings on one half and regular cheese on the other half. It turned out to be absolutely delicious and filling. Definitely worth a try and absolutely worth it.Considering that each slice of pan pizza is basically 2 pizza slices equivalent of food, the price is amazing if you split it among a few people. This place is also open pretty late, so this could make for good pregame or post-game food, depending on how you go about your night.Overall, fantastic experience. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area."
"Damn good pizza!  All you need to order is a large deep dish sausage and you are good!  The carmelized crust is outstanding!  If you don't like this pizza, stay home with your frozen pizzas and thin crust appetizers!Get here early, it's packed every night from 6 to 9.Service is good, it's also a Nebraska Cornhusker bar which is a shame."
"Pequod's was the first stop on our epic Chicago Pizza Tour, where we were introduced to our first #pizzastyle: pan pizza. And oh, was it delicious. We were each served a huge, thick slice of their pepperoni and sausage pie, with its hearty layer of house-made red sauce, gooey melted cheese, and topped with amazing meat. Especially the sausage. Omg, that sausage. It was so good I'm seriously considering booking the next flight back to O'Hare. The restaurant had set aside a special seating area just for our group, which was a nice perk of being on the tour cuz this place was hopping. We also got some drinks, and I chose a local beer. Which was sort of a mistake, considering the size of the pizza. The beer was good but I was only able to drink about half of it due to the yummy pizza filling my tummy.  The service was also super friendly, they didn't seem annoyed by us as some restaurants can when you go on one of these food tours.  They were also very efficient, as we were served right away and were able to eat and drink and be out of there in about 30 minutes so we could be off to our next stop. I will definitely return here on my next trip, whenever that may be!"
"Okay I'M SAYING IT. This is the best deep dish in Chicago.We got the pepperoni and sausage medium, and it was everything I would ever want it to be. The crust, the sauce to cheese ratio, the amount of pepperoni on each slice... I'm still dreaming about it.I called in the order ahead of time, and they wouldn't put it in the oven until we were seated - which confused me. Why would I bother calling in ahead of time when I can just order at the table for the same amount of time? Don't see why that is an option. We still waited 30 min for the pizza. It is so out of my way, but I will definitely be back."
"Pequod's was my first ever deep dish and it was sooo good! I went here on my first trip to Chicago with a group of girls and we deliberated over which pizza place to try. Pequod's won and I'm glad they did! We stopped in around 4pm on a Saturday and they were busy but not slammed. We were able to get a table right away. Note that you will still wait 45 minutes for your pizza. It takes some time for them to caramelize the crust and this is what sets Pequod's apart. We ordered two pies for 5 people and we still had leftovers. Deep dish is filling but we also had late dinner reservations so we didn't want to eat too much. I ate the veggie deep dish and it was so good! The crust was hearty and delicious and the cheese was everything. I would like to try a couple of other deep dish spots for the sake of comparison but I can't imagine it getting much better. The service was good and the atmosphere is lively but laid back. I am not sure what part of town we were in because we took a Lyft and I wasn't paying attention. I think this is the only location, though. I would definitely recommend!"
"I may not be from a place that is known for any famous pizza and I am normally a NY style fan...but Pequod's turned me into a deep dish fan as well...BUT as long as it's from here! Peqoud's was our 2nd deep dish place and it blew our minds away. We went on an off time (around 2-3pm) on a Sunday but there was still a little wait (about 15-20 minutes) so we wanted to save time and instead grabbed 2 empty seats at the bar since we know we also have to wait another 45 minutes for the pizza to be cooked. We ordered a small pepperoni and sausage deep dish to share. The crust is covered in melted cooked cheese- which gave the crust a great crunch. The small deep dish was enough for 2 of us. They loaded and I mean loaded the pizza with pepperoni and sausage! And the best thing, it was probably high quality meats because it was not greasy at all. The sausage was probably the best I had on a pizza. The tomato sauce wasn't too sweet or sour, it was the right cooked down tangy flavor. Also, the crust was not hard as a rock, instead was the right softness and hardness. We enjoyed every last bite..."
"I can see why this place has such a huge cult following. Great deep dish pizzas that have a slight char on the outside, descent priced drinks and a relaxing and chaotic atmosphere. The wait was like 45 minutes to get a table but luckily I was allowed to squeeze into the bar and skipped all the wait. Still, call ahead if you can or just don't come starving. It's worth the wait if you have to."
"I've been so excited to try this place for years.  I've been on the hunt for a similar go to for deep dish! We got here after a walking tour ended and were seated quickly!  The tables and chairs are old and my chair was even taped up.  It looks very aged. I'm so glad we got there early because when we left there was a 45 minute wait.We quickly knew what we wanted (Sausage and pepperoni pizza), and I ordered a beer and my husband ordered a diet drink. The pizza came out about 35 minutes later, which was what we anticipated.  I was very excited for the cheese pull when she served us our slices but there was barely one.  Note: next time I'll order extra cheese.  However, there were a lot of toppings and I still really loved this pizza it just wasn't like the videos I've seen before. One thing to note, when the bill came it ""suggested"" tips on the iPad; however, it was based on the subtotal plus tax rather than the sub-total... I have to say that was a bit shady to me, as sales tax is over 10% in Chicago and is not supposed to be included as part of tipping and I bet most customers don't even pay attention to this. There is an option to change your tip to a different percentage or dollar amount, but you have to notice what is happening.  I hope this gets changed. I'd like to give them another try when we visit the city again."
"Bam!  Quality Chicago style deep dish pizza!  Although I ordered it to go and had to wait 25 minutes until I got to my hotel, it was still delicious and the crust was crispy.  I got the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The ingredients were fresh and plentiful.  Careful what size you order as this pizza is satisfying and filling.  This is a must stop by place if you are in Chicago.  Don't miss the opportunity to have the best Chicago style deep dish in the country.  Even if you don't like deep dish, give this one a try.  You will be"
"I wish I could give a 5 for food and 2 for customer service....The hostess station was a HOT MESS when we got there around 7:30 pm on Saturday.  We expected to have a wait, but not a 2.5 hour one!  That just seems like poor management and overall time management!  It made it extremely frustrating to listen to the hostess tell guest after guest 2-2.5 hour wait when I was looking at 3 empty tables within sight of the entrance!  Lucky, we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar and order right from there.  The bartender was working like crazy to not only serve her guests by run the bar for the entire place.  It was quite disappointing to see 2 staff members standing on their phone the ENTIRE time we sat at the bar....how is there a 2.5 hour wait but not all hands on deck?The pizza was a great and we'd go back for more!  CAREFUL....don't over order.  The small was plenty for 2 people!"
"I have been wanting to come here for 4 YEARS. Don't be dumb like me and wait that long. My husband and I went in for dinner earlier in the week before a movie at Webster Place. Since it was  a weekday, there was no wait. But I know for sure there is usually a long wait for a  table at high traffic times. We ordered onion rings and a medium sausage pizza. I thought to myself, maybe the hype isn't real. OH IT REAL. The crust of the pizza is so good, it's worth it. For sure try this if you haven't already.  The onion rings we perfect, I like that it's served wit bbq sauce.  I can't wait to go back. The service is quick and the prices are fair."
"Pequod's.  Strange name, delicious pizza.I'm not certain why the whale on the menu is wearing thong underwear on its head, but I do know that the pizza is fantastic.The atmosphere is that of a college pizza/sports bar.  A majority of it's patrons seem to be college students.  I felt like an old geezer, and I'm only 40. This place is extremely busy, and the line was out the door...on a Sunday afternoon.  Thankfully our pizza tour was able to walk right in, as they were expecting us.  I felt bad for the people waiting outside in the sun!Their deep dish has a lighter, airy crust, but very thick.  When you add the cheese and sauce, you get a very unique type of pizza.Oh, and do yourself a favor - EAT ALL OF THE CRUST.  It looks burnt, but that's the best part -  ""carmelized crust.""  It's a layer of cheese that melts together with the crust.  A tiny piece of heaven right there!I probably won't ever be in this neighborhood again, but if I am, I'll definitely drop in!"
"Well worth the wait!  Even with the plethora of tables upstairs and downstairs, be prepared to wait awhile.  However, the service is excellent and the deep dish is in a class of its own.  The burnt cheese up the back of the crust just makes this the best place for Chicago pie, hands down."
"By far the best pizza in Chicago! A month ago I met a guy in an Uber we shared in San Diego and directed me to Pequod's staying this is where Chicagoans frequent and boy I'm glad I met him. This was the best pizza I've tried in my 4 visits to Chicago and will only eat pizza there from now on. Decor-it's an old brick building with two floors of dining and a bar on both floors. The walls have a mix of Chicago sports paraphanelia and Chicago history. Tight seating area upstairs and down, and a very small bar upstairs. Service-I sat at the bar, so really can't comment on service, but bar tender was decent and brought me what I asked. Food-Pizza is Phenomenal!!!! Perfectly seasoned with a blend of spices like oregano and garlic. The crust was crisped to perfection and topped with tons of cheese, sausage, and pepperoni's. Garlic cheese bread was also perfection! Simply put this place rocks and is amazing. Beware there are long lines, but that is testament of how good food is. Can't wait to go back!!!"
"I am a lover of thin crust!!!Having said that, never ever eat thin crust here..it's sad..and a pathetic excuse for pizza BUT...The deep dish here is SO yummy. I love the sausage here even though I usually avoid sausages (colon cancer and all, blah blah). Simply put, this place is an exception for me. I eat a deep dish pizza with sausage here!! Totes breaking away from my usual preferences. Try it yourself. You might surprise yourself too!"
"I visited the Morton Grove location 8 years ago and I absolutely loved it.  I still enjoyed the pizza at this newer Chicago location, but it didn't taste quite as amazing at the one I had at the Morton Grove location.  The crust seemed more burnt than the caramelized crust I remember.  Maybe it's because the Morton Grove location is the original, and the oven used has the special flavor from years of baking pizza. One tip if you plan to eat lunch on a weekday - call in your order.  Then text them when you are 15 minutes away.  They will reserve your seat and your pizza will come out in about 15-20 minutes after you are seated."
Ever since I've been to Burt's place in Skokie I've lovers pequods the place is bustling as busy sometimes a wait but worth it. I love sausage mushroom onion a little well done yum
"My sister used to live in Chicago, and being from NY, she was super excited to experience their pizza.  I don't remember the name of the place she took us to for deep dish, but none of us liked it --- the sauce, the crust, the cheese... none of it.  I want to say it was Giordano's, but I'm not 100% sure.Fast forward to now, I returned to Chicago for a festival and was willing to give pizza another chance.  I tried Lou Malnati's, and while I liked the sauce and cheese, I was not a fan of the crust at all.  But then after the festival I decided to seek this place out... and everything changed.  First of all, there was a mob outside of the restaurant waiting to be seated.  Since I was by myself, I was happy to squeeze through, go inside and find a seat at the bar.  As I passed by the hostess's podium, I saw a sign that said pizzas ordered at the time would take 60 minutes.  That's a nice thing to know, instead of being shocked as you wait for your food.Anyways, I found a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine as I waited for pizza.  I believe it did take about an hour, and when it came... it was pipin' hot in a pan.  The person who brought it to me cut me a slice and put it on a plate.  I had to wait for it to cool down before I could pick it up.  As a matter of fact, it was still a tad loose so I knifed & forked it.  I asked for pepperoni and green peppers, but I did not expect it to be huge chunks of peppers nor for there to be loads and loads of pepperoni.  That combined with their rather sweet sauce and perfectly caramelized and textured crust was....AWESOME!!!Chicago pizza has been redeemed for me and it's all thanks to Pequod's.   I would gladly come back.  Be warned: do NOT come with a big party.  I get the feeling you'd be waiting a long time if you did.  If you do though, just be prepared."
"A deep dish pizza unlike anything I've eaten before.Recommend by a couple of local Chicago friends, we decided to stop in. Upon entering, there's a written sign showing you the expected wait for your pizza. When we walked in it showed an estimated 40 minute wait. Our party was 5 & the server recommended a large pizza but to be honest a medium would've been sufficient.I can't compare their deep dish to any pizza, I've eaten before. It tasted more similar to a gourmet lasagna & it was excellent. The crust was the highlight and the toppings (pepperoni, sausage) were excellent as well. Overall it was very good but not great. A unique tasting pizza."
"I love Pequod's, and always recommend it to visitors looking for good deep dish. It's my second favorite deep dish in the city (after Art of Pizza), but hands down has my favorite crust. The caramelized cheese is delicious, and worth coming for on its own. I especially like the spinach pies here. As a note, you can call ahead for preferred seating. If you have a large group, they'll guarantee a table."
"Came by here looking for the unique deep dish. The place is mobbed with locals. Service was fast and attentive. The deep dish was tasty, love the way they do the crust here with crunch."
"Real Chicagoans know: this is the best Chicago pie there is. They've been using the same pans for like 100 years, so every pizza tells the story of pizzas past. The way the cheese caramelizes around the edges is just perfection, I don't know how else to describe it."
"After doing a search on Yelp for the best pizza in Chicago, we knew we had to give Pequod's a try. Staying downtown, the walk was too far, so we took a Lyft (which was a quick ride). We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. Upon entry, it seemed a bit crowded, so I was pleased when we were led upstairs to a much more open space. We were directed to a high-top table and our server quickly welcomed us. Now, this place is all about the pizza, so I will get to the point. It was interesting that the pie was not a traditional Chicago-style pizza, but a deep dish pizza, so the main difference was the crust. That fact threw me a bit at first, but the pizza was tremendously satisfying. The pepperoni was thick and spicy, the sauce flavorful, and the cheese perfectly melted and rich. We ordered a small. It had four pieces, but they were substantial, so between the two of us, we ate three and took one to go. Our server was super friendly and attentive (not too much attention, not too little attention, but the attention was just right). If you are visiting Chicago, I recommend venturing out of downtown proper to taste the deliciousness of Pequod's."
"4.5 stars. Yum! Tried Pequod's after it was recommended to us by a few people. Arrived at 11:15am on a Sunday morning and there were maybe 4 people in the place - wanted to be sure we got there early to get a seat. We had done the priority seating on their website the day before, but turns out we didn't need it. Since there was plenty of room, we decided to sit at the bar. We ordered a small pizza (this for my husband and I) with sausage, garlic onions, tomatoes, and extra cheese and sauce (as recommended by fellow Yelpers). I'm definitely glad we got the extra cheese - I'm not sure I'd get the extra sauce if I had to do it again (I'd also definitely forego the tomatoes, definitely unnecessary, especially with the extra sauce). The crust - ooooh, that crust. Just as good as everyone says. The roasted garlic was amazing, the cheese nice and gooey. Overall...it was like pizza lasagna - and I mean that very positively. Really delicious, and filling. The small was perfect for the two of us (we're from out of town, so no place to store leftovers). The bartender was honest and said it takes about 40 minutes per pizza, so we split a cesar salad...if I had to do it all over again I wouldn't have ordered that, I would have just waited. Why not 5 stars? It's a bit expensive (I mean, it's pizza...and I wish there'd been a few more pieces of sausage). And there weren't very many beers on tap. I know their focus is pizza, but a few more beers (and local beers) would have been nice to see."
The best pizza ever in a relaxed atmosphere...functional wait service...relaxed ambiance
Only the long wait for a table keeps a fifth star from appearing in this review.  We were in town for a wedding and wanted to sample what Chicago calls pizza.  We were directed fortunately to Pequod's and were not disappointed.  To cut our wait time we ate at the bar.  Our bar tender was very helpful as we discussed our ordering options.  It's a fun environment and the pizza was delicious.
"After a full day of being at the United Center for my first time in Chicago, and obstinately not eating much, I obviously had to get myself some deep dish pizza. Pequod's was highly recommended to me, and I got there past midnight on a Friday night.Since I was there at a relatively odd hour, getting a spot was a breeze. The ambience is similar neighborhood friendly dive bar but with the aroma of pizzas instead of beer. To my dismay though, the only pizzas served here were pan pizzas - the horror!On clarifying with the waitress though, it seems like the main difference between a deep dish and their pan pizzas is the fact that Pequod's makes them in a skillet, resulting in their (famous) blackened edges. I ended up going with a simple if slightly oddball combo of olives and jalepenos.It had all the hallmarks of a deep dish pizza: 40min to make; a fork and knife needed to eat it and being absolutely stuffed after about 2 slices. It was absolutely delicious! The ingredients tasted so fresh, and the balance of cheese:toppings:crust seemed perfect; with nothing overwhelming the pizza. I love my Brooklyn style pizza, but Pequod's is right up there with the best I've ever had and I can't wait for another trip to Chicago to have it!"
"I've been to Chicago twice. Over the course of those two trips, I have had Lou Malnati's, Giodarno's, and Pequod's on this most recent trip. I will rank them accordingly: 1) Giodarno's2) Pequod's3) Malnati's On to Pequod's deep dish. We walked in right when it opened, so there wasn't a wait and got seated fairly quickly. We ordered and customized toppings (peppers, onions, and sausage). Pequod's is well known for their caramelized crust so I was very excited to try that. When the pizza, came it smelled delicious and looked so good. Flavors were very good, but I honestly was not a fan of the caramelized crust on some parts. It was kind of burned, so it added this unpleasant taste when eating it. We also ordered fried mushrooms as apps, also good, but could skip especially if you get deep dish. Worth checking out if you're in the area, but it's kinda tough because it's not super convenient to get to."
"So before my trip to Chicago I was doing A LOT of research. I've been to the Chi a lot now. But I never really cared about who was the best deep dish in town. I was only interested in experiencing it and the Chi Town lifestyle, if you know what I mean. So this time I wanted to know who had the best in town. During my research this place kept on popping up. I've already tried a lot of the other top rated places so wanted to go here. Food Network also rated it the second best pizza in the Nation! So I had to give it a try.When I went I ordered a large pep and sausage pan (deep dish) w/ extra cheese. It came out in the normal deep dish cast iron pan. And you could tell just by looking at it what time of experience I was in for. It looked so good. When I finally started eating it I fell in love. No joke, it's that good. All the flavors go so well together. The sauce was perfect and everything came together. I love the darkened caramelized cheese ring around the edges. You won't really get that anywhere else and it's kind of a Peqouds ""thing"". This was my first deep dish with thick crust. But it was so good. It was cooked perfect. The pizza was steaming hot and I still couldn't even let it sit a second before taking more bites. I will say this I by far my favorite Deep Dish. Giordano's what? Lou Malnati's who?... never heard of em..... This is my go to spot in my favorite city now. No game or gimmicks, you gotta go if you never been. This pizza is LIT.The place is very small. And I heard that it normally has lines around the corner. So I made sure to get here early before opening to get a spot. I'd suggest that for anyone that comes from out of town. The inside looks like a plain regular bar or pub. Which makes it even better. They don't have that corporate feel that the other places have. Their menu is basic, like super basic. And that just adds to the whole ambiance of this place. No flashing likes and smoke and mirrors. They are about their pizza, and that's what on show here.The service was nice. Nothing too great. Just average. But that's fine. As long as it is not negative. Everything was on time and quick. We had our drinks refilled when we needed them and everything. Overall this place has set the standard for Chicago deep dish for me. I was giving other pizza places high ratings. But not I gotta re think the whole thing. This place is a 10/10 and everything else falls under it. That's just #Facts. This is definitely my new go to when in the Windy City. I'd recommend this to anybody that. Tourist or not.  Wish I could give it 6 stars honestly."
"Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Crust was buttery, sauce was perfect and the cheese was piled high. The wait time to get seated was not bad at all. The cooking time for the pizza was about 1 hour if not longer which is why I'm not giving them 5 stars. They need to figure out a better system to get the food out quicker. An hour is just way too long."
"This was our first stop on an incredible Pizza Tour of Chicago that we took on a work trip recently. I have seriously been dreaming about this pizza ever since.The place feels kind of divey, but they are doing some transcendental magic in the kitchen. Our tour guide explained that they add mozzarella in the cast iron pan to help create their incredible caramelized, crunchy, unforgettable crust. I am such a sucker for burnty cheese, and their toppings are as incredibly well-made as their signature crest. Be sure to order the Italian sausage.I really intended to save more room for the last stop, a deep dish spot that I expected to like the best, but Pequod's was truly the stand out of the tour. After finishing my own piece, I scavenged off of some of my coworkers plates who hadn't had room to finish their whole piece. Even our gluten-free gal was picking the cheesy edge off of other people's pieces so that she could participate vicariously in this incredible pizza.I so highly recommend this spot and guarantee I'll be back again and again!"
"If you can't decide where to get deep dish pizza in Chicago, give this place a try. It's not the Chicago deep dish I remember having as a kid, but it's pretty damn good. The crust is thick and a little bread-y, the toppings are fresh and not over cooked. I got a small to share with one person and it was just the right amount of food. It takes about 40 minutes for them to cook the pizza but we seemed to have only waited 20. If you're driving, there's plenty of street parking nearby. I got here around 12:30pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. Although I do have to dock some points for the state of the table. Which had to be propped up so our pizza didn't meet an untimely demise. Great place to catch a game too, there's plenty of TVs for you to catch your favourite sports teams."
"Tourist alert:  Do not eat here!  Go to UNO's or Geno's East.  Please!!  That way we won't have to wait as long for a table and this fantastic pizza when we go back (and back).  Friendly staff kept our drinks filled while we snacked on cheese sticks (just OK) waiting the announced 55 min wait for the pies. They came a bit early and we loved them!  Especially the deep dish.  We found the thin crust to be a bit thick for our liking, but learning for next time.  Generous amounts of toppings!"
"We were sitting quietly in a booth on the second story of Pequod's near midnight. Princess Carewee was to my left, configuring her camera after a full day of adventure. Across from us is our mercurial friend, Kent24, fully wrapped in Giants attire. We were quiet. Battered from a long day of eating, drinking, baseball, and more eating, we had to travel by foot to this popular Pizza place. There was little energy left for idle conversations.By contrast, the restaurant was loud and lively, even at this late hour. The walls were illuminated with neon lights of commercial beer logos and Chicago sports team. Against the dim lighting, the décor reminds one more of a sports bar than a pizzeria. But maybe the two are the same here in the Midwest. The menu was a single laminated piece of literature. It dutifully reminded us that Pequod was famous for its caramelized crust, or its ""darkened edge"". Between the three of us, we had no idea how this would taste, but were in firm agreement that it must be awesome. The menu also listed out all the toppings that we can choose from. The usual suspects were all present: Spinach, Sausage, Mushroom, Extra Ch---""Extra Cheese."" I broke our silence with a wide-eyed whisper. Kent24 was not having it. Still feeling the effects of our hearty dinner not so many hours ago, the proposition of adding another layer of fat to an already heavy fourth-meal must have sounded ludicrous. But the thing you have to know about Kent24 is that it's never a 'hard no.' As a matter of fact, the 'No' is merely an invitation to strengthen the proposal of your idea - to describe the insanity, to explain the improbability, and to illustrate the grandeur of its effects. Kent24's 'No' is merely the demand that you verbalize the ""Lit-Ness"" that is your idea and immortalize the awesomeness in words.""Fine, get the extra cheese."" Kent24 conceded, inevitably I may add.Thus, I would not be doing our gluttonous gluttony justice if I do not chronicle our pizza experience to you as I have imagined it to Kent24 just moments before our glory.The server arrived at our table with a circular pan. Sitting within the pan were the dear and familiar colors of a midnight pizza. The crimson red of the classic pepperoni and the radiant green of the bell peppers clashed violently against a wobbly backdrop of golden mozzarella. Fiery red tomato sauces burst through pockets of the melted surface and splattered on any and all nearby darkened sausages and olives. All the colors glistened under a thin layer of oil, accentuating this visual spectacle. Enclosed within the pan was chaos and beauty, and it was announcing its presence ever so loudly with its violent aroma. My heart began racing. I knew Kent24's was too. After juggling our phones with our trembling hands, we had the cameras in position to capture this moment. Finally, a LITsperience worthy to share on our social media outlets, guaranteed to extract those coveted little hearts from our followers.The server, standing by us this whole time, motioned politely for us to wait. He wore a slight smirk on his face and his brown eyes exude the type of confidence that we had only seen in a meme... he did not speak, but we heard him loud and clear.""This isn't even my final form.""The metal slicer clanged against the pan and in one swift motion, raised a slice of the pie into the night sky. The sight was majestic --- no, it was divine. In its ascent, small pieces of sausages separated from its body and fell gloriously from the skies. The streams of mozzarella stretched with the crust and into the gates of heaven. Each golden strand looked as if it were a celestial ray of light breaking through the clouds and onto Earth, blessing the taste buds of devout eaters.  In truth, neither Kent24 nor I finished more than one slice of that pizza. As its appearance suggests, it was as heavy as it was filling. We were punished for our greed and gluttony as we had no microwave in our lodgings and had to watch more than half of our deep dish go to waste. But it was worth it. Pequod's Deep Dish was the most amazing piece of pizza I have ever witnessed and I will sin a hundred times to eat that forbidden pie again. We left Pequod's with our bellies full of pizza and a night full of memories. The decision to go with extra cheese - against the better judgment of our appetite, diet, and/or health - was the right decision. Years from now, Kent24 and I will be throwing back some Coors Light (Kent went to Colorado ONCE) and we will remember this night in Chicago. We will reminisce about Wrigley, we will laugh about the LC, and we will talk about how we once saw a slice of deep dish pizza soared into the cosmos. LITness is forever.SIDE STORYAs many of you may know, Princess Carewee is a plant based homie. Pequod was able to accommodate her with a no-cheese deep dish. The crust was egg-free - we asked. It looked earthly compared to our pie, but she loved it. So yeah, vegan friendly!"
Best deep dish in Chicago. Also the veggie pizza have jalapenos that aren't pickled - can get super hot.
"Look, we Chicagoans know we have some of the best pizza in the world, right here in our city. But those darned tourists always go to the places advertised in airplane magazines or thise crap places found in search engines. You can be an idiot,  or have the best pizza in Chicago.  Piquads is and should be thought of as top 5! This order as you like it place is all about fresh real ingredients. So your pizza is authentic great tasting food. Their sausage cannot be rivaled. The crust is authentic Italian and has a flavor that enhances the sauces.  There is no best ingredients to their pizzas. I thing veggie pizza is usually a waste but their spices and veggies rule."
"It's quite a common thing for a business to, in one fashion or another, claim to be the best. Best in the city, best in the world, best in show; the claim has all but lost its meaning- with one exception: the customers. You can read reviews, take into consideration the opinions of critics, etc. But when you get down what really counts and matters, it's the opinion of the paying customer that matters. And when you hear ""best"" being used to describe a place over and over by multiple customers, it's best to pay attention.For weeks before visiting Chicago, we had been told by ex-pats and friends alike, that the place to get the best pan pizza in all of Chicago, was Pequad's.And you know what? It really is.Without exaggeration or embellishment, Pequod's is the gold standard of deep dish pizza in all of Chicago (maybe the whole world, for that matter). The crust is thick, crisp, and not doughy or undercooked. The cheese edge is perfectly caramelized, without being burnt. The toppings are thick and  plenty, no matter how many or few you choose. On average, one person can usually eat one, or two slices. So come as a group, or plan on bringing home leftovers (re-heat in a pan or iron skillet, if you do).Now, there are a couple of downsides, that everyone should be aware of, before going in. For starters, on busy days/nights (especially in game nights), and seating is first come-first served, with a long waiting time (don't worry- it's worth it). So, if you can, request a table at least twenty four hours in advance.The other thing to keep in mind, is when it's slammed, your order may be a bit heavy on the sauce. So, when ordering, be sure to ask to go easy on the marinara. Make no mistake about it, Pequad's stands alone. They're incomparable to any other place. They are well worth going out of your way for. I can not recommend them enough. What they serve does not just feed the body, but the soul. But don't take my word for it, try them yourself. You can thank me later."
"When in Chicago, we had to try deep dish.  After reading reviews on Yelp and other websites and talking with a few people - we decided to try deep dish here for spot that we served a less touristy deep dish than you'd get near the Loop. The place is sort off the beaten path and the L train and is an old school dive bar with dark lightening so wasn't sure what to expect. We were seated right away and saw the sign to expect a 40 minute wait for pizza but it was sort of an odd time (5pm on a Monday) as we were expecting a much longer wait. We ordered some beers and mozzarella sticks and settled in to await the pizza. Not a ton of other options besides pizza and bar food FYI. Yes, it met the hype! The crust was doughy with a nice sweet tomato sauce and not a ton of cheese, it was thick and delicious especially the caramelized crust. I was stuffed after eating my first slice of small pizza but had to eat the second slice.  With so many reviews, I guess the secret is out where to grab food Chicago deep dish!"
You know what's amazing going to a place that doesn't change a damn thing and is still a hit. From living in Chicago 22 years then moving to the burbs to start a family I just had to bring them here. Granted we brought our 10 month old (he's loud but not bitchy) here last night great idea because there was seating up stairs which is the best spot. Nice relaxing still has TVs. Pizza is amazing the sauce is the best in the city the crust and dough is complex yet fluffy. If you crave pizza with a layer of toppings stop by grab a pitcher and relax.
Amazing deep dish. My Chicago friend took me here as they say it's better than the normal touristy deep dish places. So worth the long wait and I can't wait to come back again.
This was my first place I've ever had Chicago style deep dish pizza and it was amazing. I would recommend everyone to come and try this place. It's custom made so you can add whatever you want but just know it does take about atleast 45min for any style of pizza. The service here was great everyone was very friendly. Definitely will be back when I'm in town.
I came here during lunch time in the middle of the week and  the restaurant had a decent amount of people inside. Our server was quick to take drink orders and make ask if we had any questions about the menu. I ended up getting the lunch special which is a personal cheese pizza and a drink for 5 bucks. This is an amazing deal for quality pizza. They said it could take 45 minutes for the pizza to cook but it only ended up being like 25-30 minutes. The pizza itself has nice and crispy crust with a good sauce and plenty of cheese. I had heard a lot about Pequod's and I wasn't disappointed. Next time I'm back in town I would definitely come back and try some of their other pizzas.
"Since moving to the Windy City I been looking for the deep dish of all deep dishes. We got here and had giordarnos pizza. It was alright but nothing to write home about. Next we tried Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. That hit the spot but I felt like it there was something else out there for me to try. After searching high and low, I saw other yelp reviews that Pequod's was the spot to go. After exploring downtown we decided to dabble in this pizza. Boy oh boy I'm so glad we did! The pizza was fire! But the crust stole the show! That crispy burnt cheese was it for me! We ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza with garlic. Parking sucks around the area and there will be a wait, especially after a Cubs game. I won't dock them a star for that. Too bad I live far as hell to eat this pizza because if I lived close, I would eat this every day! I will be back if I'm in the area!"
"If you're looking for authentic deep dish pizza, look no further! Got a tip from a local to skip Lou's and Giordano's and get pizza from Pequod's! Indeed they were right. Out of curiosity we tried Lou's and it was awful, I would not recommended it to anyone. Pequod's was the real deal! We got a medium pan pizza with cheese with extra sauce and at first bite, we knew that we were in Chicago! Buttery crust, just the right amount of cheese, and flavorful, homemade sauce.We were staying on N. Michigan Avenue and we realized Pequod's was about 4 miles away so we called and they said they delivered to where we were staying. The girl on the phone was extremely helpful. She told us to order 1 hr and 20 minutes in advance to take into account the cook and delivery time. When the pizza arrived, it was still hot! For a small delivery fee, this was such a better option than taking an Uber there and back."
"Everyone has told me that Pequod's does a great deep dish pizza. When I mentioned I was going to Chicago, Chicagoans unanimously said I had to stop by Pequod's. I'm definitely glad I went, and I had a good time, but I guess deep dish just isn't my thing. Here goes the review:We stopped by Pequod's in the late afternoon on a Friday. We were prepared to wait, but got lucky and were seated right away. We were informed that the wait for pizza would be ~45 minutes; I think it ended up being a little less. We went for the medium deep dish with spinach and sausages. The pizza is so bread-y (in the words of my friend, it felt like ""90% bread"") that though the pizza didn't look large, it was massively filling. The fillings were generous (so much cheese, so much sauce, basically an entire layer of spinach and copious amounts of sausage) and very liquid-y, but the crust held up well to all that moisture. That being said, it was a fork-and-knife pizza experience.Our favorite part of the pizza was the sausage, which had a prominent fennel flavor and a juicy bite. The cheese had that good stretchy pull, but was on the bland side, and we needed a good sprinkle of red pepper flakes to add some flavor. And I know that deep dishes are about that thick crust, but there was so. much. bread.Service was about what you'd expect for a busy, pub-style sort of place - they took our order in a timely manner, but it was difficult to flag down staff for water refills and red pepper flakes (which should be available at all tables). Prices were fair; we each paid ~$11, including tip. I'm glad we stopped by and experienced deep dish, and I can appreciate that there's something comforting about a pan filled with bread, tomato sauce, assorted toppings, and melted cheese. But ultimately, Pequod's didn't win me over, and as far as deep dish goes, I don't have any burning desire to eat it again any time soon."
"Visited this place for lunch around 3pm on a Saturday. Although the sign showed that their was a 45 min wait for the pizza, ours arrived in 25 min which was nice.We ordered house salad which was totally average. Only ordered it to get some nutrients. We shared a personal pan pizza (which is the smallest size) given we had a heavy breakfast. Our toppings included onions, garlic, mushrooms and black olives. Overall the pizza was good and very filling. But thought it wasn't the best pizza we had in Chicago.Overall worth trying if the waiting time is less than 45 min."
"2 yrs is not enough to get to know all the deliciousness Chicago has to offer unless you're lucky enough to have experienced company around you. That is basically how I came across Pequod's. I'm personally not a crazy, salivating at the thought of a deep dish fan and have only had my occasional Giordanos or Lou's. So, when I was told how awesome this joint is I was honestly not expecting a lot. However, when I got to try their risky, on the edge, slightly burnt buttery crust topped with the amazing lava of sauce and veggies- It was quite a surprise. We had ordered on phone before heading to Pequod's so the service was fairly quick. Once seated, the ambience was very casual, like a neighborhood bar- food joint.  Servers were sweet, guided us well and refilled our drinks on time. I've heard this place gets crazy packed on weekends and rush hours so call beforehand. We got lucky with the parking but it's usually on a busy street. Overall very pleased, will return and will recommend to all my tourist friends in search of that good ol' deep dish."
"Personally, the best pizza in Chicago. Not, perhaps a ""real"" deep dish... but in a pan, with caramelized, delicious crusts, nice layer of cheese (if you're expecting a lot of cheese like on other deep dish pizzas filled half with tomato sauce and half with cheese, you should ask for an extra topping of cheese) and filled with fresh, yummy ingredients. While searching for deep dish, I've been to the famed Lou Malnati's  and Giordanos but was never wowed. I thought it was just that I don't really like deep dish. It is too big, too soggy, too salty and too tomatoyee. Well, wether Pequod's is real deep dish or its fixed version, this is one pizza I like! It's definitely not NY style thin or Costco pizza (which I like, btw, but I wouldn't say they are better than Pequod's as some reviewer mentioned... at least personally, this here is definitely worth it), and also crusty and filled with yummy ingredients. I like that the tomato sauce is not overpowering. On this last visit, I thought they had skimped out on cheese though. The last several times I've been, the cheese was oozing out while the server was serving up the pizza, but this time, it definitely stayed in place, and I could taste it less. I hope it was just a temporary hiccup rather than a permanent cost saving tactic. Their $4.95 lunch specials come with a personal size pizza and a drink. Some years ago, it was with a beer but that's changed to a fountain drink. I really like this personal size... Feels like more caramelized deliciousness. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and garlic, and they definitely loaded it up. We also shared the app combo. Glad we did, since we were hungry and the pizza takes 40 minutes to cook. Yes, either order ahead (I'm not sure you can, actually, but I should next time I go), or be ready to wait. The appetizer combo came with 4 pieces of each item so the 4 of us in our party didn't have to fight over anything. So sorry Lou, sorry Giordano... Pequod's is where I go!"
"Love their deep dish here! Also love their personal sized pizza lunch special. I've tried one other deep dish pizza in Chicago, and I must say I love Pequod's much more.The pizza will take a little while to bake, but the crunchy crust and crisp cheese edge is worth it! Also not too bready and packed with flavor."
I love Pequod's! Some of the best deep dish pizza in the city. I think the crust is perfect. I like the deep dish with mushrooms and spinach. I also have had the pesto pasta and the pequods salad which is so good. It is totally worth the wait! But if you do not want to wait then I would recommend going at an off time. Definitely a great place to take out of town guests or people that really love pizza!!!
Super crunchy crust Better to add giardiniera for a little spice. :) The wait is about 30 mins. But worth it.
"The reviews don't lie. The pizza is fantastic. The crust is crispy, charred in some places, thick and substantial. Toppings are generous and large size - meaning when we ordered green peppers, they were thick slices. When we ordered Italian sausage, it was big flavorful pieces. Wait time is what it is. Pequod's is simply too popular to keep the crowds away. Call in your order ahead of time and when you arrive and are seated, then the original 40 minute cooking time will be reduced to 20 minutes. Appetizers are small in my opinion. We had the zucchini slices and it was barely enough for 4 people. Everyone has a favorite pizza joint. This is mine. And I've come from out of town twice to eat here because it's THAT good. If you're a major cheese lover, Pequod's won't be for you because their specialty is the crust. They don't drown their pizzas in cheese."
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, on par with Giordano's in my opinion.  The front of the building is small, and upon stepping inside I thought the space was tiny.  But there is a second floor and it telescopes back, plenty of room, but show up earlier than later to have a shorter wait time.The pan pizza will take ~45 min to cook, so start with some drinks and appetizers.  The garlic bread and marinara sauce was large, but not especially flavorful, get it if you want but also try other things on the menu.  The pizza itself is why everyone comes to Pequod's and it meets the hype.  The crust on the pan pizza is caramelized in a way that Lou's tries, but Pequod's expertly accomplishes.  The crust adds an extra dimension to the pizza that Lou's or Giordano's cannot match.  The crust is thicker at Pequod's than other places, but the topping to crust ratio is appropriate. The ingredients on the pizza are also top notch, the sausage was flavorful and the basil aromatic after cooking.  The waiters do serve the pizza for you, and do so aggressively so I didn't get a photo of the whole pizza."
Pequod's is hands down my favorite deep dish pizza. I would not recommend the thin crust. I love the burnt cheese on the edges. I get extra cheese because I'm a cheese lover and they don't use as much as I'm accustomed to on a deep dish pizza.
"We came to Pequod's after I ran the Wisconsin marathon, and it was probably the best decision we could've made. We got a medium pizza with sausage and pepperoni-- the sausage chunks were huge and they loaded the pizza with pepperoni slices. I ate half and my boyfriend ate the other half, and we were stuffed. Everything about this pizza was perfect! I also loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. It seemed like the perfect college town pizza place. Tons of seating also, we were expecting to have to wait when we first entered but we very quickly got seated on the second floor. Good selection of beer on draft, small selection of wine; we asked about a cocktail menu but they only have the basic liquors and no menu. Not a problem to me, beer goes perfectly with beer!"
"I took your advice.  I took all of your advice on my first trip to Chicago, and I'm so glad I did.  I only had the time (and the desire, tbh) for one deep dish pizza while in the city, and I went with Pequod's.  And it was absolutely phenomenal.  The personal pizza with pepperoni added is the way to go, do not second guess yourself.  And the staff was so friendly!  I took a Lyft straight from the airport here, and they didn't make me feel silly at all when I rolled my suitcase through the door like the goofy tourist I was.  Best pizza, best pizza joint."
I used to come here way back in the day. It's typical Chicago style deep dish and it's delicious. I'm a big Lou Malnatis fan but this comes pretty close.
"Super dive bar-y style pizza joint. With both an upstairs and a downstairs, it was much larger than I anticipated, and insanely crowded. I appreciated that they did an amazing job helping us to party plan. Everything from taking our 20 person reservation to discussing bill breakdown to pre-ordering was above and beyond. Our service was attentive throughout and everything came out quickly and promptly (trust me when I say order ahead, or you'll be hangry waiting 60 minutes for your pizza!). Personal pizza preference for me is the thinner the crust, the better, and their thin crust did not disappoint! Don't fret if you're not a fan of deep dish because this is a great option. Their pan style pizza crust was also delicious; ""burnt"" and crispy, which is just my style. So happy I finally got to experience this Chicago classic! :)"
"Pequod's!!! WTF have I been doing as a Chicagoan that it took me this long to try you?! I'm not going to lie, I've always been a Lou's loyalist when it comes to Chi Pizza - but y'all are giving them a serious run for their money. First things first, I get this isn't deep dish in our traditional sense, but it dang sure ain't thin crust. It is its own style 'Pan Pizza' as they call it, with a lot of crust and less cheese to it.I think I always overlooked Pequod's since it's a bit more humble in it's building (a two story spot in Lincoln Park with another location in Morton Grove) and also not having a million locations like some of the other pizza chains. Let me advise everyone else, don't follow in my footsteps! Do ~not~ sleep on Pequod's!I tried the Sausage Pizza last night and as mentioned, it has a crispy crust thicker than you're used to while still a bit airy, less cheese, less sauce and a decent amount of sausage on top. It was everything I dreamed it could be - tasty from the first bite to the last. I am a weak sauce and could only shovel one piece down the hatch (and I even struggled with the one piece) but others in my group had 2, even 3 pieces so YMMV. If you go to their actual location, you'll get the pie piping hot & fresh from the oven! But don't front, you may just want to take it to go to eat in shame alone while Netflixing and there's nothing wrong with that. Just be sure to dig in as soon as you can to get all the warm goodness you deserve.I saw online they do a 'Chicago Lunch Special' - $4.95 for a 7"" pan cheese pizza with a drink, Monday-Friday 11am-3pm for dine in orders. Yep, I'll be back for that."
"Best Chicago deep dish pizza I've had, I think I see where some of the criticisms come into play, particularly involving the sauce/dough ratio, but there's something just good about having that doughyness. The best part is definitely the charred cheesy crust, its really to die for. If you come at the right time the wait could actually be zero, aka a Thursday afternoon. Overall loved my experience there"
"The best deep dish in Chicago, and I've had them all. As a stuck up former New Yorker, I take my pizza seriously. Pequod's delivers with that unique carmelized crust, and a lightness to their pies that others lack. Cool vibe, but be prepared to wait."
Pequods pizza does deep dish well. They have this 4.95 deal on the weekdays for the regular cheese pizza. You can add toppings at the price of 80cents each. Totally worth it to try it on the weekdays. I heard that on the weekend the wait can go over 3 hrs. So be prepared to wait. We got seated right away during lunch and pizza takes around 40 minutes to make. So do get some appetizers and their CHILI. Omg so gooooood. Deep dish pizza is doughy... and I can't really finish it but I can say I tried it! From LA to Chicago.
"I've lived in Chicago (suburbs) most of my life, and prior to this I lived in Connecticut... I know the pizza game. First and foremost you HAVE to understand deep dish and ny-style are fundamentally different foods. Think of it like comparing vodka to beer... Sure they're both alcohol but everybody has a PREFERENCE.That said, wherever you sit on the Lou's/Gio's debate, I feel comfortable and confident saying this place is the best in all of Chicago. The carmelized crust brings this pizza to the next level. If you're from out of town and want to do things ""the Chicago way"" I reccomend getting your pizza with green peppers, mushrooms and sausage. In terms of portion sizes, normal eaters can usually eat 1-1.5 slices of the 12"", and big eaters maybe 2-3, absolutely no more.The place is pretty big (upstairs / downstairs) but I'd reccomend budgeting about 2.5 hours all said-and-done if you come on a Friday night or Saturday night. Wait times can  exceed an hour, then it takes about 45-60 minutes to get your pizza after getting seated. I went once on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated right away. I believe you can also phone in advance to get ""priority seating"" (not a reservation) which is probably worthwhile if you're going at a peak time.I reccomend ordering as soon as you sit down. While you wait, you can order drinks (they're pretty inexpensive) or apps. The apps are very average- avoid the bread but the mozz sticks were solid. The service definitely isn't stellar here, but the pizza MORE than makes up for it, as do the very low prices, realative to the big dd chains. You could easily come out with a tab under $50 for 4 people.This is unequivocally the best dd spot in all of Chicago and I always have (and will continue) to bring all of my nyc / west coast friends here when they visit."
"My first time here: 2 large pizzas was just perfect for 8 of us (I was a bit stuffed though). We were lucky to be able to grab a reservation since there was a large group of us. Pizza was good, they didn't skimp on toppings at all. Service was good as well. Ended up being $16pp which is very reasonable since everyone had a drink. Only complaint is that it's pretty crampy (one could say cozy) and loud, and I wasn't a fan of the restrooms."
Amazing pizza! Best I've ever had! Thanks to my uber driver David for the recommendation!
"Pequod's is one of my husband's favorite places for pizza. Unfortunately, its a little further away from our house so its a special trip every time we go here. The pizza is no doubt really good whether it'd be deep dish or pan pizza. I am not personally a fan of their pasta but I do like their pan pizza. We've been here for dinner with our friends and on birthdays and certainly turned out to be great. I would recommend this place to anyone whether a visitor (we've done this plenty of times) or chicagoan (if they haven't already been here)."
"This ranks in my top 3 list for thin crust Pizza.  Great crust, sauce, sausage, pepperoni, mushroom & onion absolutely fantastic!"
"First visit on a Friday night and this place is packed!  A friend arrived around 6:30 to put our names in, we were seated an hour later, with pizza(s)* arriving a bit less than an hour after that.  Issue with a super burnt crust first pizza (which I'm told is rare as others in my group have been multiple times attest), but service was quick and accommodating for our surprise +2 guests and high chair, and discounted our total bill for the problem.*Second pizza was delayed as they messed up the order, so was brought out later.  We crunched through the first burnt pizza (we think they left it on too long to wait for the second originally and that caused the burntness).And of course - the main thing to review: the pizza is amazing and totally worth the raves. The second was done to perfection, and even the first burnt one was delicious when creating the top off the crust bottom.  My friends were disappointed, but I don't care much for the bread anyways ao or was not a big deal to me. In any case, the way Pequad's does toppings is excellent. Overall:  Service 5Atmosphere 4.5Food 4.5Highly recommend ordering carry out, since the wait takes a while (2 hours before food, unless you order appetizer) and the place can be a bit claustrophobic for some with the crowds."
"In any other city, Pequod's would likely be standout 'pan' (i.e. deep dish) pizza.. But in Chicago, it unfortunately falls to the middle of the pack:1) Lou Malnati's 2) Pizzeria Uno 3) PEQUOD's4) Gino's East5) Giordano'sThe toppings were plentiful and the sauce was well balanced - nothing ruins a good slice of deep dish like drowning it in tomato sauce. The caramelized crust is an especially nice touch.The one major downfall of Pequod's is their crust-to-cheese ratio.. Although the crust is light and airy - and significantly better tasting than most crust-heavy options - each slice is mostly dough with a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Double the cheese, half the crust.. & you have a winning combination.Pequod's is worth the visit, but be prepared to wait.. Getting a table at peak times can take an hour or more, and ordering a pan will set you back another 45 min. Get there early.. Take your time. Enjoy a slice.. Or simply order ahead for instant gratification."
I have spent a lot A LOT of time in Chicago. I took a recommendation from people who live locally and Pequod's is BY FAR the best Chicago deep dish. Anyone who tells you different hasn't branched our or they are a tourist. The pizza came out at a great pace and we started off with beers and some side salads. The service was prompt and attentive. Love it. I'll keep coming here for sure and I highly recommend you check it out. The pizza is very filling. The picture is of a small. For two people we had half left and were very full. Pro tip: coming in during off hours so you don't have to wait. The wait can be incredibly long during dinner hours!
"Pequod's is my hand's down choice for best pizza in Chicago. I have nothing new to say that 2000 other reviewers haven't. This is the type of place that causes traffic jams from all the people trying to dine in and take-out and blocking the lane next to the traffic light. Pequods is deceptively large, with two expansive floors and hundreds of tables, yet the wait is never less than 30 minutes. It's that good.Anyone who tells you they didn't love Pequods, ask them if they had it at the restaurant or as take out. The take out is good, but this pizza was MEANT to be eaten fresh out of the oven and it is world's better when eaten as dine-in. The crunchy chewy bite of the burnt cheese crust adds such a depth of flavor to each slice. Save Lou Malnattis, Gino's, Giordannos for the tourists, eat like a local and get Pequods.Pro-tip: Grab a beer at their sister bar next door while you wait, and check out the fried zucchini flowers appetizer."
"Still the reigning champ. Came back here and got a small, half cheese / half pepperoni, which was perfect for two people. (Two slices each, which left me full, but not disgusting.)Absolutely the best deep dish I've ever had, and a staple of my Chicago trips."
"Now on to the Pizza BEST eats spots.  We tried three spots on our trip.Pequod's takes the pie, hahaha!  Pizza is so so delicious, you never want to stop eating.Awesome place, with upstairs seating in addition to the main seating, always busy.  Both visits we were able to grab seats at the bar and avoid the wait lines.Ordered the small pizza on the first visit, plenty for two, and the personal on day 2, a second lunch...we were crazy, but that is how good this place.Go and judge for yourself!"
"Pequod's isn't exactly the deep dish one would expect, but it definitely has a following that's greater than any traditional deep-dish spot. A deep doughy pizza with baked cheese on the outside, making the crust look burnt. However, the crunch really sets it apart from many competitors. Pure Perfection!"
"I've lived in Chicago for about 4 years now and never been a huge fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza. But my experience at Pequod's makes me now think that I'm just not a fan of Giordano's and Malnati's, not Chicago pizza as a whole, because Pequod's was and is THE PIZZA OF MY LIFE. It's also a huge plus they're open late!"
"I love my trips to Chicago mostly for the pizza.  A colleague insisted we go to Pequod's as it was supposed to be better than Lou's.  Perhaps ""better"" is dependent on individual taste.    I ordered a caesar with anchovies and was not disappointment except for the small portion of dressing.    We split a small pizza with sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms.   The crust, cheese and sauce were as good as advertised but the sausage and bell peppers were overpowering and left me slightly disappointed.   I enjoyed the sausage by itself, as most of it falls off anyway.  And maybe I'm just not a fresh bell pepper lover.  If you go to Chicago, it is worth a stop but you might start with something like just cheese and pepperoni."
"This off the beaten path deep dish pizza place came highly recommended. I was told to stay away from the chain deep dish and try this one. It is a little place near Lincoln Park. It is known for long waits and great pizza. We arrived early At about 4:30 PM expecting a long wait and we were seated immediately. We got their house special salad and put in our order for a large deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and onion. The salad was very good and when the pizza came I was amazed. It was not too greasy but it did have a lot of sauce. I thought it was some of the best deep dish I had ever tried and was very glad I did not go to one of the chains. The place does not have a lot of personality but it is all business when it comes to their pizza.  Service was good and prices were very reasonable it was 1875 for large pie and three dollars for each additional item."
"This review could be a little biased since I haven't had Chicago pizza up until this point. I moved from Cleveland this week and picked the place with the highest number of reviews above 3 1/2 stars. Let me tell you, this pizza is a different experience. Sorry in advance for this next comment Chicago, but this is my outside view of what I thought your pizza would be like.... I thought Chicago pizza would be a giant bread bowl with tomato soup. Haha  It's DEFINITELY not! This was a first time pizza experience and it was unlike anything I've had before. The crust is what makes it so good. It looks burnt, but it's not it's caramelized stick to your ribs crust. If you're looking for the ultimate comfort food look no further."
"Finally, I've been here a second time. And I don't know what it is, but I'm not head over heels about this place like some people are.Don't get me wrong, I've got a lot of respect for the caramelized crust, which is a nice little take on deep dish (which, to be honest, can only be modified so much). But I still like Lou Malnati's crust more.Obviously this place has a better, divey vibe, which I like."
"I love stopping here whenever I'm in Chicago. My first visit was sometime at the end of May in 2017, and I loved it. I don't travel that often, and I thought I would never get to eat here again. But then I found myself in Chicago on September 2, and made a point to stop here.When I arrived, there were people waiting outside for tables. I realized that things were probably not going to work out for me with regard to getting a table. When I stepped inside there was barely any room to move, because so many people were waiting either to get to the host stand, or to order food to go or to pick up their to go orders.I got to the host stand and I was told that there was an hour and a half wait. I asked if I could place an order to go, and the host indicated that I could but that was a separate line. I got in that line and when I got to the front the woman with whom I was speaking indicated that there was a place at the bar and that I could sit there if I would like. So I did.When I sat at the bar, the bartender/waitress indicated that there was an hour and a half wait. I've already been told this by the host I had already accepted it. I placed my order and then sat and waited. About an hour and 15 minutes later my food came to me. It was hot and delicious. Deep dish pizza with pepperoni, green olives, and pineapple. Suck it if you don't like it. I love pineapple on pizza.When I was about finished eating, a woman who had come in about 30 minutes after I did, and who was also sitting at the bar, said to the bartender ""I'm a food blogger, and I was hoping to give you a good rating but having to wait an hour and 15 minutes for a personal size pizza is bullsh*t."" The bartender apologized. And then a few minutes later gave the woman an update and told her that her food was coming out soon. As I was already in the process of paying, I wrote on the back of my receipt ""I am NOT a food blogger, and I'm sorry that you have to put up with that. So I am giving you a larger tip than I normally would have because of that woman."" So I tipped her $9 on a $25 ticket. I showed her my note, and she got a good laugh. She packaged up the rest of my food to go, and I left. The end."
"I got a small (10 inch) meatball, onions, spinach and garlic and I could only finish 3 of 4 slices and I'm a big guy who was pretty hungry. I didn't really like the burnt crust gimmick they have but the cheese and ingredients were quality and overall it definitely filled my expectations for a Chicago style pizza I had to try as a tourist. Definitely better than Giordano's, but maybe I gotta try Lou Malnati's or whatever it's called and compare it to that.My bartender Jennifer was pretty attentive and kept the refills coming."
My friend and I came at a really great time. A little bit after they opened when the crowd isn't there yet. We ordered their famous deep dish pizza. You get to choose the toppings. Each topping is $1.85 so don't go too crazy because that is how you get an expensive pizza.They have a sign for you telling you that it will take about 40 minutes for your pizza to be ready if you order it. My friend and I have small stomachs so after a slice we were pretty full.
Chicago pizza... the real deal! This place is zero frills but some of the best damn pizza I have ever had! Coming to Pequod's on my last day in Chicago was like the cherry on top of my birthday weekend sundae! Looking forward to making a stop at this place a Chicago trip tradition. The $5 personal pizza lunch special seemed too good to be true... but it wasn't!
"The pizza here is amazing!! The dough is thick, and nice and crusty on the bottom. The edges are just covered in baked cheese, so every bite has great flavor. The toppings are a bit pricey, $3 each, but they PILE them on, so I would recommend just choosing a few. The pizza takes a while to cook, which they tell you up front, so just get an appetizer to munch on and relax. Or, come outside of peak lunch/dinner hours. The appetizers are pretty standard fried fare, don't expect much. The pizza slices are very filling, so a large pizza stuffed four hungry people. Definitely recommend visiting!"
"Fantastic deep dish pizza.  Far superior to Giordanos and the other tourist places, this comes from a guy who was born in Chicago.  Only downside to the place is the long wait and parking can be tough in the area.  That being said it is definately worth the visit."
"Everyone and their mother has told me to check out Pequod's, and it really is the epitome of deep dish. I've tried many other deep dish places but this one definitely stands out in the ratio of crust to cheese to toppings.Eating in the actually restaurant, my cousins called for preferred seating which is not a reservation but to be able to be seated quicker. They told us the wait for them to make pizzas is about 40 minutes, but we didn't mind with our large group while we drank. The second pizza we ordered came with the wrong toppings and they were kind enough to make a new one and give us a discount for the wait."
"There's not a single bad thing I can say. I'm from NYC, where everyone knows a NY Slice is one of the best things anyone can have. And as the pizza lover that I am, trying Deep Dish or Pan Pizza in Chicago (whatever you'd love to call it), has been on my bucket list my entire life and these guys did not disappoint. Started off with Mozzarella Sticks to hold off the long wait, and it was one of the best I've had. Not even going to lie. Super crispy, full of cheese, good for a beautiful cheese pull. And then came the pizza. And my goodness was it tasty. We got extra sauce, pepperoni, half pineapple (for my lady) and half sausage (for my half). Every single bite had a tremendous flavor, not excessive in dough and the iconic crispy/burnt crust was soooo good. Its one of the things they are known for! So happy we chose Pequod's! Our waiter was super attentive and checked in throughout. Can't wait to return when we are back in town! Thank you!"
"My favorite of the deep dish genre in Chicago. As a newbie to the city, I have always been on a quest to find the perfect deep dish. I have traveled to 4 locations and Pequod's is by far my favorite. The crust is thick, the sauce is flavorful, and the toppings are fresh. Definitely worth it!"
"Yum, yum, yum. And I don't even like things like the ""burnt"" caramelized crust. But here, delish! Always hopping. Especially on a nice summer night. Lots of families even though it was later in the evening since the kids don't have school. I got lucky and snagged a bar seat to eat at right away so I didn't have to wait for a table. That's a nice thing they've got going on there. See a seat open at the bar and you can grab it and order your meal there. The bar tender was awesome. He made sure my Arnold Palmer was always filled before I hit bottom and did it perfectly. Super friendly and nice. Speaking of nice, the hostesses are always pleasant as you walk in. Let you know wait time, etc. The pie was nice and gooey. Eat your pizza there. It's repeatable but absolutely best eaten hot and fresh. I like to get the combo of pepperoni and sausage on this pie. Nice amount of sauce. These people appreciate your business and always treat their customers well. It's a fun, loud atmosphere with a unique take on deliciousChicago deep dish. I'd much rather come here than some other pizza joints that ignore you and are lackluster in both food and people. Can't wait for the next time I'm nearby and stop in."
"After hearing about the long lines at Pequods, my husband and I decided to go at around 3:00 on a Wednesday. We were seated right away, but there weren't many open tables. The service was quick and friendly, and perfectly attentive. We ordered buffalo wings and a pizza 1/2 sausage and 1/2 meatball. The wings were really good. The pizza was delicious. The crust was crispy with cheese, the sausage, meatballs, and tomato sauce were super flavorful. We liked the sausage a bit more than the meatball. The downfalls: the meat was unevenly placed so there were many bites with just cheese. Also, by the time we got to the second piece, the bottom crust had gotten a bit soft. Regardless I would definitely go back and recommend it to others."
"Best deep dish I've ever had! This spot came highly recommended, and I was not disappointed. We were expecting a small wait for lunch, but were quickly seated when the host realized he had a free high top near the bar. A personal big component in eating near a bar is the amount of distraction (hubbub, TV, etc), and it was perfect- plenty of sports options, but not so overwhelming that you couldn't focus on your conversation. We started with the garlic cheesy bread, which was sooooooo good! It came with a little cup of marinara, which could have been bigger (I mean come on, marinara), and was steaming and fresh. Totally worth burning my taste buds.And then the pizza. God, the pizza. I was interested in the caramelized crust when I saw it on the menu, and it was AMAZING. Normally I have to get really motivated to eat an entire pizza by myself, even a personal size, but this pizza was the motivation. I honestly questioned whether it's still really that unacceptable to lick a plate. Best place to start my time in the city, and I'm craving it now that I'm gone!"
"I live this place. Be prepared to wait unless you go at an off time. There are a few bars I'm nearby, so you can stop in for a drink waiting for your table. Nothing else to comment about besides the deep dish. All of the other food is average, exactly what you would expect, (salads, apps, etc). The pizza is off the charts, my favorite deep dish in the city. Carmel crust is the nail in the coffin. So delicious, I typically get the sausage since it's not your typical store bought Italian sausage. It's fresh crumbles that make for an unbelievable pizza. Go here if you want the best Chicago deep dish experience in the city"
"This is my experience after a few trips to Pequod's. There is always a wait...always. You just have to accept that fact and plan accordingly. Have been hear with small groups at 5 a d at 7, and no matter what, you'll have a 45-60 minute wait. However, the pizza is pretty darn good, the crust with caramelized cheese however, is AMAZING!! I legit could eat 5 lbs of the crust, I'd be sick, but happily so. The toppings are always plentiful and service doesn't take too long, about 40 minutes usually. Service is okay, considering how busy a d over worked the staff always seems. Prices are decent a d I have heard they have an amazing lunch special that is really a bargain. Personally, I think this is better than Lou's and the rest of the Chicago staples for pan/deep dish, and if you are patient, will be happy you waited every time."
"I've never been a big fan of Chicago deep dish pizza, the first time I had it (at another restaurant) I wasn't impressed so I was hesitant to have it again.  I heard so much and read so much about this place that I decided to give Chicago pizza another try.  This is more unique than other places, they have the cheese on the side that burns, I love that!  The sauce really made the pizza really delicious.  I couldn't stop raving about the sauce!  All the ingredients are fresh and delicious.  Keep in mind, it takes about 40 minutes for the pizza.  The wait wasn't that bad, and the service was great.  I highly recommend if you're in the Chicago area!"
"Hands down amazing pizza and worth the wait! There are hour long waits for very good and delicious reasons! If you don't mind sitting at the bar as opposed to waiting 1+ hours for a table, then it's first come first serve!We were expecting to wait 1.5 hrs, but luckily bar space opened up so we snatched up those seats right away. Sitting at the bar also has its perks, because you can order and receive your drinks right away. We ordered the Fried Mushrooms, Half Order of French Fries, and the Small Pan Pizza with Mushrooms, Sausage, and Spinach!The Fried Mushrooms were perfectly Fried. The inside wasn't complete mush or still raw. The Half Order of Fries were also seasoned well and not overly salty. The given wait time for the pizzas are 1 hour, which makes sense since something this good takes time. The appetizers helped to satiate the hunger as we waited. The pizza was phenomenal! The crust was just so perfectly buttery and crispy at all the right places. The crust was not damp and soft from the cheese, sauce, or toppings like how some other deep dish places get. The toppings were very generous! The sausage piece were the size of meatballs!"
"A must visit if you are in Chicago, most if not all locals suggested this was their favourite deep dish pizza in Chicago. Personally I preferred Lou Malnati's but the rest of the party said Pequods was their favourite by far. Great atmosphere, excellent drinks and they tell you the wait time for deep dish pizza as you walk in."
"We waited for 2+ hours to eat Chicago deep dish. TWO HOURS. Yet, we destroyed our half cheese, half mushroom-jalapeño pizza in about 10 minutes. We accomplished this fest not because we were ravenous, but because the pizza really was that great. Compared to the big deep dish names in the city, this local pizza joint boasts flavors that ensnare the senses. The tomato sauce is more than just sugar and tomatoes, but a blend of Italian herbs that flood the mouth with a full, umami experience. There is a healthy amount of fresh mozzarella cheese layered on the pizza, the kind that pulls away in long beautiful strands with each bite. I loved that each bite was a burst of cheese and sauce, with a fluffy bed of crust to cradle it all from beneath. There was no grease at all on the bottom of this crust, and the ends are definitely not going to be skipped: additional cheese is toasted to a crisp on the edges and is a special surprise at the end of each slice. Deep dish looks overwhelming and can certainly be excessive. However, this place managed to strike the perfect balance of flavors and breadth. We left stuffed and happy, not gross, and I couldn't have asked for a better first deep dish experience in this city."
"It took me forever to believe my friend's assertion that Pequod's was really THAT DAMN GOOD...but now that I've been here, it really is THAT DAMN GOOD. There are so many things about Pequod's deep dish pizza that make it superior to any other pizza I've had in Chicago. Their trademark crust made of caramelized mozzarella cheese instead of extra dough. The sweet and tangy tomato sauce that balances out the crust. The fact that they use a ton of mozzarella cheese, but it never gets too stringy at any point. The plentiful amount of toppings they throw into their pizza unlike other places in Chicago (yeah, I'm looking at you Giordano's). The super high quality meat they use in their pizza. Bottom line, if there is such thing as deep dish pizza perfection, Pequod's has achieved it!If you're trying to wonder how much is the right amount, a large pizza is RIDICULOUSLY huge and should be more than enough for four people. And the wait for the pizza to cook is about 30-40 minutes, about what I expected.Service was pretty friendly, I have zero complaints on this end.Sometimes you gotta call it how you see it immedaitely, and I'm calling it right here: Pequod's has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago!"
"A pizza poem! You can eat here but you do u know em? Located in Lincoln and pick ur toppings, With garlic, peppers, sausage--there's no stopping! The classics are the best here I can't deny, The top deep dish in Chicago I won't lie!There's room at the bar to dig in your teeth, A pro tip to remember when there's not a seat. The first time you go skip the apps and not the pizza, Always order extra sauce and extra cheese--duh!So if u live here or aren't local give it a try, Guarantee you'll enjoy this pizza pie!"
"WoW oh WoW Im not a big pizza fan first off I may have it 3x a year tops and have never really liked deep dish but this completely changes the game for me. I fell in love. My mother and I both had the lunch special ( a personal pizza with soda for $5 wow!) Only downside is the pizza takes a while to cook so I have learned to call ahead so the wait is not as long. the personal size is enough even if your big hungry, tho you will be wanting left overs later. I am already craving going back!"
"My Chicago friend recommended this place. Upon entering, we saw the sign that said it will take 40 mins to make the pizza and we were already starving. We ordered the chicken fingers which was regular and came with bbq sauce in a to go container. The chicken fingers were crispy just the way I like it. I thought the deep dish was ok. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious but nothing spectacular. I felt like I had something similar. It had the right amount of meat vs cheese and dough, wasn't overwhelming! A small deep pan for 2 is more than enough for us. They had the lunch special, a personal cheese deep  pan and drink for $4.95 I believe, such a great deal if you don't mind just a cheese pizza."
"When I tell you this place is that place? It's THAT place. Had this a while back, but just now getting to the review. Piquods is a weird little restaurant (maybe bar??) that we found out in Chicago. It's mainly famous for having a whale with panties on it's head or something like that...  while the inside joke of that or why it's a whale goes completeeeeely over my head, let me tell you, it's the best Chicago pizza I've had thus far! That crust is to LIVE for and it's sooooo thick. The cheese was just dripping off fresh out the oven and I enjoyed every last bite!If you're ever in Chicago, please check out this place because I know whenever I go back, I'm gonna get this again along with a few other spots I didn't get a chance to go to. Trust and believe you won't be disappointed."
"Super busy location after being seen on the travel channels food show.We ordered the pepperoni and sausage deep dish.It's a traditional tavern, bar & grill type establishment.  It was seen on Food Network or the Travel network and so it was extremely busy when we walked in the only tables are available for two chairs at the bar. Which I prefer.We received our food within 20 minutes and the bartenders were extremely nice.The restaurant was clean and I can highly recommend this restaurant."
"This was a fantastic deep dish pizza. It's the best I've ever had. I don't think there's much that can be improved upon. Do not go anywhere else. Do not mess with your one chance at an excellent Chicago style deep dish. Come with an empty stomach, with your sleeves rolled up and you won't be disappointed. Definitely get the caramelized deep dish. There is no other way to go. A small feeds two people. Medium can work for two very hungry people. The pizzas are dense and they do not skimp out on the toppings. I don't think I have ever had better Italian sausage than what they serve. I won't even ding them for this but the pizza came out a bit luke warm. It wasn't pipping hot, burn your tongue and the roof of you mouth. So that's good. But then again the pizza cooled off rapidly. I am not really sure what I am getting at by saying bus because I both appreciate how it wasn't too hot but then again it became a bit unappealing when it cooled off. Maybe I'm hard to please. The service was great. Just attentive enough to not be annoying and get what we needed. The place is your standard brick walled pizza shop. Our wait on a Friday was about 30 min at peak dinner hours. Not bad! I highly recommend this place. This is just about as perfect as it gets."
"Coming to Chicago I had to try some deep dish pizza and after extensive research, I settled on Pequod's. Everyone was raving about their ""caramelized"" aka burnt-looking but not really burnt crust.What I wasn't looking forward to was the hour plus long wait that everybody mentioned. Fortunately, it only took our pizzas about 30 minutes to come out. This was likely because we ordered personal-sized pizzas. The pizza was delicious as was the crust. The personal size ended up being more than enough. It looks deceptively small until you remember that it's deep dish, so I actually had some leftover. We got some apps beforehand because we expected the pizza to take longer to come out (cheesy garlic bread and fries), and I'd recommend the cheesy garlic bread."
"ONE OF THE BEST PIZZAS IN CHICAGO!! Forget those chain deep dish places, this is where it is at!"
"My friends and I went out to eat tonight and it was my first time coming here and I was impressed.We were told the wait was gonna be 30 minutes but it was shorter than that which was great. Also, we were told the pizza would take about 40-45 minutes to make, but it came out sooner which was also great.Our server Kelly was really polite and kept coming to check on us every so often. Will definitely be coming back"
"Came to Chicago for a friends New Year's Eve wedding so we didn't have much time in the city. My boyfriend suggested we hit up this place, Pequod's. Super cold 2 degree afternoon, snagged a table by the door( that sucked) but the service and people were great. We immediately ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom deep dish and buffalo wings. The wings came out lightning quick and we devoured every last one. That sauce was amazing!As we waited 45 min, my impression of this place fell a bit. Since we were by the table by the door, the 5pm traffic flow came thru and people were crowding around us at all sides. My chair was getting smacked by people walking behind me, getting their coats snagged on my chair. By the time our food arrived people were hovering over our deep dish pan, faux fur from people's coat hoods literally above the pan. My boyfriend had his back to the main entrance(which was worse than my seat) and people were literally talking loudly in his ear and hovering over our table while we attempted to eat dinner. We asked to switch to a booth and the waitress was unable to make the switch happen. Not a huge fan of deep dish to begin with but if I were in town again there's a chance I would swing by."
"Came in for a late night grub. Holy pizza. We ordered half pepperoni half veggie, extra crispy, and extra red sauce on the side."
My favorite deep dish in Chicago! Good beer selections and you can buy pitchers ! Good as take out/delivery but the best eaten in house. Nothing fancy about it -no frills just some good pizza !
"Forget Giordano's and Lou Malnati's; come HERE for the actual best pan pizza in Chicago. Not quite deep dish, but the crust is thick enough for my liking. There's only one location in the city, but no matter where you live, it's worth the trek!"
"This review has been a long time comin! As a Chicagoan let me break down the significance of Pequod's to you. Gene and Jude's is to the native Chicago hot dog as Pequod's is to native Chicago pizza. Both of these places are highly over looked by tourists but deeply loved by us natives. If you're newly introduced to either, well, better late than never- just get wit da program! Until my most recent visit I strictly ordered the deep dish (i never say pan. sorry not sorry.) because that's what they're known for! This will probably be the crispiest deep dish crust you'll ever have and instead of a nice handled crust to hold onto it's sloppy & a little burnt. Perfectly imperfect achieving even more crunch when you've reached the top! Thin crust is equally good but that shouldn't surprise you because even the littlest mom & pop pizza place cranks out the best thin crust. Chicago pizza is unbeatable. Chicken tenders and no cheese garlic bread are a must for appetizers. Just don't forget to leave room for the pie. (Pizza pie, duh. not dessert. lol)Dinning during prime time weekends you're looking at an hour+ wait and impossible parking. Can vouch that this is a great place for large groups. They accommodated our group of 20 allowing us to make resos and place our order in advance. 7 Pizzas and 1 Italian Beef. Only one pizza order was incorrect and for the most part, service was good. They will not seat your party unless everyone is in attendance. Thankfully, that was no problem for this group of Elites! Special Shout Out: To our honorary guests-Yelp Team Leaders wishing them a farewell, to Christopher V for suggesting Pequods, to Ahmad A for all he did for us that night (We still owe you, Friend), to everyone who was in attendance & on time (blown away by your punctuality!!), & to Selena C + Liang H for planning!"
I'm visiting from Cali and asked the locals the best pizza in Chicago.. And this is it.
"You will just have to trust me when I say..don't be scared of the 60-90 min wait time to sit down and the additional 45 min to have your pizza cooked. IT IS ALL WORTH IT! I promise. That is why I have constantly endeavored the gruesome act of my stomach battling me inside. So if you do decide to come on a weekend night for dinner, don't come hungry. Come when you think ""yeah I'll be hungry in about an hour or two."" There is also a bar connected to the restaurant called Whale Tale, where you can wait to grab an app and drink.Now, be prepared for the best deep dish in the city. No BS, it'll end any Jordan/Lebron argument.15/10"
"My love for deep dish pizza started with Lou Malnati's during my first visit to Chicago and it only exponentially increased when I had dinner at Pequod's Pizzeria. The wait for a table and for pizza can be long, but I really appreciate that Pequod's is blunt and straight forward about the wait. My friend and I came to the restaurant on a Sunday evening around 6pm and waited about 45 minutes for a table. While we waited, we headed a couple doors down to a bar also owned by Pizano's. When we finally got a table at Pizano's, we ordered wings and fries to munch on while our pizza baked. We ordered a small deep dish pizza with sausage. The crust is absolutely delicious with melty cheese baked in a cast iron skillet. Pizano's is also very generous with their toppings. Between the two of us, we finished the wings and fries, but we were only able to eat a slice of pizza each. I gladly asked for a box and enjoyed the leftover pizza as a midnight and breakfast the next morning. Only downside was that Pequod's a bit of a trek from our hotel."
"Dang. I wanted to love this place but I'm just not there yet. EVERYONE says that this place is truly the best deep dish place in Chicago. The one that locals, and not tourists go to. While I can vouch that it seemed pretty void of the tourist disasters that are Giordano's and Lou Malnati's, it still didn't blow my mind. I felt that the cheese and sauce on the deep dish were lacking flavor - the only thing that impressed me was the flavor and consistency of the crust. We ordered a ""thin"" crust too, and it was super thick - and not that good. Service was great though and I liked the low key atmosphere. Overall I would give it another shot. And would still come here over any of the other deep dish places in the city."
We went on a pizza tour.  So yummy!  Service was good!  Only issue was very inconsistent slices for our group.  Mine was literally two times as big as my husbands...but likely due to serving big group. Sausage pie was so good!
"Yumyumyumyum the crust and the dough are delicious. The service was attentive but be prepared to wait for your thick, luscious pizza to be cooked. I got cheese and tomatoes. My friend got pepperoni, green peppers. The medium was just right to stuff us with no other appetizer."
"This place is a bit of a jaunt to get to if you're using public transportation, but it's worth it. We were seated right away, upstairs. The temperature of the restaurant was a bit uncomfortable, too hot. The restaurant is a bit dingy, but hey, we're here for the food. We ordered a pan pizza with sausage. It was delicious! Really large, flavorful hunks of sausage. They caramelize the edges of the crust, so it ends up being a slightly burnt mix of cheese and crust. In comparison to other deep dish places, I'd say the crust here is thinner and there's less cheese. It's also quite a bit cheaper than other deep dish places."
"Deep dish pizza is a Chicago thing and Pequod's sure executes it well enough! I've been to almost all the deep dish place you can name in Chicago but still like Pequod's better. And yes their pizza does have more bread and it's charred at the bottom (which is the best part). Other appetizers are not bad too for your regular bar food.Just be aware that this place is overcrowded over the weekend for peak dining time, and would be a long wait if come with a big group. To what level? Well, there was one time a group of my friends came here, put our name down, went across the street to watch a movie, and then came back to get our table. if you come a bit early or only a few people, the wait isn't too bad."
"""Real Chicagoans don't eat deep dish!"" I'm a real Chicagoan, and I'm telling you, that statement is WRONG. Especially when it comes to Pequod's. Don't get me wrong, there is a time and place for deep dish, but if you're making that time and place for it, Pequod's can't be beat. The crust is absolute perfection. Great portions of both meat and veggies. And just has that ""pizza place feel"".There's not much else to say. Pequod's has the best deep dish in the city."
"Looking for Chicago style pizza? Then you need to check out Pequod's!! It's usually very very busy, so try to make a reservation ahead of time. We came here as a group of six and ordered a few appetizers and two medium pizzas to share, which was more than enough! For apps, we got the cheesy garlic bread, bruschetta and breaded shrooms. I highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread, which comes with a marinara sauce on the side, as well as the breaded shrooms. I mean c'mon, fried mushrooms!! The bruschetta was underwhelmingly flavorless. For the pizzas, they weren't kidding about the caramelized crust! This is hands down the best part about the pizza. I'm typically more of a thin crust pizza kinda gal but Pequod's makes me wanna change my mind!"
"Went here on a Friday night with a reservation for four people. Had to wait about 15 Mins to get a table. Not bad at all. I'm a White Sox fan so all the Cubs stuff was great to see (haha).Restaurant has an upstairs that I didn't notice was so big. We requested the table right in front by the entrance but to no avail. Host did what she could (I think!?)I knew I wanted some of this caramelized crust I kept hearing about. Also knew the pizza would take 45 Mins so we ended up ordering two appetizer combos and some wings (wings suck). The fried platter was LIT. Zucchini and BOOMERS were en fuego. The table ordered some beers and a margarita.But let's get to the pizza...pepperoni and sausage pan. Both awesome. Crust was the boss. Better than Lou Malnatis and Due/Uno. I love places that have a large following and there aren't a ton of locations.Parking was easy to find too. Our server was good but VERY upset about a table next to us that told her they felt ""pressured"". As Kramer says, POISE COUNTS!If I want deep dish or pan pizza, I'd go back. If I want stuffed in the city I have to find my way to ART OF PIZZA!"
"Always have enjoyed deep dish pizza. Pequod cheese pan pizza small size and a personal of sausage, onion, and mushroom was ordered. The personal was a bit on the soggy end to my liking. I think partially due to the toppings. The cheese was perfect. Crunchy, a little doughy, but enough sauce and cheese for each bite. The burnt crust was also tasty and not overly charred. Overall had a good experience and with good company"
"I don't even know where to start...When we planned our trip to Chicago, we had made a list of restaurants to try based on recommendations from friends and colleagues. Pequod's never made the list. What a sad mistake it would have been to have missed this place. Fast forward, we are in Chicago, dining at one of our favorite restaurants in the country, when we strike up a conversation with our server. We give him the list, for his take, and he immediately questions why we have omitted Pequod's? We all look at each other and shrug; never heard of it... He went on to tell us that it's the best pizza in Chicago. Well then, on the list it goes. So, on our last day in town, before heading to the airport, we made it in. The hope was it would live up to the recommendation as this would be our last meal in town. And boy did it! The great experience started with the fist call. I asked if they could store our bags (party of four, each with a suitcase) and reply was ""we don't have a spot, but head on down, we'll figure it out"" - love that!We get there and the place is packed! That said, they found a spot for our bags and we were seated within ten minutes. The appetizers were great, especially the fried zucchini and fried mushrooms. The beer selection was great. And finally, the deep dish (extra cheese and mushrooms) was to die for. We hit Lou Malnoti's and Giordani's on the same trip, but Pequod's blew them out of the water. Do not leave Chicago without giving them a try!"
"We made a visit to Chicago for the marathon this weekend. My boyfriend, who is the runner, requested classic Chicago deep dish pizza for his post race meal. Our server another restaurant actually referred us to Pequod's. We took a short metro ride and a lovely walk through Depaul University to get to the restaurant. The wait was 1 to 2 hours but we were able to find a seat at the bar. The food was absolutely incredible and I am so glad that we were told about this spot. We ordered the bruschetta and a deep dish pizza with meatballs and canadian bacon. We weren't able to finish it all in one seating and happily took it home for a snack later.   When I make a return trip to Chicago I will definitely make this one of my meal stops."
"Pizza- check, sauce- check, carmalized crust - check! This pizza and cornbread crust is to die for. Sometimes the crust can be a little too carmalized but sometimes you get that sweet perfect bite by the crust and its just heaven. One of my fav pizza joints in Chicago."
"Had to give Pequods a second trial after so many people raved about them. Second time around, pequods stole our heart. We ordered sausage, pepperoni, and onions; it was delightful. The crust is so fulfilling (my favorite part is the burnt cheese). Definitely a must try. There is usually a long wait but the buzzers they give you as place holders connection reaches to the bar next to Pequod's- go get some dranks while you wait! P.s. fried mushrooms hit the spot as an appetizer"
"So by recommendation of a local Chicago resident, we decided to partake in Pequod's for a real legit Chicago Deep dish pizza.  This is a small joint with old school charm but for all the right reasons.  After a short wait, we got to sit upstairs which we didn't even know existed.  We started with the appetizer platter of fried cheese, zucchini, mushrooms and hot poppers.  I love fried cheese however the hot popper was the winner as it pleasantly had a cheddar cheese/pimento mix instead of what the normal cream cheese that I'm accustomed to and it was delicious.  But that's not where this journey ends, as recommended by the waitress we had the Supreme deep dish pizza.  The pizza takes 40 minutes to cook so I had time to have a house salad, which was good but I should have not wasted stomach room as the main event was coming!  The pizza arrived.  Giant cast iron pan filled with mushrooms, peppers, onions, and sausage - homemade sausage made in house.  I'm not usually a fan of sausage on pizza but this place is the  exception, soo good.  Sound good?  I haven't gotten to the best parts!  The crust was crunchy on the bottom but perfectly cooked  which made the best vessel for all of these toppings and then we get to the sauce!  Oh my!  I don't think I need a pizza to eat this sauce but it sure went well with it.  This is my first real Chicago deepDish pizza and was possibly the best pizza I've eaten thus far.  I truly want this pizza at home and it makes me mad knowing I cant( no offense to my pizza owner friends) but I have a totally new respect for deep dish and what we have is not deep dish, for true!"
"Was really impressed We went here on a tip from a Uber driver Solid 10 for the deep dish crust was perfect, sauce had a nice little bite with a hint of spice,  that went well with the meats we chose and a 10 inch was perfect for 3 people we'll be going back for sure"
"Pequod's serves pan-style deep dish, with sauce underneath the toppings. The thick, crispy, black edges are the perfect vessel for lots of cheese and a variety of toppings that include Italian beef, meatballs, spinach, giardiniera and more. If I had to pick one pizza place in Chicago to send my friends when they come to town, this would be it."
"My biggest problem with the pizza is that it is too doughy. But I come to realize this issue varies day to day. It is less likely to occur with smaller pizzas. With bigger pizzas, I add extra tomato sauce (not an ideal solution).Overall, pequod's is a good pan pizza. It's caramelized cheese crust is to die for which is properly a very accurate term because there is no way burnt cheese is good for you. However, the pizza does lack some texture balance with the dough. And, unfortunately I do find this distracting to my eating experience. Don't get me wrong! You should still go out of your way to have this pizza if you haven't had it. It's unique. Just don't expect it to be the best unless all you care about is the caramelized crust."
"I love pizza in all its forms: NY style, New Haven style, and Chicago-style. This was certainly worth the wait. I ended up going online a few days ahead and getting on the priority list, which made getting a table on a Friday night only 15 mins.It is very crowded so don't expect much for elbow space. Our waitress was awesome and quickly got our orders in (because Chicago-style is 45 mins of cooking).  We ended up getting a small pepperoni pizza for two and it was the perfect size with leftovers and not feeling completely disgusting. The sauce was incredible and crust quite flaky. Highly recommend going!"
This is seriously the best pizza I've ever had in my life.  You want real Chicago deep dish?  Then forget Lou Malnati's. Forget Giordno's.  Come to Pequod's.  They cook the pizzas in cast iron deep dish skillets.  It gets served to you in the dish with all amazingly delicious crispy edges.  The pie is so full of the toppings you select.  We had a pizza with sausage and you can tell the sausage is home made.  This place is pretty big too.  You walk in and think the only tables are there on the main floor around the bar but the space goes back a ways and there's an upstairs.  It's a great space for sports viewing as there are TVs everywhere.  Pretty decent beer selection too.  We had to wait about a half hour for a table which was fine.  They have a space next door where you can order a drink while you wait.  Just expect to have to wait and plan ahead.
"Ah where to begin! Chicago is notorious for their deep dish pizza and besides Lou's, I would recommend staying away from the Big 3 (Gino's East & Giordano's) because of Pequods and Art of Pizza. Don't get me wrong, the Big 3 are good, but I prefer Pequods over them any day. I have been here many times and Pequod's is one of my favorites in Chicago, but I ordered delivery for this review. Pequods is a official Blackhawks bar and it has a limited selection of beer on tap. It's two floors and the place is actually kind of old/grungy, but it really doesn't matter because you come here for the pizza anyways, right? In my opinion, Pequods has the best and biggest toppings in Chicago. It would probably rank as the heaviest deep dish pizza in Chicago! Their tomato sauce and bottom crust isn't the best, but it does it's job. To be honest, the bottom layer of crust is quite dry. The tomato sauce is a little wet, but it is flavorful. Lou's, Giordano's, and Art of Pizza have better sauce. But the best part about their pizza is the caramelized cheese crust! It looks burnt, but trust me is it glorious! I highly recommend ordering extra cheese as it gets applied to the crust. Two slices will definitely fill you up and it's about 2,000 calories. But it is worth it! Service is usually adequate and their appetizers are ok. I've had the Jalapeno poppers and cheese sticks, but they're average fried food. The salad was ok as well, but you should really save yourself for the pizza. Wait times can be very long at peak times so it's usually best to get on the preferred table list. Here are my rankings for deep dish pizza in Chicago: Art of Pizza, Pequods/Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Gino's East, and Nancy's Pizza. Piece Pizza actually might be my favorite in Chicago and it's New Haven style."
"In the beginning, there were Mount Vesuvius tomatoes that inspired the pizza napoletana (my favorite pizza). Later in 1900's, her younger sister, New York-style pizza was born (my second favorite). Many years later, their giant big-boned Chicago deep-dish brother was delivered. This pizza snob dude tried four deep-dish pizza big names in Chicago so far, and I hereby dub Pequod's  my favorite. However, do you know what the best part is about Pequod's pies!! For me, it was those caramelized burnt ends!! People don't like their ''cornicione''. But I found myself eating them, non-stop. My criticism is they pour a lot of sauce into the pizza. So when you're working on it, the sauce will burst all over your face and most importantly your beard. Thanks to some awesome Chicagoan friends, I was invited to a small event over here. We were about 20 people. Michelle, the organizer, pre-ordered lots of pizzas. To be safe, I ordered a small thin crust cheese pizza, because I'm a part time vegan. Michelle said it was the best among all pizzas ordered!! I really liked it. The cheese amount was a generous Midwestern portion by default. I would've loved more crunch on the base. But you know how it is. The flavors were there, 4.2989899 stars. The waitresses were efficient but you can feel they were pressurized as it was so busy and crowded. The place is old and dim from inside. But who cares if you have a fancy photographer friend like Daniel to make photos look amazing!. Location by the far nicely crowded western side of Lincoln Park is so smart and full of life. I had much fun meeting with new yelp friends over here. Cool people. My buddy Alex A was a must to be present, as usual. PS. my 26K marathon runner buddy from New York LOVES this place. Would definitely come back for those caramelized cornicione."
"Food taste wise its delicious. My only complaints are how crammed the inside is, and felt a little nickle and dimed (got a big order of cheesy garlic bread that came with no marinara which seemed odd and got charged for the mini cups they brought us when we asked, weren't told we'd get charged for each one either) Food wise though the pizza is delicious. Split... or at least tried to split a small with a girlfriend and we didn't even close to finish it. Next time I'm back in Chicago this will definitely be back for the pizza, they know what they're doing in that kitchen."
"03/23/18 - Last night an unofficial Yelp event was held as a farewell party for our former Chicago CM Alex S at Peaquods Pizzeria @ 2207 N Clybourn Ave in Chicago.  In Alex's S. short stint as Chicago CM he has did a great job of bringing together some epic Yelp events.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank him and to wish him the best in whatever his future endeavors are.  It was a fitting tribute hosted by Michelle, Salena & Liang at Pequod's Pizzeria for Alex S.  I was honored to be one of the chosen to attend the farewell party.As far a Peaquod's pizza I love the caramelized crust on the perimeter of the pizza, but I'm not especially fond of the thick soft doughy interior of the pizza.  Like many of the pizza restaurants they have both thin & the thick doughy pizza crust which I got to try both last night thanks to the thoughtfulness of the 3 ladies that took the time to canvas the 20 or so people in attendance to try and find out what their preferences were on pizzas.  I mentioned to Michelle that while I appreciated the thoughtfulness of doing that, it is very difficult to please everyone and suggested maybe a vegetarian options for those non meat eaters & a mix of meat & other toppings as it is hard to cater to everyone's individual choices.  Naturally I was surprised when both Michelle & Liang told me my pizza with sausage, mushrooms, black olives & garlic was sitting on the table as requested.  Thanks to the ladies for organizing this event for Alex S.  We all want to wish the Best for Alex S in his future whatever that may beThis is the first time I ate at the Clybourn location so it was kind of cool to see the restaurant which is a 2 story restaurant.  As I arrived I ran into Sarah S outside.  As we walked in we were told they had 2 groups upstairs in the 2nd floor dining area.  This is where we met our fellow Yelpers.  When it came time to pay the girls were working out the bill when Ahmed A came up and snatched the bill out of their hands and paid the bill for the group.  Thank you Ahmad That was a very unexpected and generous thing to do. I give 5 stars + for the cool Yelp people at the event, but only 4 stars for the pizza.  Very good pizza, but my favorite pizza is Lou Malnati's butter crust."
"Pequod's makes the best deep dish pizza. I left off the elusive 5th star for one reason, well actually two. ..extra sauce. ..extra cheese. Make sure you order both & load up on toppings. Pequod's isn't at it's best with simple one or two ingredient pies. These mandatory additions (which should be standard) will make all your deep dish pizza dreams come to fruition. Let me explain.Pequod's doesn't serve the traditional Chicago deep dish pizza with a thick cheesy layer, instead there's a deliciously crisp bread-like crust with a caramelized cheese rim (see pics, it's not burnt despite the color). The extra sauce and cheese balances out the thick crust. All the standard toppings are offered and always fresh. No arugula, artichokes or pesto drizzles if that's what you're into. Just delicious satisfying pizza. Be forewarned the cook time is 45mins to an hour, but well worth the wait. Some tips suggest placing your pizza order with the hostess as you wait for a table. This was not an option during my last three visits. I suggest ordering wings and sit tight until perfection arrives."
"Came in for my mom's birthday on a very rainy and icky Saturday. I had made a table request online the day before, which I would recommend because it seems to be crowded at all times, including 2:30pm on a Saturday.We came about 20 minutes earlier than our reservation and they were still able to seat us after only about 5 minutes of waiting. We grabbed drinks at the bar, I was pleasantly surprised to see they had Krombacher on tap.We were seated on the main floor towards the back, but they do have an upstairs that gets more natural light and looks to be a little more spacious. The seating is close-quarters for sure, but nothing super uncomfortable. Frankly, it is a pizzeria that has a bar and is not fancy, pretentious or otherwise, no frills.We kept it super simple and just ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza. We were advised it would take 45 minutes, but it came out in less than 30 minutes, so that was great!The pizza itself was fantastic! As others have said, it is not exactly like other Chicago deep-dish/stuffed pizza. This has a caramelized crust that is crispy enough to add good texture, but not like other deep dish where you need a knife to cut through it. I liked the sauce a lot, it has a little sweetness to it. Really a fantastic blend of what seemed like good quality ingredients. Not skimpy on pepperoni, cheese or sauce, everything came together wonderfully and we had a lot to take home from a large between 3 people. It's filling but I actually would argue not as ""stuffing"" as traditional deep dish.Our server was good, we didn't really need much, literally just ordered the pizza and that was about it.Great spot for a unique pan pizza, nothing but good things to say about Pequod's, I'm a big fan."
"Finally, after trying 4 different pizza places in Chicago, this takes the cake for the best Chicago pizza I've had! I think this is what we envision when we say ""Chicago deep dish pizza"". However, it did remind me of Pizza Hut's pan pizza since I think they use a pan pizza base/structure, but different crust and sauce of course. It made me appreciate pizza hut's pan pizza! LolWe ordered sausage and pepperoni on our pizza and let me tell you, the sausage here is amazing! So definitely order sausage if you can."
Walked from our hotel for a city tour walk to eat at Pequod's.  We had to have the traditional pan pizza.  It is a great family neighborhood restaurant that you will love.
Two thumbs up for Pequod's Pizza. Cool little old brick building with a hip vibe. The service awesome.
Excellent pizza and great service. Looks like a small place from the outside but we'll accommodating
"Having only had Lou's when visiting Chicago in the past, I was looking for deep dish pizza at a location that was favored by the locals and was not just a large local chain. My sister suggested Pequod's having been there before and I'm glad we came here.We were lucky to easily find the table as the 45 minute wait for the pizza is agonizing when you are starving! We ordered a medium deep dish pizza and customized one half while leaving the other as a cheese pizza. The pizza was amazing, the crust in particular was delicious. The servers were attentive even as the place got busier the later it got. Definitely, would recommend Pequod's to anyone looking to try deep dish pizza while in town."
"Finally made it to Pequod's when an old friend was visiting from out of town, and just like everyone says, it is GOOD.It did take the full 35 minutes or so for the pizza, but that's to be expected with any deep dish. They just have their standard sizings of cheese pizza, and you can add whatever toppings you want - so we got peppers and mushrooms.  The whole place smells amazing, and when the pizza got to the table we were all practically drooling over it. The cheese is so meltey and perfect when they serve the slices onto your plate, and they've got a solid proportion of sauce to cheese to crust.  The best part is probably the caramelized edges of the crust, but the whole pizza eating experience was all in all amazing.If you like deep dish - go to Pequod's."
"Although I'm not the biggest deep dish fan, this was definitely my favorite over Lou's and Giordano's. Their pizza is lighter and has an awesome crispy crust. It also feels much more traditional and less of a tourist trap than some of the other chains. The only time we eat deep dish is when people come to visit from out of town. This will be our go-to spot from now on!!"
"What to get: pan pizzaService: 5/5Atmosphere: Casual, sports barWait: 45 mins (Saturday 11:30AM for 1)The Experience:Another out-of-towner trying to get a taste of that legendary Chicago, deep-dish pizza. I should specify that this is a pan pizza, where it has a caramelized crust rather that a fulling-encasing thick crust. That extra crunch at the bottom of your pizza is what you're after.Even when it just opens, you're going to have to wait. It gets crowded easily and even as a solo diner, I nabbed one of the few spots at the bar. The waiting is actually for the pizza to cook. A personal size takes about 45 mins. Just choose your toppings, have a drink, and wait.The staff is attentive since they know you'll be waiting. The name of the game is waiting here. If you can do that, you're rewarded with a stellar pizza. A personal size is filling enough for 1 person. I even took some home to eat later, but it is similar to eating a pie. Best part is that crunch from the crust with the gooey cheese melting all over.It's a wonderful must-try if you're in town."
I ate here while in town and fhe food ans service was great!  Cant wait toCome back!
"Attention, attention!! I don't care who you talk to or what they say, Pequod's Pizzeria is by far the absolute best pizza in Chicago.  I am not exaggerating. There's nothing else like it! I've ordered delivery and dined in at this fabulous locally owned establishment and I've never been disappointed. While the wait may be long depending on the day and time, it's totally worth it. Do yourself a favor and ignore the hoopla surrounding the larger pizza chains around the Windy City and eat pizza like a local!I'm pretty basic when it comes to my pizza options... I tend to stick with a plain cheese pizza and I douse it with red chili flakes and dip it in ranch. This pizza is what I believe most people would describe as a pan (deep pan) pizza, however it's truly unique and unlike any other pan pizza I've had. Not only in Chicago, but anywhere! The crust is buttery and caramelized to perfection! The crunch is amazing and gives it the texture you need when it's topped with ooey gooey cheese and red sauce. So delicious and filling. You're welcome! I can just picture the huge smile that will spread across your face as you devour your first Pequod's pizza... or your 50th (wink, wink)!"
"Insanity. Pure insanity. This place is fantastic and the pizza was the best we have had on our trip. The cheesy burned cheese goodness on the edge was fantastic. Thankfully it was the Blackhawks official bar, it was empty and had no wait. LETS GO PREDATORS!!!!"
"Is there a TEN STAR button?!?!?!   Noel was freaking AMAZING and it is the best pizza I have ever had in my 37 years on this green earth!    The meatball app warmed me up enough for the wait and the House dressing was fire!   But I swear best cheese, best pepperoni, best crust and unreal amazing customer service.  No question no doubt I'll go back!"
"Love love love Pequod's! This has to be my favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago. I'm not a local, I'm not a native. Just a foodie Yelper who loves Chicago style pizza!I've had the typical places like Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, which are also good in their own rights. But when you pile your cheese high over the edge of the dough that it crisps up and makes each bite of the crust tantalizingly cheesey, how can you say no?I'm a classic with the sausage, which here consists of giant blobs of pure deliciousness and the best kind of kick to your encasd meat. They pile the toppings on sky high so you don't have to worry about bring jipped of the $2+ per topping. Honestly, my most recent visit consists of sausage, pepperoni, and green peppers and I had more toppings in each bite than dough, which is not a bad thing.Whenever I get meat toppings, I find that there's always enough sauce, but looking at the table next to me last night, who got all veg, I did notice it was a little drier than ours, so I can see why people ask for extra sauce.Even with the hour long wait to get a table and 30-40 min for the pizza, I still love it here. I do say, plan ahead - cause waiting nearly 2 hrs will get to you. I come hungry, but not hangry, and grab a small appetizer to share to tide free table over. 4 people, a medium pizza with app combo was about $10 a person. Definitely worth the trip!"
"The best. This is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago and I've lived here 30 years. I've gotten into arguments with people about which is THE BEST (between this and Lou Malnatis) but in those debates Pequads is always part of the discussion. It speaks for itself as you'll always find a line out the door of people waiting to get a table. It's a short wait (and they have a seated indoor place next door you can wait in), but worthwhile one. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality Chicago pizza."
"I've had Pequod's a couple times before (dine-in and delivery) but decided to stop in today for their awesome lunch special deal before a movie. For $4.95 you get a personal sized cheese pizza and a fountain drink-- it's an amazing deal! I added giardiniera and pepperoni (each topping was 80 cents) and a side salad ($2.50 extra). When it comes to Chicago pizza, I'm typically a diehard Lou's girl but I was really impressed by Pequod's-- especially for the price! The personal sized pizza had a lot more of the crunchy cheese on the crust that Pequod's is famous for compared to the larger pies. I would skip the side salad next time as it had not been spun properly and left a huge puddle of water in the bottom of my bowl. That amazing lunch special does not include any refills on drinks. My server never offered me another one which I gladly would have paid for. I'm in the service industry so I definitely understand the woes of a lunch shift where everyone is spending $5. It certainly wouldn't deter me from returning. Overall, this was by far my favorite Pequod's experience. I will go back next time I'm going to Regal Webster."
"After a 2.5 hour wait...yes we hung out for that long, we were not disappointed. We had individual an pizzas; mine was sausage and mushroom and friend's was peppers, garlic, and pepperoni. The caramelized crust/cheese is what makes this Pequod's. Hip joint with upstairs area. Loud when crowded! Definitely will bookmark and be back next time in Chicago!"
"I had seen Pequod's on the Food Network and it was also recommended by locals, so I had to give it a try while in town for the race on the previous day.  I came in during lunch, so I had the lunch special, which includes an individual stuffed cheese pizza and drink (no refills) for $4.95 + tax. An extra topping is 80 cents, so I got bell peppers.  The lunch special is available weekdays from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM.  You definitely cannot beat that deal anywhere in town, especially for the quality of the pizza that you get.The pizza itself is very good, just like everybody says!  It has a nice buttery crust that is nicely caramelized on the edges.  Despite all of the rave reviews, I think it is tied with Lou Malnati's for the best Chicago style stuffed pizza, which are both definitely better than Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, and Giordanos.  However, Pequod's is definitely cheaper than all of the others, especially for the lunch special.  Pequod's stuffed pizza also has a higher crust to toppings ratio than the others, but that is OK with me...I know some prefer less crust and lots of cheese like Lou's prepares.Since it is so good, you can expect a wait since the dining area is quite small, unless you sit at the bar, in which case there is no wait if there is available space.  It is also very dark inside, and also very noisy and crowded.  If you are claustrophobic, you will not enjoy the dining area. People were bumping into me while I was trying to eat.If you are a fan of Chicago-style stuffed pizza, I highly suggest Pequod's."
"This deep dish pizza is really good but is heavy. Got the deep dish pizza with Italian beef. It was really good, my critic to the pizza though is the crust is heavy and with all the sauce and beef it just keeps adding on. But to make up for the crust is the upper crust of the pizza is amazing. They melt cheese on the top crust and it looks burnt but is not and is to die for."
"Soooooo good!!! I think they have the best pan pizza (deep dish).Ordered half fries, half wings, tossed salad, and a small pan (cheese, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms).Everything was amazing.The side crust is carmalized so it's basically a cheese crust. The bottom crust is more doughy so it's more of a thick toast than a regular pizza crust."
"Yes this pizza is excellent.  However, I am just not Into the signature burnt crust.  Admittedly I totally inhaled three slices of deep dish pepperoni and mushroom.  And the scale showed it the next day.  This pizza IS excellent.  It all comes down to personal preference."
"During my short trip to Chicago I had a tough decision deciding which deep dish pizza spot I would visit. I ultimately boiled down the choices to either Lou Malnati's or Pequod's and ended up picking Pequod's. Pequod's is not located in the touristy area of Chicago so I ended up having to catch an Uber here. Not wanting to wait a long time, my friend and I decided to stop by around opening time @ 11. We were quickly seated upstairs upon arrival. Our waitress was very friendly and was very attentive the whole time we were there. I opted for the personal pan pizza with green peppers, sausage, olive, and mushrooms. Keep in mind that toppings are not free of charge so it can quickly add up. The pizza came out within 10 minutes piping hot. It's worth mentioning that their personal pizza's don't come in the skillet. The thing that stood out to me most about the pizza at Pequod's was definitely the crust and the tomato sauce. The tomato sauce tasted very fresh and the crush was not too overwhelming. The toppings I opted for were not overcooked and paired well with the pizza. At the end of my meal I was glad that I was able to try out a Chicago deep dish pizza and throughly enjoyed it.Overall I had a positive experience from food to service at Pequod's. If I were to be 100% honest though I personally prefer NY pizza compared with the Chicago deep dish. The deep dish got a bit tiring for me near the end of my meal. If it's your first time in Chicago as a tourist, I would highly recommend trying out a deep dish pizza. I can't compare between Lou's or Pequod's but I'm sure neither one would disappoint as they both have very positive reviews on Yelp."
"How have I never been here before!.... it still strikes me to say this, but they're... *taking a momentary pause. not for drama. more because it still hasn't sunken in, yet* .... I think I like Pequod's more than Lou Malnati's.I'm actually sad that I haven't been here sooner.I'm actually resentful that nobody's told me sooner.I'm actually pretty angry because I could have had much more Pequod's in my life, and what if my life had been over before I never even tried them.And maybe I'm in denial, and just haven't had a good pizza fix lately, as if being Chicago-born doesn't entitle me to a bit of pizza-coinnoisseur-ness, and I've shamed other 90'kids TMNT lovers by having denied myself such ooey-gooey-goodnesss..... I think these are stages of grief.BUT OH, HOW THIS PIZZA MAKES MY HEART SOAR!to find out that they sometimes have a 3-hr wait, makes perfect sense. That it has an adjacent bar next door, which is the DEDICATED space for waiting for your table --- also makes perfect sense. No... it's not pretentious. Pequod's is just that serious. This is like the Disney World for pizza, where you look forward to it, and expect the wait (on top of 45 min cook-time wait) because standing in line earns your right to taste the Pequod glory.OK ok I'm really over-embellishing.. it's just that Chicago is so rampant with pizza, that it remains difficult to be impressed.  But even their tomato soup was bomb dot com! ... and I sure love my tomato bisque from Panera, but DANG. it was slurptastic.... Even the leftovers were just as amazing. It's nice because their crust is crispy all throughout, unlike other competitors that can rave about a butter crust, that you have to commit to a slice to get to that tasty finisher at the end.  Every bite has that buttery finish.Idk. IF you haven't yet, you're missing out. I recommend a party only of up to 4 people so you don't have to wait, and to go at an off-time (like during the week, or before/after typical dinner service).  If you can eat 9 or later, I think that would be prime time to come during the week. Wow. I just can't say enough great things, and I'm already salivating, waiting on an excuse to come back."
The best pizza in town! I do not care what other people has to say but this is it. I would always bring my friends that are visiting here for a good ol' pizza. The toppings are generous! And the wait is certainly worth it.
"5 stars for the pizza. 3 stars for the service. We arrived in Chicago for a short three day vacation and wanted some good Chicago style pizza. Upon recommendation, we gave these guys a try. We ordered a few standard appetizers which were pretty good with how basic they were. Then on to the main dish, the Chicago style pizza. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. We kept it simple with pepperoni, sausage, peppers and onions; and we were not disappointed. From the large chunks of toppings to the buttery crunchy crust. Words can't describe the awesomeness of this pizza. I highly recommend the pizza here. Trust me, you will not be sorry."
"From the outside it looks small but when you go in boy is it spacious!! Folks had been telling me for years about the pie at Peaquods but being brand loyal to other Chicago pizzerias I paid them no mine. The unique thing about Pequods in my mine is the carmelized crust on the deep dish. The sauce has a nice balance as far as zestiness. Ate some deep dish, ate some pieces of thin crust. Enjoyed my Coca Cola! Refills were done promptly. Had a reservation with a tremendous group of people and we all enjoyed ourselves.I think it's neat how Pequods has a good reputation but it isn't of the old guard of Chicago deep dish places. It signals to the world that the torch has been passed to a new generation."
"Pequod's salad was amazing, get the Caesar dressing as it comes on the side. Jalapeño Poppers were good, they messed up our order of the sauces but corrected it quickly. Mozzarella Sticks were very good.We ordered two pizzas and, while they were good, I cannot say they were great. The caramelized crust was good but I would not say it made the pizzas. I am a big fan of Lou Malnati's and, in my opinion, I would choose a deep dish sausage from Lou's over this. The big question is would I come again? Taking into account the wait, the pizza and the cost = No. For me Pequod's is one and done."
"I'm from the area, and I have always thought deep-dish is gross. Pizza often makes me feel sick due to an excess of cheese and bread, so I only eat it if I know it will be worth it to feel terrible later. This stuff was the s**t. Not exactly deep dish like other places, but a deep pan pizza with a large amount of the toppings you ask for. I was surprised by how good it was and by the insane amount I ate of the spinach and onion I got - was also glad we got an appetizer as the wait is long (although they are very clear and up-front about it). I used to tell tourists that they were the only ones who liked deep-dish and locals thought it was meh, but it turns out I'm a fool who was just going to the wrong place. One star off because the A/C does not seem to be working there and it was crazy hot."
"You can't beat the $5 lunch deal at the best deep dish pizza spot in the city. While the tourists flock to Lou's and Giordanos, the true Chicagoans know that it's all about the crispy cheesy crust, the savory smooth sauce, and the toppings for days on what can only be described as ""crust with the perfect amount of pillowy, bready goodness while still remaining crunchy.""Pequod's is the best. Get there as early as you can to avoid waiting for 3 hours. Call ahead to start your pizza order so you don't have to wait 45 mins once you sit down. And get a side of ranch to dunk your 'za. Trust me on this one."
"Hands down best Chicago style pizza I've ever had!! I went for lunch and found that the personal pizza is the perfect size! I had nothing bad to say about this pie, it has enough sauce, cheese and whatever ingredient you choose to enjoy it completely and the burnt cheese as the crust gives the pizza an incredible crunchy taste! Besides the lunch special is perfectly priced and impossible to pass by. My experience at this place was so great that I did not mind the 45 minutes the pizza took to be made!"
"A m b i a n c e:Dim lighting, indoor seating on 2 levels, TV's, like a chill sports bar without obnoxious drunk people. Be patient, there will be a wait, but it's worth it. N o i s e  L e v e l: Kinda loud, tables are close to one another, so it can be a good date night spot. D r i n k s: Beer, wine, cocktails, and soft drinks.F o o d: Always get the deep dish pizza, it's the only kind a true Chicagoan will eat proudly. The ingredients are delicious, the sauce is not sweet, a great balance of toppings/crust/cheese/sauce ratio. Ranch dressing is also amazing. R e v i s i t: Yes, duh!"
"Late and quick lunch at one of my all time favorite pizza places in the world...Glad to see the quality of the pies hasn't declined since the passing of the owner/founder, Burt Katz... Personal Deep Dish with sausage and mushroom... Every pizza can be a personal pizza! Service was fantastic sitting at the bar..."
"Pequod's is delicious! Hands-down one of the best Chicago Deep Dishes in town.They are ALWAYS busy - especially on Cubs game days! I think they started delivery finally, so I will have to give it a try. I'm not a fan of waiting outside when it's cold for an hour+ for a table. The lunch special is awesome."
"As far as pizza goes, pan pizza if my favorite vs thin crust and deep dish and ny style.  I love all the carbs that go with pan pizza and pequods does it the best."
"Sitting in Hinsdale on a Sunday afternoon. Wife: Oh I could go for some pizza! Me: Mmmmm, Pequads!Wife: Yes, but that's so far!Two hours later (including drive and wait) we had the best pizza in front of us!! Thank you Pequads for existing. Now come to the Southwest suburbs so we can be even more friends."
"Yum! This has been my favorite pizza place in Chicago. We went on a Thursday evening around 7 and only waited about 10 minutes for a table. The Pequod's salad and garlic cheese bread as apps were great and came out quickly. The pizza took the expected 40 minutes and was cheesy, saucy, and crispy."
"I knew it would be hard to find a favorite pizza joint with a short trip to Chicago. And I know I still have many more to try. But after many recommendations for this place and trying a hand few pizza joints, this one. Pequod's. Is BESTEST (ok maybe it's tied with Bonci but these are completely different places that  also should both open up in Houston... please?). I prefer cheesy pizza with a thick yet crispy crust and savory toppings. Toppings like Giardiniera. If you like mildly spicy, tangy type flavors, you better add this stuff because it's a pizza game changer. And just thinking of their lightly burnt caramalized crust makes me want to get back on a plane and Uber straight to pequod's. Great place to spend a Sunday watching football with fantastic pizza and beer."
"I got mixed recommendations about Chicago's Deep dish pizza. Some of our friends recommended skipping it, others compared it to a heavy casserole. Our friend and host recommended that we try Pequod's Pizzeria. I'm glad that we did!This Chicago style pizza is deep dish is made with a caramelized cheese crust. So the crust is cheesy-burnt, the bread is light and fluffy and you get a massive amount of sauce and toppings! The small sausage deep-dish easily fed 3 of us (me, K and a friend). Other than that, the service was great. The setting is bar/pizzeria. There is more seating upstairs. If you reserve with priority seating requests, you cut your wait time in half! I definitely recommend this style of deep dish!"
Worth the uber from our hotel! Super small; got lucky and got 2 seats at the bar.  Delish pizza and beer!
"Probably one of my favorite deep dish pizza places in Chicago.  It's hard to compare Pequod's to other deep dish joints, since this reminds me more of a pan pizza (which I guess is basically deep dish) but the crust is just different than the chains in Chicago.  The crust is fluffier, spongier, and more like bread than it's chain competitors.I really like that it's not a chain, locally owned, and there is only one in the city.  On the other hand, this makes getting a table sometimes difficult.  Going on weekdays and off hours helps with this.  Toppings are good, they have other appetizer options, but pizza is the way to go here.  Always been cooked well and never burnt, no complaints."
I was blown away. Was never a fan of deep dish but this place changed my mind. While the place was dingy and kinda cramped I will definitely be here again!!!!!
"Definitely the best pizza place in Chicago. It's kind of a weird cross between a pan pizza and a few dish pizza. The crust is crisp and buttery like that of a pan pizza, but it's deeper and denser than a normal deep dish. That being said, I prefer it over all other deep dish or pan pizzas in Chicago. Our go to toppings are pepperoni, garlic, and onion.  We usually don't get garlic on our pizzas but someone recommended it to us and we've gotten it every time since!  However, if I had to pick one reason why this is my favorite, it's the crust! Smallish place, so I'm sure there could be long waits from time to time. We usually get it to go and max out on our couch at home."
"This is a long overdue review. My friends were asking for food recommendations in Chicago and hands down, this restaurant is what the locals look for in deep dish pizza. Yes, be prepared to wait long but the great part is that they let you put your order in while you wait for a table. So once you are seated, your pizza is already cooking and waiting to be devoured. Don't be skeptical on how much a personal sized pizza can fill you up because my boyfriend and I underestimated and actually ended up ordering way too much. The deep dish pizza is so filling especially after ordering a generous amount of toppings. The crust is cooked to perfection, fluffy as a marshmallow but so much flavor in each bite. Just thinking about the pizza makes my mouth watery. Oh how I wish I could have my hands on a Pequod's deep dish pizza again... It really was love at first sight as you lift up a slice and all the cheese just oozes out."
"Pequod's has the best pizza on earth, hands-down. Out of all the joints we have tried in Chicago, this one is the best. The sauce is perfect, not too sweet and very hearty. The burnt cheese crust is so much more delicious than we ever could have imagined. It doesn't taste burnt, just good. My favorite thing about Pequod's is that they don't skimp on toppings. If you order pepperoni, prepare for it to be completely covered - sometimes 2-3 ronis thick. I love it. It is my favorite stop in Chicago. Highly recommended."
So I'm generally not a fan of pizza but I really enjoyed the deal they offered for lunch more than the pizza :P Def going to come back here because why not have a slice and soda for a price that won't hurt the bank account!
"I cannot believe I waited so long to finally get here! Ugh. I miss it so much. I wish I could eat Pequod's for every meal of every day.First, let's talk about the infamous wait time...Spoiler alert! The wait time was non-existent when I went at noon on a Friday! Amazingness! Score! Woo hoo!Next, let's talk about the lunch deal...It's about $5 for a personal pizza and then you can add a side salad for an additional ~$2. Well worth it! Okay, the salad dressing... UNREAL! They have homemade ranch and it's the best. It was perfect for the salad and obviously for pizza dipping. The pizza is beyond epic. The caramelized crust is everything it is cracked up to be and more.And last but not least, the service and the atmosphere...Every single employee was so happy and friendly. The interior kind of made me feel like I was in a pub. Okay, so Pequod's is like a neighborhood pizza pub. Well... Not LIKE a neighborhood pizza pub. I guess it IS a neighborhood pizza pub!If you want to get an authentic Chicago pizza experience, Pequod's is a solid place to check out! Get there!"
"I don't know how I've lived in Chicago for this long without reviewing Pequods. I am proud to say that without a doubt, Pequods is easily my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. It's a little different from your typical Chicago deep dish, and honestly reminds me more of a round Detroit style pizza with a buttery crust, carmelized edges, and sauce on top. In any case, it's awesome. Recently I discovered they offer fresh garlic and Giardinara as topping options- not sure I'd get those two together but both are nice additions. They get crazy busy on the weekends but you can put your name in and get a drink or appetizer next door. During the week the wait is shorter, if at all, and they have a really great weekday lunch deal too. They are open late, and while they do deliver, I don't feel as though it (or any deep dish for that matter) travels well, so I recommend dining in. It's also a fun place to bring your out of town friends who have only been exposed to the big chains."
"Hands down the best pizza in chicago! Born and raised here and yes it's better then Gino's East and Girodano's! If you love cheese, this is the place to be. The crust on the deep dish pizza is caramelized cheese! It makes the pizza! Plus the pizza is very affordable compared to other Chicago deep dish pizza spots. The lunch special is about 7 or 8 bucks for a personalized pizza and fountain drink. There's also typically a line in the evenings so if you're going with a larger group, be prepared for a wait."
"stopped in here for st. patrick's day dinner. as a first-timer to chicago, i really wanted to try deep-dish. didn't really matter *where*, i just wanted *some*. my boyfriend's friend recommended this place in lieu of a lou malnati's or something more popular. i will say this place was absolutely, ridiculously packed with people. we waited about 30 minutes before receiving a beeper... then 30 more minutes for a table. then about an hour for our food. i knew going out ANYWHERE was going to be a bear, so i was patient. got a salad to start. it was underwhelming. but the pizza? LAWD. i got a small pan pizza with extra cheese, onions, MEAT FRIGGIN BALLS, and spinach. ughhhhhh. it was so good. it tasted like a casserole. the crust was divine... sweet and almost caramelized. i can't WAITTTTT to come back here. on a regular weekend."
Literally my FAVORITE Chicago pizza spot! The Italian beef and giardinara is my go to. The pizzas are always perfect and super filling. I like to carry out because the restaurant itself can be very busy. It still tastes great but nothing beats fresh pizza straight from the pan in the restaurant.
"Arrive knowing there is a long wait and no reservations nor a waiting list. Get a drink and watch one of the TVs while waiting for your buzzer to signal that your table is ready. Get a preview of the pizzas as they are delivered to the tables. There is a nice sized dining room and bar on the street level. However, there are stairs behind the bar that leads to the spacious upper dining room!  More TVs, windows and brick walls up here. Started off with the Piquad Salad which was packed with colorful veggies and dressing on the side; jalapeño poppers (not spicy, wish they were); mozzarella sticks (not impressed but teen son loved them). Ask for the marinara dipping sauce, it's really flavorful. While you endure the 50 minute wait for your pizza, the waitresses refill your drinks (complimentary soda refills!!).  Gave me time to organize my photos from the Chicago Auto Show. Impressive looking pizza!  Served piping hot and your first slice stays hot from first to last bite. And that's all I could eat because we had a lot of appetizers. But, this pizza is so good!  Love the burned edges on the crust. Added a unique flavor as it's not a ""burnt"" flavor, kind of sweet tasting."
"As an out of towner hearing a lot of hype for this place, I must say I don't think it lived up to the hype food wise. I think it's a personal preference thing, my wife said if she could only have 1 pizza the rest of her life, this was it. I personally didn't care for the crust, it felt to me like pizza thats been left out, kind of stale. Like I said, it's a preference thing. I am giving them 4 stars however because they accidentally threw away the 1 slice we were taking to go when boxing it and they replaced it with a whole pizza. A+ service!"
"Really, really good deep dish pizza ; they're rated highly for good reasons. Not fine dine just a bar and great food.Highly recommended. The crust is absolutely the best part ...the crust should be eaten first the deep dish crust has the perfect savory with delicious burnt edges .The popular ones either load  too much cheese , too much meat or too much sauce. At Pequod's that was not the case.One of the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. The sandwiches are good as well the "" combo sandwich"" ( sausage and beef together ) are delicious."
"Wow. This place lives up to the hype. We got mushroom and beef. Delish!We came at 4:45 pm found street parking right across the street and had no wait. They said the wait time would be 45 mins for the pizza. It was actually closer to 30, maybe less. We also got the app combo. It was ok. I probably wouldn't get it again."
The best deep dish I've had here in Chicago and the wings are good for an appetizer while you wait for your pizza to be cooked. We got here at opening time and the line gets long so be early and come hungry.
"The legend is real! This place was ranked #1 on a few different websites in regards to being best pizza in Chicago, which is saying a mouthful. After ordering a medium deep dish sausage & pepperoni, I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find a better deep dish in Chi town! Everything about this pizza was heavenly; the carmelized crust, the sausage, the cheese, the sheer thickness & weight of each slice, good gosh! This pizza was so good, I had it my last night in town and ziplock bagged the rest to take on my flight back to the west coast. As I'm writing this, I still have one piece left...Go try it, you will LOVE each bite."
Pan pizza heaven! The Pequod Salad is also exceptional. Go early if dining in or do carry-out. We love the Morton Grove location.
Great pizza and very unique to Chicago. The deep dish has a caramelized crust that is to die for. There are long lines most of the time but so very worth it.
"I love this place, it is just extremely crowded if there is a Cubs game going on. The pizza is perfection!"
"Called ahead for a table request on Saturday but had no issues getting in at 12. The tables do fill up fast with every table taken around 1. We ordered 2 large pizzas (8 slices each) and both were amazing! The toppings are very plentiful, the sauce is great and the crust makes this pizza better than any other deep dish I've had. The place isn't glamorous but the smells hit you right when you walk in and you'll be anxiously awaiting yours to come. Definitely understandable how this place tops every persons deep dish pizza list!"
"Pequod's offers a bit of a twist on the traditional Chicago-Style pizza you would get at a Lou Malnati's or Giordano's.  Their ""burnt"" crust is something you'll either love or hate, but I am a fan, and most people I've eaten Pequod's with are as well.  Solid sauce and toppings, but I find the overall quality of the pizza to be a clear notch below Lou Malnati's and Pizano's in the fight for best in Chicago."
"My brother raved about this place and took us here for some deep dish pizza while in town. And let me just say, it was amazing pizza!! The crust was thick and well done, but not overly done. And the toppings were a plenty. My SIL and I also shared the Pequod salad (a half order) and it was really good as well.Only downside is the service we had was terrible. The waitress never came back to check on us or refill our drinks throughout our entire meal. We got the deep dish pizza at least 15/20 mins before the thin crust, so our kids were starving...we had to even ask twice where the thin crust pizza was. We asked for a to-go box and the waitress brought us a completely flat (not put together) box and sort of tossed it on the table.Service aside, I would definitely go back if I am in town, because the pizza is really really good."
"Amazing deep dish pizza! I have never been a huge fan of deep dish pizza so I was a bit hesitant to eat here! We came in around 7P.M on a Wednesday night and we were immediately seated on the second floor.We came as a group and ordered the full order of hot wings as an appetizer! They were loved at the table, spicy enough to satisfy you, but not enough to burn your mouth. I ordered a full order of a caesar salad and split it with my boyfriend. The salad was large enough for both of us and even had some extra to share with another person. However, the salad was very plain and only had 5 croutons on top of it! Another negative about the salad was that they give you the dressing on the side so you have to mix it! Do not get the salad, nothing special to it.We ordered two medium pan pizzas for the table. One was pepperoni and jalapeño, and the other pizza had meatball, Italian sausage and pepperoni (pictures attached). The pan pizzas were both big enough for a group of 5 people (2 children) and we even had to take some home! I highly recommend coming here!"
"Pizza was amazing!  We ordered the thin crust and deep dish.  They give you a generous amount of toppings on the pizza and unlimited toppings to choose from on their menu.   The restaurant is rather small so the wait was rather long..  we got there and they said that it would be a 45 minute wait and then another 60 minutes for the pizza to be prepared.  Get a small appetizer if you are hungry, but this pizza place is highly recommended !"
"This place has GREAT food! Stopped by on a Thursday evening about 630pm. The place wasn't packed and immediately got a table. They do have a sign at the hostess station saying pizza can take about 40 minutes, which we were ok with. In the meantime, ordered a couple of beers and wings. Buffalo wings are delicious! Just the right spiciness to savor the flavor and enjoy them. We ordered a medium thin crust and a personal deep dish. The thin crust is not very thin, almost had the ""regular"" hand tossed thickness to it, but very flavorful. If you're a fan of pepperoni the way we are, get extra of it. The top layer is nicely charred and crispy with tons of flavor. The deep dish crust is also nicely charred and crispy and gives the pizza that extra flavor to satisfy your taste buds. This place is known for their deep dish and I could see why...the mixture of that sauce with the cheese and pepperoni was superb! The only reason I'm give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I truly enjoy a thin crust, crispy pizza, and this was not like that. Nonetheless, everything was delicious and will definitely visit when I'm back in Chicago! Check it out!!"
"Yep. Yep.......Yep, Pequod's lives up to the hype. We waited a while for our seat and pizza, but that was to be expected. I love the collaboration with Whale Tail to drink through your wait time. Parking was pretty easy in the area and in the end the pizza was amazing. We split a small and it was too much for us. I will say I'm glad I ordered extra cheese! The cheese is amazing!"
"Worth the wait!! Get your spot in line, then go next door to Whale Tale while you wait (30-45min for us on a Saturday evening). The bar is owned by the same people, so even if you aren't finished with your beer before the table is ready, they'll radio over and hold your table. This pizza is a MUST when you're in Chicago. Authentic deep-dish. Not too much cheese or too much sauce, and the perfect amount of crunch in the crust. Pequod's salad was a great choice as well. Very friendly waitstaff. Four of us shared a pitcher, a salad, and a large pizza with more than enough food to go around. We creeped on a guy sitting at the next table over who had some pesto ravioli that looked pretty delicious as well!"
"What can I say? Pequads is one of a kind when it comes to pizza in Chicago. Not to say that the Lou Malnati's and Giordano's aren't amazing, because they truly are; but if you haven't made your way over to pequads yet you are seriously doing yourself a disservice. Brace yourself, they don't take reservations and because they're so amazing they almost always have a wait. They do however offer what they call priority seating. This means if you know you're planning to come, they'll take your party's name and size and you pretty much get to cut to the front of the wait line when you arrive. We did this last night when we were here for a party of 5, and despite having a crowd waiting at the door, we were seated immediately. They have a well stocked bar available (also great during your wait for a table) and solid appetizers. Obviously the token item here though is their pan pizza. The crust is out of this world. It's got a crisp, caramelization to it that IMHO almost single handedly makes this my favorite pizza in Chicago. Furthermore, their toppings are baller. My favorite is the sausage and giardiniera. Yes, it's got a bit of a kick to it, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy/hot foods and still can't get enough of this. I've heard their Canadian bacon topping is also out of this world. Do yourself a favor, get to pequads ASAP."
"Went here for dinner with my friend after seeing a movie at Webster Place Theater. I had my name put on the priority seating list before the movie and afterwards it was only a five minute wait. The service was great, our waitress checked on us frequently. The food was excellent , we had an antipasto salad and a pan pizza. Just some of the best pizza in Chicago and I have plenty of experience in that category. I found legal free parking in the area, but that was at 4 pm. Had a great time, highly recommended."
"A Chicago staple that completely rocks. Recently waited on a Sunday for an hour and didn't eat until 10 but Pequods is 100% worth the wait. Their little buzzers still work 2 doors down at the Whales Tale bar and across the street at Barnes and Noble if you need to kill time and don't wait to wait inside the restaurant. For how busy they were, the service was great, the pizza was delicious and we left fat & happy. Good beer list. Pro tip: extra sauce. Do it. Our bill was about 60 bucks between three people and we got the Caesar, beers and a large pan. Super reasonable!"
"Being newish to Chicago a few people had recommended Pequod's so I gave it a try.Overall the pizza was pretty damn delicious. A thicker yet airy dough, flavorful sauce, plenty of topping options and a very delicious crispy crust. I do however think there could have been more cheese. With deep dish/pan I just expected it to be cheesier. I appreciated the selection of appetizers and salads. Since the pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook it was nice to have something to eat while we were waiting for the main dish. And although I didn't get desert, it was also nice to see that a pizza place had so many options for sweets. Service was great. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us during the appropriate times. For a Tuesday night in early spring we waited about 20ish minutes to get a table around 6 o'clock. I'd say the earlier you can get there the better chance you have of not waiting in line for super long. And if at all possible try to avoid the tables by the door. Large groups can form while people wait for a table and it just feels awkward having people so close to you while eating. Even the waitress was annoyed as she was trying to work her way through the crowd to get to her patrons. And at one point people were literally leaning on the chairs at our table while we ate. I get it, it's cold outside but really do you have to be right on top of me as I eat dinner?"
"I'm from Chicago. Pizza matters. And this is my new ""You must go here for pizza"" when friends are visiting. Thank you for existing."
"We perused yelp for the perfect place to try true Chicago style deep dish pizza and settled on Pequods as our choice. I'm so glad that we did because the pizza was as delicious as I'd expected to be and then some. The cheese creates a heavenly, caramelized, crunchy halo around the crust and the favor of the sauce is wonderfully deep. It was perfect. Definitely a must-try for those looking for their own deep dish experience!"
"Coming to Chicago, my main mission was to try deep dish pizza. After asking recommendations from many locals for places to try, I decided to come here.I came during lunch and it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait. I got the lunch special which is a personal size pan cheese pizza with a soft drink. I decided to add spinach on half of the pizza to try.It did take a while for our pizza to come but they do everything fresh to order and there was a large group ahead of us so I didn't mind as much.My first bite into the pizza was amazing. I love the crunch of every bite I took as well as the balance between sauce, cheese and dough. It wasn't too cheesy, or sauce, or doughy, it was perfect ratio. I dont know how they keep the outside part of the pizza to be crunchy but the inside was still soft and doughy but it was good. The only critique I had was that there was literally only 4 pieces of spinach on my half side and had to pay extra for it.Overall, it was a good pizza and I can see this as my go to pizza if we have this in Washington."
"O...M...G....The best pizza, period.  The crust, wow.  What other deep dish pizza can you think of where you can pick up the slice and eat it with your hands without it going everywhere?  Crispy bottom with carmelized cheese around the crust that makes it amazing.  Service is good, not great, but the food makes up for it."
"Delicious pizza! The restaurant is bigger inside than it seems since there is an entire upper level with seating. Pizza does take about 40 minutes but they let you know that up front. The sides look like it's black and burnt but it's really crisp and delicious and does not at all taste burnt. Pizza is a bit on the pricey side with toppings being about $2.50 more a piece. I do wish the pizza had a little more cheese to it, so next time I may order it with extra cheese. All in all it was delicious and we will definitely be back."
"The best pizza in the effing world. I live in New York and I've traveled through Italy. I've eaten a lot of pizzas in a lot of styles. Nothing can top this pie. I had this pizza for the first time at the Morton Grove location well before the Food Network makes it one of the top five pizzas. Now when I visit Chicago, I come to this location because it's way more convenient and the pizza is the same. The wait is always insane but it's worth it. This visit, I came at 4:30 to beat the rush. I was seated immediately but told that my pizza would take 45 minutes from the time I ordered. This was good - I've waited over two hours just to get a table before. I'm not adding anything new by gushing over the caramelized cheesy crust. It's well established that that crust is what sets it apart. The dough to topping ratio is also on point, and the sauce has the tiniest hint of spice which makes all of the flavors sing. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've dreamed of this pizza."
"Any time we make a trip downtown we have to stop here even if it's just to pick up a pizza to go. Love the pizza, the burnt cheese crust and the piles of pepperoni that is on it! It's pretty much always busy but there's a reason for that...it's delicious!"
"Delivery/take-out review - I've never eaten in, the wait is always atrocious.Overall: Great pizza, but it can be hit or miss in terms of the waiting periods for whether or not its worth it.The good: When it's good, it's REALLY good. Hot and fresh, its on top with the best of Chicago. The carmelzied crust is signature goodness, and the thin crust is really good too. They pile the toppings on high, the sauce ratio is plentiful, and the meat is always loaded. The crust is thick and crunchy.The not-so-good: On one occasion, the super bowl, the order was terribly late and incorrect. Not sure whether to blame doordash or Pequods. Also, if the pizza is late and cold, it's not nearly as divine."
Delicious. Awesome that you can order ahead and just sit down & eat. Good service. The air conditioner was unfortunate & it was hot but that's no ones fault just a hot day. Bridgette S. was very friendly & prompt in her service!
"Nope, I'm not going to share that this is my favorite as you'll only make the line longer! Best in town!"
"Whenever we mentioned to our Lyft/Uber drivers that we had a dinner date at Pequod's Pizzeria, they all reacted with high fives and verbal approvals like ""HAIL YEAH"" or ""Nice nice nice."" This grew our hype for Pequods, and it did NOT disappoint!Note about their reservation system: It does not mean you get seated immediately. You still need to wait a bit (kind of like a FastPass system at Disneyland). Luckily, there are some cool bars around the immediate area. My wife and I ended up going to Kibbitznest across the street for a warm drink. Pequods buzzed us about 30 minutes later.The pizza is amazing! Since it takes awhile for the pizza to be ready (they were insanely packed), we ordered some chicken wings as appetizers. They were delicious. Our pizza came out about 20 minutes later, and wow. My mouth is watering just thinking about that beautiful pie. They do not mess around with toppings (we got 5, and our pizza was overflowing). The crust is cooked to perfection: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It was a glorious meal and I wish there was a Pequod's Pizzeria everywhere.Service was great, location is a bit away from downtown Chicago, and ambiance is cool. My suggestion for any first timers is to not get so many toppings on one pizza. Like I said: They do not skimp on the toppings. Two toppings would be more than enough, maybe three. But five was definitely too much and I ended up scraping off half of my toppings per slice. This is definitely a must visit for any pizza lover!"
"Being a huge fan of deep dish pizza, I was genuinely let down by the mainstream (and admittedly touristy) spots like Lou Malnati's and to a lesser extent, Giordano's. I was taken there by a friend native to Chicago against my will and I was craving something more unique afterwards. That's when I went to Pequod's Pizza. You walk inside Pequod's and you aren't greeted with the best customer service (still, the staff is pleasant) or the best atmosphere around; but you're greeted with absolutely amazing food. That's why you come here-- for the pizza. Pequod's does things a bit differently. The crust of the pizza is carmelized and has a fantastic crunch to the initial bite. The ingredients from the cheese to the meats and veggies all taste and look fresh. As with any deep-dish spot, there is the dreaded ~40 minute wait for your pizza to cook. However, Pequod's throws you a bone and offers you a free coffee, hot chocolate, or soda at the Whale Tale just steps away from the restaurant. Still, I recommend sharing a few appetizers and crisp beers to help make the wait easier.What I tried & liked:Small Deep-Dish Pizza: I topped my pizza with chicken and jalapenos and couldn't be happier. Naturally, deep-dish is extremely heavy and it's tough to get past a couple of slices (a good problem to have). But never would I imagine that the carmelized crust makes this pizza SO much better than the competition. Baking the pies in the seasoned cast-iron pans with cheese really adds a second element to the pizza missing from major chains.Things I tried & disliked:Cheesy Garlic Bread - It's your run-of-the-mill garlic bread topped with cheese. It wasn't particularly delicious and felt more like garlic bread I should receive at a dive bar. I'd recommend trying another appetizer like mozzarella sticks or onion rings-- those are difficult to get wrong.Pequod's is not in downtown-- in fact, it can be inconvenient to get here and have to head all the way back to the city. But there's a good reason why Pequod's has such a strong following, even more than that of its mainstream rivals. For what the restaurant lacks in overall polish, it more than makes up for with its unique pizza. Don't leave Chicago without trying it!"
"The pizza is worth waiting for. We made a 'priority table' request (which you have to do at least 24 hours ahead of time) as a party of 2 on a Monday night, and waited less than 20 minutes from check in. The pizza did take a while to come- about 50 Mins from when we ordered, so it's worth ordering an app. We got the fried mushrooms- they were decent and staved off the hunger until our pepperoni, mushroom, olive and basil (the fresh basil is KEY) deep dish arrived. Great pizza, and I'd wait again for it. Taking off 1 Star because 1) we were seated right next to a garbage can- like if I bent my elbow out, it would have hit the overflowing garbage can. YUCK. I get it, it's a busy place- but if there isn't space for a table, don't stick it there. And 2) the place is pretty dirty- floors needed sweeping, the table was sticky, and the booths next to our table looks pretty grimy too. Also soda water out of the tap was $2.75- for a bottle of San Pellegrino maybe, but that was one charge that surprised me, in an otherwise fairly-priced place."
"So I HATE deep dish pizza but decided to give Pequods a try since I was with a large group! It was the most amazing, most delicious pizza in the world. I would totally go back to Chicago to have this pizza!Five stars from me!!"
"It's 5'oclock somewhere. Ugh I LOVE their margarita pizza. Always crispy and yummy. Not much more to say! Quick deliveries, and always looks good when I open the box and lay my eyes on that cheesy beauty!"
A lot of hype for this place. We ordered pizza for pick up - it was ready as promised in 45 minutes. It does look like a nice place to dine in with two floors. For the pan pizza with pepperoni - 5 stars. It reminded me of when I ate with my family as a child at a Pizza Hut overseas. At the time it felt like a 5-Star pizza restaurant. Crispy caramelized crust delivers! For the thin crust cheese pizza we ordered - 2 stars. The topping sloughed off like it was a poorly homemade pizza with the premade crust.
"Chicago pizza is Pequod's.  Skip the deep dish, go for the fire pan baked garlic cheesy burnt crust. You might not be able to handle it."
"Some serious Chicago pie! Pequod's contends with best deep dish in the city and has never disappointed. The place is always packed and you will always wait 15-45 minutes, if not at the bar then standing outside. The website even says ""Priority Seating requests can be made online, by email or phone. Priority Seating Requests are NOT GUARANTEED RESERVATIONS."" So, either visit during off hours or be prepared to wait. The two-floor restaurant has a divey feel--nothing fancy about silverware or place setting-- but the food is no joke. There's not a bad pizza on the menu, but I'm partial to the pan pepperoni. The apps are just as tasty, but you'll need to save room if you want more than 1-2 slices! I love Pequod's for its quintessential Chicago-ness: sports paraphernalia, a game on tv, and some hearty 'za."
"Pequod's is my favorite, but it is definitely an acquired taste. If you're visiting Chicago, I'd definitely recommend trying Pequods and Lou Malnatis to get a few different styles of deep dish. Pequod's is a great neighborhood restaurant that's normally very busy, so expect to wait. It's worth it, and you won't find this style elsewhere."
Great People. Good tasty pie. Crust is great. My family devoured the pizza. Sauce was traditional. Topping reminded me of homemade pizza. Pizza by slice or whole pie.
"Originally when I heard about this place, it felt like people were pulling my leg.   ""Pequods"" sounded like someone was luring you into a dark alley of a bad joke.  I've had my fair share of deep dish experiences around Chicago, but this one is definitely my favorite.  Maybe because it's not as ""commercialized"" as some of the cough, cough.... other competitors, but it has a great local, lived-in feel.The other thing I liked about it is that it was a little difficult to get to.... why is this a point I like to share?  It just feels like a little ""off the beaten path"" so that it's really not intended to be a tourist trap.  It is a good 15-18min walk from the Belmont (Red/Brown/Purple Lines) CTA stop, but there is also street parking available.  I suggest the walk... since it will prepare you for the carb-loading heaving you are about to experience when you come here.We arrived early.... party of 4 with a high-chair and we got seated right away (even though there was just 2 of us of the party present).  I like that it's first-come-first-serve so that people that eat early to avoid crowds are rewarded and there's no really extensive reservation process.  We were escorted past a bar (all seats filled) of people enjoying food and beverages and a bunch of high-top tables.  We were lucky enough to get a booth and the high-chair fit perfectly on the end of the table.  You can tell the server was busy with a party of 12/mix of kids and adults that basically ""sheilded us"" off from the other part of the restaurant since they extended the booth table with long tables to accommodate the large party, but our server kept checking on us.  We put in an appetizer that arrived as the rest of our party did and we placed our pizza order right away.  Half topping large between 4 people after a sample platter of appetizers was just enough food. My only complaint is that the server that brought the pizza served us the slices so the photo op for the pizza was gone is a second.  I did what I could though.  We passed the time with beer and good company and just taking the atmosphere in.  By the time we left, the entire restaurant was full as were our stomachs.  I'd be interested to come back and try their thin crust... which a lot of tables were enjoying around us."
"Best deep dish in Chicago (or so our Chicago friends say)!! This place was absolutely delicious--the crust is perfectly caramelized, the staff is super nice and helpful, and the pizza itself was super yummy. I've heard people make a trip to Chicago just for the deep dish and I'd for sure come back for Pequods."
...it's Pequod's. It's literally the best pizza. You don't need anymore of an explanation than that. Go. Eat.
"Love this place. Has great deep dish at a really good price. Met up with a friend from the app Bumble! We had a great time and I'm so glad that me and my new friend have a go-to spot now! I highly recommend coming here, and trying out the app as well! Especially if you want to find someone new to come eat here with."
"The best pizza in Chicago, hands down.  It's always busy and the service is always slow, but it's worth it.  The pizza does have a lot of sauce, so ask for light sauce or extra-cooked."
"Oh Chicago pizza, I have heard so much about you. When an entire city is known for pizza, not just one restaurant, which one am I supposed to choose?! It's a tough decision possibly made easier by the fact that you can't go wrong.Pequod's was not what I expected at all. It was like a pub/bar feel, with small tables all over the place and just a couple of booths on the side. The menu is pretty much just pizza and a few other selections like pasta and salad. Their pizzas come in thin crust or pan pizza, and come in 10"", 12"", 16""(14"" for pan). The pan pizza also offers a personal 7"" size. Each topping is 50 cents and you can add as many as you want.The two of us ordered a small (10"") pan pizza to share and it was about the right size. We probably could have done a medium, but we would be really stuffed. Never having this deep dish of a pizza before, I wasn't expecting to be so full, but there's just so much crust and cheese that it fills you up pretty quickly.Now apparently this isn't really the deepest of deep dish, but it's still pretty deep compared to other pizzas. The crust is so crispy in the bottom and the sides of the crust have this layer of burnt cheese all the way up the sides that is just so good. The sauce and cheese are in just the right amounts to not be too saucy/cheesy, and the sausage that we got as a topping was amazing -- perfectly cooked and spiced and great with the sauce and cheese.I don't eat pizza much in general, but was really excited to try some Chicago pizza on my trip. Pequod's did not disappoint at all, and only makes me want to find some good deep dish back at home. The service is as fast as it can be (it takes close to 45 minutes ro make a pizza), and the atmosphere is fun and lively, with TV's and drinks to go around. Whether you're out of state like me or a Chicago native, definitely stop by this place and see what the hype is about!!"
"I've had mostly good experiences here. They're not located downtown, so they get lost in the Chicago saturation of Giordano's and Lou's and aren't famous with or necessarily sought out by tourists, which is honestly great. That being said, they are still busy AF, but there's definitely a sweet spot in terms of arrival time. I've brought Brits, Icelanders, and Russians here and all of them had their minds blown. The Russian tried to order a salad, but we threatened him with harm and he came around. Anyways, the food. The pizza is amazing. I'm not sure from where they source their sauce, but it's deliciously tomato-ey with the perfect amount of acidity and seasoning that stands out we'll all against the rafts of cheese and toppings. The crust is what everyone talks about though, so on to that. It's more pillowy than Giordano's, which is good in its own right. G's is a crisper, more buttery crust and is LOADED with toppings. P's definitely privileges the crust experience as they sprinkle it with cheese on the outside which forms a crunchy, crusty exterior. The crust-to-toppings-and-sauce at P's definitely favors the much thicker crust, so if you're into bread this is your pizza. I had a slightly negative experience when I had family come visit recently, but it was largely rectified. We had two small children with us, so I called them, understanding their reservation policy is really just sort of a 1/2 line-skipper policy and asked when to come in. We were told 5:00 was good so we did that. We showed up on time and proceeded to wait our 30 minutes we were told about. Came and went, waited 10 additional minutes. Went and talked to hostess and she said they were getting our table ready. 10 more minutes went by (50 minutes total for us public school kids) and I'm nine months pregnant with two insane 3 year olds so I saunter up there looking fat and hungry and am told just a few more minutes. I tell my family I'm pretty pissed since we came when we were told to come and we're still waiting at an hour; they still want to wait it out. I speak to a manager. Apparently the long wait was because the hostess seated another party that just waltzed in unannounced at our table and there wasn't another one available for a bit but he would ""take care"" of us. We were eventually seated around the 1.25 hour mark. The manager took our order while we were waiting and our pizza showed up shortly after we sat down. We got comped a pitcher of 3 Floyds, which was really nice, so all in all it evened out in the end in terms of pizza arrival time vs. wait time! They definitely screwed up, but owned up to it and fixed it as best as they could. Good job Pequods."
"3 hour waits on the weekends during prime time but duhh it's because it's the best pizza EVER!  The carmelized crust is just everything. I feel like I just put up with eating the pizza portion just to get to the crust.  Pro tip: If you get pepperoni, dont get it with any other toppings because other toppings will make it watery.   I've tried it with mushrooms, onions, sausage..just plain pepperoni is the best!"
"Holy macaroni....before I begin, let me just state that I don't like cheese. The only time I tolerate cheese, maybe even enjoy it a little is when it's a light amount on a hot out of the oven pizza. I never in a million years thought I would ever crave, let alone LIKE a deep dish pizza because of the amount of cheese. I now stand corrected. My favorite pizzas are Round Table in Redding, CA, Regina's in North End Boston and Juliana's in Brooklyn. But now ""PeePots"" is my new number 1. PERFECT crust with lacy edges, AMAZING sauce they should jar and sell, DELICIOUS stringy chewy cheese to hold it all together, spicy thin pepperoni with burnt edges....my mouth is watering and I just ate it 8 hours ago. I just might have to stop by again before we leave Chicago....1,000% worth the wait!"
"I've been a pizza fanatic my entire life and, WOW, this is the best pizza I have ever eaten! (no joke!)...  I will most definitely be back here next time I am in Chicago.  I love that they are open late, it's easy to park, the food here is delicious and reasonably priced. The environment is cool and laid-back...  What isn't to love??  This is officially my new favorite pizza place in the world! :)"
"Good pizza, the caramelized crust is very tasty. Tho the toppings are very expensive. Especially when they don't have options that includes toppings like any other pizza place."
Love the unique take on Chicago Style. Long wait but worth it!
"Open late- wait was as expected for a deep pan pizza. We love Chicago-style but hadn't had it quite like this, the dough was crunchy! Which can be a good thing but this was a bit much- at least an inch of it made it a bit too dry. The caramelized edges were the best part! Service was good, but the whole place has a dive-bar vibe."
"Not quite traditional Chicago deep dish, but Pequods never fails to deliver. If you are willing to wait for a table or extra long delivery times, it will def be worth every bite once you sink your teeth into the crunchy crust!"
Its like they say Best Pizza In Chi-LandWould say its Deep Dish is very different from the rest! Love the caramelized crust. Thinking of it it's making me hungry a little right now!Got some salad while waiting and would say we the pizza did not take too long.Definitely got lucky with seating would recommend making a reservation. We didn't but it was pack after we came in.
"Take it from a New Yorker who's never really enjoyed deep dish, this place deep dish was the best thing I've ever had! Went into Pequod's on a friends tip and trusted the instinct to go here. I went in on a Thursday around 2PM and there no wait for 4 which was great, pizza wait was about 20 minutes which is the usual wait and when It did come It was amazing!! The cheese cause ratio was just right! The sauce was super flavorful and the cheese was great cheesy goodness. The crust was perfectly baked and a bit crunch around the edges which made the pit even better. If you have sometime and want to enjoy some great deep dish definitely stop by!"
"Still dreaming about this pizza. We got a large sausage pan pie and it was amazing - they definitely have the best crust! The staff was super friendly and the music was A+. The pizza does take about 45 minutes to cook so we got some garlic bread and onion rings as apps, which were pretty standard."
"As good as the others have said.  I'm a big fan of Chicago pizza and was only in town for one evening with the family.  We had a couple of Chicago newbs with us, so I really wanted to show off the pie.  Never had Pequod's before, and I lean towards Giordano's.  But it was a holiday weekend and I didn't want to tempt the crowds, so this place was close and we gave it a try.Even ordering carry out was a challenge.  The place was packed!  Took 10 minutes to get through the door to the bar to place an order.  Found a couple leaving their bar stools, so we were able to sit and enjoy a couple of craft brews while the pizza took its 60 minute journey through the kitchen.  When we got the pies home, they were just outstanding.  Had an all meat one and an all veggie one.  Both had ample toppings, plenty of cheese, and a very tasty red sauce.  I would come back again in a heart beat."
"It had been so many years since I was at this location and, wow, what a change in crowd! I mean, still a young crowd but we got older, but it was never nearly as packed back in the day as it was this week. What a crowd! We called ahead and got priority on the seating list and that made a big difference, but we were fortunate enough to immediately get two seats at the bar and get served quickly and place our order quickly with a great bartender.Our salad and appetizer came super quickly which made the wait for our ever delicious Pequod's Pizza a little easier. I didn't want an iceberg and romaine mix and the bartender was happy to have spinach swapped out for my side salad order. Very accommodating.Our classic, deep dish Pequod's pie came within about 30 to 45 minutes, piping hot. Delicious as always! Caramelized rim of the crust and top as always!I'm so used to going to the Morton Grove location, which I love, yet I was not disappointed in coming to the Clybourn location!"
"We really enjoyed Pequod's - I think it's the best deep dish that I've had in Chicago.Of course they have the ridiculous caramelized crust.... which is one of the main attractions. The sauce is very fresh and great, a touch too sweet - cheese is perfect. The start of the show -  the toppings are on point - pepperoni, onion and giardiniera is the way to go. I'm salivating  all over the keyboard. Great beer selection at a reasonable price."
"Pequods...be still my heart. Your deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza is what pizza dreams are made of. Your crust perfectly crunchy on the bottom yet soft and so light. Your sauce deliciously zesty and full of flavor. Your cheese nicely crisped on the edges and melted perfectly on top. And your sausage and pepperoni (and I typically don't like pepperoni)...goodness it's all too tasty. I've had the other Chicago deep dishes and they've got nothing on you. Not their crusts, not their sauces, and not their toppings. I shall dream of you til we meet again."
"If you can make it over here, GET YOUR DEEP DISH HERE!I've been here twice now, and I have really enjoyed it each time.The atmosphere is relaxed, and very sports-bar-like, with TVs dotted around space. They have a second floor with more seating, but as a whole, the place does not have the most seating. I've heard of people have to wait for hours on weekends.I've only been here on weekdays for dinner, and I have never had to wait.I've come with a larger group, and we do call ahead.As for food, two large pizzas is perfect for eight people. And don't forget to add a couple beers! Alogether, two large pizzas and two pitchers of beer ended up being 16.44. Great value for money!And honestly, best deep dish. The cheese to crust to topping ratio is very even. The crust is cook slightly over so that it is cheesy and crisp on the outside. So. GOOD!And the waiters have always been very helpful in helping us decide what to order, and are very attentive to our drinks situation.If you are going to get deep dish, come here!"
"Pizza was amazing!! highly recommend!!  appetizers were just average. we got there and they told us we would have to wait an hour and a half for a table, only waited 50 minutes, but it was strange when we went to the hostess initially, she told us to come back in 45 minutes for a pager since they had run out. get more pagers maybe??? i'm sure this is not the first time that happened. i feel like if i wouldn't have gone up to get the pager sooner we would've missed out on our table if we weren't standing inside waiting, while most people did stand out in the cold. they took 3 groups of us upstairs & seated a couple that came AFTER us, before us, incredibly annoying. our waitress was just ok, she a different tables appetizers down on our table then once she realized she picked them up and placed them on their table and it took her 25 minutes after our pizza came to come to us and ask if everything was okay. i would carry out instead of dine in, next time."
"The best pizza, it's always full, wait is long but worth it! Good vibes, good service."
One of my first Chicago deep dish experiences. Saw this place on the Food Network. It was pretty good. Not quite mind blowing like they showed on TV. Really crowded. Looking forward to trying a couple of other places
"I was suggested by many for a true Chicagoan pizza experience and was not disappointed. I suggest going on a week day, I went on a week day morning and a wait time was nonexistent, however you will wait 30-40 min for your pizza regardless because it takes time for the dough to finish cooking. Onwards to the pizza! The sauce was evenly spread, plentiful, and danced with the spices and herbs while the cheese melted in the gooey, savory masterpiece harmonizing with the scrumptious toppings instead of simply laying on top. I was impressed, and although I am not a fan of the deep dish, I know pizza lovers will continue to flock and fraternize. I highly recommend the garlic bread, I can't begin to describe how heavenly it was."
This place is hands down the best deep dish pizza in the city in my opinion.  Who doesn't love a cripsy cheese crust?It gets really busy on game nights.  If you go on a Friday make sure you go early.  The best time to visit without a wait is to come during the weekday or during the day on a Saturday or Sunday.
Oh my gosh Thick and good I'm outside of Atlanta currently living Therefore challenged in the quality pizza areaThe large will keep 2 ppl fed for 2 days.Loud and exciting Great locationGlad we walked 2 miles home after consuming Had to wait an hour for the pizza yet worth it.
Must try deep dish pizza! The dough is super soft with a caramelized crust. I haven't been to many places but it was well worth the wait. The appetizer combos and wings were just as good. We got two mediums which was more than enough for 6 people.
"Pequod's is the best deep dish there is in Chicago. I can't count the number of high fives I got when I mentioned it as my favorite deep dish to foodie insiders. I took my boyfriend there this past weekend, he never had the sweet goodness of Chicago deep dish. The look of sheer joy and satisfaction on his face after taking a few bites said it all. The atmosphere was quiet on a Monday afternoon. The service was attentive, our server kept refilling our beverages and would check on us every so often. We were also impressed when she suggested we saved the ranch from our wings to dip our pizza, that is the type of thinking we appreciate. We had deep dish pizza with pepperoni and fresh garlic, we ordered buffalo wings before the pizza, there was a 20 minute wait for pizza, and we were starving. Be prepared on busier days the wait is longer 40 minutes or so. The pizza is phenomenal, the crust is crispy and buttery, the cheese, sauce and dough form a gooey paradise in your mouth. We left beyond full and headed to the airport and did not regret one bit of it."
"The pizza was great, but the wait time was not. As to be expected with deep dish, the pizza took about 45 minutes. But when you take into account the amount of time it takes to be seated, etc. plan for at least an hour and a half before you will eat. Don't go starving. Also, do not go with a large group. We went with a group of 9 and were squeezed into a table that should fit 5-6. All in all, the food was wonderful, but the location is tiny."
One of the best pizza places to eat in chicago. The crust is a good amount of crispy and tastes really good (even though it looks burnt its not). It is a long wait to eat there but its definitely worth the wait!!
"This place is amazing! My kids love it and I do too! We always order the pan pizza with extra caramelization sauce, sausage and pepperoni. WE LOVE IT!"
"Got here at 8pm on Wednesday night and there wasn't a wait. We ordered some fries and the single for 2 and it was more than enough of food. Be aware that it does take 30-40 minutes for the pizza to come. I was really hungry, so the fries were perfect to hold me over.Pizza- it was pretty good, as we ordered pepperoni and sausage for our toppings. It's greasier and messier than Lou malnatis, and they burnt the edges of the crust for a crispier flavor (not sure if that was intentional or not). We split the small 10"" between 2 people and it's more than enough food. Don't order more than that or you're going to end up with a ton of leftoversService was good and it has more of a local atmosphere (compared to Lou's where it just felt like a touristy restaurant). Liked the bar ambiance and being able to watch the bulls and cubs games. Great value. Paid less than $20 for the whole dinner. Overall, the food is excellent, but it's not going to blow your mind. I see the appeal of Pequod's being a local favorite."
"TL,DR - LONG wait line 1-2Hrs  (and 45 mins after ordering) Therese a reason why Chicago raves about pequad's they definitely know their pizza. I suggest a Pan Pizza and an appetizer while you wait. im not a Chicago native but will return here again, and gladly wait in line to grab a pizza. This place changed my thoughts on deep dish.I was on the fence about deep dish pizza as it always seemed like it would be a heavy meal, and it is. Its only good depending on who makes it.My gf decided i needed to try Pequod's while visiting Chicago. Gotta say, this place def changed my mind about deep dish. Wait time- Excessively long during nights, you may be looking upwards of 1-2 hour wait and another 45 mins before you get your food after placing the order. Interior - There is a downstairs area and a second floor as well. Downstairs seems a bit more crowded but has a larger bar. There is more room for tables and larger parties upstairs with a smaller bar. Just depends on preference. The place feels welcoming with a good down to earth and sports bar vibe.. dimly lit and plenty of screens to watch the game.We ended up getting a smaller pizza as there was 2 of us, this was recommended  by the waitress. We also ordered cheese bread which was to die for (or i think i was just starving) if youre impatient i suggest getting an appetizer. 1 Pan pizza - 3 toppings (Jalapeno, Pepperoni & Mushrooms) Ive seen deepdish before and what always turned me away was how greasy and runny the pizza would be. Pequad's was not the case! their pizza crust was crispy and held up quite nicely my fav by far. The sauce and toppings were not greasy or oily at all. I finished half the pizza (2 slices) before tapping out."
"Excellent food!  We went for lunch and were excited to see the lunch special, 7in pan pizza for $4.95.  We started with the bruschetta which by presentation didn't look appealing, but the toast was garlic and buttery and the tomato relish was spot on.  Not a traditional brushchetta, but I would definitely order again.  I had the 7in pan cheese pizza and it was fantastic!  The sauce, crust and cheese were flavorful and unique.  My friend had the beef sandwich which she said was delicious.  Service was great and environment chill.  We will be back"
"Pequod's was recommended to us by locals as one of the best deep dish pizza places in Chicago. Pizzas are outstanding! Wait at the door is ~30min, pizza preparation time is ~40min, so make sure you got plenty time in hand when visiting. We ordered 2 medium size deep dish pizzas and few salads for a group of 6 people and it was just right!"
"I really liked this pizza. Pepperoni, sausage, sauce and crust were all delicious. The cheese that melts and burns on the edge of the pan and pizza is heaven. I had the personal pizza and I'm stuffed. Give yourself ample time to wait in line to be seated. Also to wait for the pizza to be made which usually takes 45-60 minutes."
"deeee-lish deep dish! Pequod's was my welcome food to Chicago, and after having tried two others after, this is still on the top of my list. My cousins recommended this place, and it's easy to see why they rave over the deep dish pizza here- served in a cast iron skillet, with a burnt edge crust (just the top, really), they get the pizza right. Down to the sauce, the amount of cheese, and toppings- I'm drooling just writing about this! We were able to choose a half and half option, which was awesome! We went with spinach, mushrooms, and sausage for one half and pepperoni, garlic, and basil with the other half. Coupled with a pitcher of beer, this was the perfect afternoon! The pizza was finished, and now I'm wishing I was back in Chicago for more. Definitely would return!"
"Visiting Chicago... and why not check out the best foods this city has to offer! Voted #1 pizza... well there is a reason why it was labeled #1 on multiple lists. The pan pizza is amazing!!! I went with a medium pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, olives, extra sauce... and all well done. At first glance... mouth was watering... but it wasn't until that first bite, that I had that Disney Ratatouille moment. Every single flavor separate from the others, yet satisfyingly delicious. I'm glad I was able to make it here."
"Pequod's is now the 5th Chicago deep dish pizza joint I've tried in the past year. Though I'm by no means a die-hard deep dish fan, I still rather liked Pequod's and think it's my 2nd favorite deep dish (to find out which one is my fav, check out my other reviews ;))So what's good?- the SAUCE. I think it's one of my favs- generous toppings. when they give sausage, they give LOTS of sausage.- the giardiniera topping - YUMNow for the bad..- the thick crust. I get that there must be thick crust so all the toppings, cheese, and sauce are held together... but I just thought there was too much dough- I came a weds for lunch, so there was no wait (aside from the 45 mins for the pizza), but I imagine weekends to be a different story- it's not very cheap. it turned out to be $20/pp including drinks + tip + tax"
"I've been to a couple of different joints for deep dish and never quite cared enough but this though is a different league. The sauce was amazing though a little too wet to make eating not too messy. The cheesy garlic bread was great too. The crust was part cheese, adding to the flavour. Service? It was great. Our server checked in with my friend about the definitely drunk group next to us just to make sure everything was a-ok. It's rare that restaurants care if your neighbours are nice or not.My only unhappiness is that I've to wait to order my pizza. Guess I've been spoilt by how Lou Malnati let's you order them while waiting for a table."
"Loved this place! The atmosphere was very laid back, the service was friendly, and the pizza amazing. Chicago style deep dish done perfectly."
That burnt crust is legit the best thing to happen to deep dish pizza. Real deal Chicagoans eat here.
Ugh pizza here is super good! Crust is amazing!!! Laid back spot to have some pizza and drinks with your friends!! Or to watch a sports event! Something different and they have a lot of options of appetizers :)
"Not a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza, but this place changed my mind.  Sometimes ill find myself craving the delicious caramelized crust pizza.  We usually tell our waiter/waitress to keep it in the oven for a little longer.  What I love about peaquods is the crust never gets soggy.  Its the right amount of sauce and generous toppings + its not overly cheesy like other places in the city. The wait is definitely worth it and the pizza tastes just as amazing the next day for left overs :) !!"
Dine in only. Take out or delivery is awful. This place is typical bar and pizza. However the pizza is the best deep dish there is. A true Chicago classic that you need to check out. Better than lous and way better than giordanos IMO. full disclosure have not tried Chicago pizza oven grinder.
"Great tasting sauce and amazing pull from cheese. All pizza is build your own and the are not stingy with the ingredients. This place is family approved!! Although, I wouldn't compare it Lou's because I remember Lou from my meat eating days but I heard they had great sausage as well. You can't beat the Lunch Deals either."
"I was in Chicago for a visit and there were some tourist things I wanted to do like try deep dish pizza. However, I did want to do some research so I could at least try what many consider to be the best. Yes, there are other places that are considered to be the go to.But when I spoke with the Chicago locals, this place is the only place to go to for deep dish. I unfortunately can not speak too much for the place itself as far as ambience, atmosphere, service etc as I got an order to go. However, it did seem like a cozy joint to have some good pizza and have a good time. I ordered my deep dish over the phone and put like a million toppings so it came out to be about 30 bucks or so, but it was totally worth it. Even a day later, the leftovers were delicious. I love this place and can't wait to be back."
"The food was awesome and our waitress, Noel, was even better.  The hostess Brenda, however, was the worst hostess ever.  We were starving and asked about ordering a large pan pizza while we waited to be seated so we wouldn't have to wait much longer to eat after being seated.  She said that it couldn't be done until we were seated.  After finally being seated, we asked to place the order for our pizza while our waitress became unoccupied due to the lack of waitresses to help her, but the miserable Brenda now said that we had to wait for our waitress.  Praise Noel!Get rid of Brenda or teach her some manners!"
"While they do get busy on the weekends, I have always had a good experience here. Head nextdoor to their bar for drinks and snacks while you wait to be seated in the restaurant. The pizza here is some of Chicago best and I always love their salad too. They do they're best to crank out deep dish pizza as fast as they could. I love that they are always clear and right on with their wait and pizza cooking times so that there is no confusion. It's definitely worth the wait. I recommend pepperoni and sausage in my pizza!"
"As a tourist from California, I came to Chicago to venture out deep dish pizza joints. After further research, I have concluded four original deep dish pizza from Chicago; Lou Manati, Uno, Pequods and Giordanos. See my other reviews of the other three and their respective ranking of the four godfathers of ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza"". I will not grade on the service due to the fact that they were take outs + eaten within 20 minutes. Here is my take on Pequod;At $28, they were just a bit more pricey for aSmall size deep dish. Pizza: custom, all meat pizza The crust: solid, burnt but still had flavorSauce: Just about right Meat: all the meat literally was filling. The roast beef meat was the best! They did not cheap out Cheese: melted, okayAtmosphere: great for ages 20-35 crowd, nice ambience Parking: located further away from downtown, but yet close enough. Overall: I would have to rank Pequod second out of the four godfathers of ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza"" places. Pros: the area is great, parking shouldn't be an issue. LOTS OF MEAT!Cons: could be more cheesy and less burnt crusts. Also if they could have a normal menu rather than a custom menuGrade: B"
"Not sure what all the hubbub is about.  It's usually at least an hour wait, and the pizza is good but not THAT good.  There are lots of pizza joints in Chicago, I can't say that this one is definitively the best"
"In the top 3 deep dish pizza spots in Chicago, hands down. Caramelized crust is delicious! Anytime someone visits from out of town, I take them here. Prepare to be full."
It was good times. I didn't have their famous pizza. I ordered an Italian beef sandwich and fries it was good. I like my Portillo's Italian beef more but it was fine. I like that their sandwich comes with a side of gravy because it taste better dipped.
Made a reservation because there seems to always be a long wait. We arrived and still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. My friend and I shared a small DD. It took about 50 minutes to arrive at the table. The pizza was good; heavy on the sauce and the cheese are was bit spread out. Enjoyed the copious amounts of toppings! Service was friendly. I give it 4 stars because we were seated right next to a garbage can which was kind of gross.
"The wait was worth it!   (It was only about 15 mins on a Friday afternoon around 2:00 pm)  It's wheelchair accessible, if you let them know and the pizza is good!  I got a personal pan with a couple toppings and it was good!  It's does have a thick crust but you don't really even notice.  It has a great balance of crust, sauce and cheese.  Very good!"
"As a New Yorker. I take pride in my hometown pizza. I'm no brat about it, but at the same time. Deep dish pizza is not pizza. As one friend put it, it's bread lasagna.However, I do like my deep dish pizza. So on my first visit to the windy city, I was told this was the best place for deep dish.My friend and I split a small, half regular, half sausage & onion. Boy howdy does this stuff fill you up! Every bite makes you want to take another one. Pequods is certainly the king of deep dish pizza in Chicago!If you ever pass thru this city, I'd absolutely check it out. You won't be disappointed"
"Came here saturday night around 6 PM and this place was paaaacked. Wait to dine in was an hour and then another 1.5 hour for your pizza to be made. We made an executive decision to carry out so we could eat faster heheWe ordered a small with mushrooms and then went across the street to Kibbitznest (which you should totally do if you have a long wait because that place is awesome).It took a little longer than what they quoted us so when we went back they surprised us with a large pizza woooooop Took it home and devoured it. Personally i'm a thin crust fan (east coast represent) so I'm generally suspicious of deep dish. But I was surprised they actually had a decent amount of sauce unlike other deep dish I've had. Mushrooms were really good and the cheese crust was phenomenal. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was how dry the bread is. But all in all, would come back for this lunch special I hear so much about."
Okay so this isn't my personal favorite place for deep dish but I do find myself coming here often bc it's where my husband likes to bring our out of town guests for deep dish. The crust here is more caramelized which I like but I don't consider this fully deep dish. It's really good though so I'd recommend!
"Great pizza, just don't love the burnt crust."
I brought 2 of my friends to Pequod's on a Saturday around 2pm after my fiancé told me that they serve some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. It was super packed but the hostess was very efficient. We ended up waiting for about 10 minutes at the bar until our table was ready. We ordered a deep dish pizza (idr what size or type lol it's been a month) but I do know that it was pretty delicious. Our waitress was really nice and the place felt like a 70s pizza parlor lol. I like it a lot and will be back one day when I feel like waiting for great deep dish.
"This was the best pizza place I've been to in Chicago. We went on Mother's Day around noon and was able to sit without waiting! I heard the lines get insanely long so we were super lucky. We ordered a small and medium for 4 people and it was more than enough. We had leftovers. For the pan pizzas, we ordered sausage, meatballs, and jalapeños for one and onion, pepperoni, mushroom, and onions for the other. Both were sooo good. Will miss this place!"
Was in Chicago recently and of course had to get deep dish pizza.  I had read a lot of articles about Pequod's being the best and were they right! I was scared we woukd have to wait a long time as it was. Thursday night but we got seated after 15 mins.My boyfriend and I ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza and boy was it delicious.  The crust is caramelized and has a little bit of a crunch too it.  Full of flavor and they don't skimp out on the toppings.  I was full after just once slice but it was too food so ate another.Would recommend over Giordanos and Lou Malnatis. It is the best deep dish I've ever had!
"Hands down the best pizza I have ever had, and I have had tons of pizza. I looked forward to coming here after seeing the restaurant featured on countless tv shows. The caramelized cheese crust is to die for. I could eat just the crust and be satisfied. The pie as a whole has a great balance of crust, cheese and toppings. The sauce is delicious and I love that they are open late. There was no wait when I visited around 11pm."
"Service was great. Food was great. Definantly a place to go for great pizza !!!! I got a personal deep dish lunch special, it was amazingly delicious."
"We had to come taste the hype!! This place did NOT disappoint!!! The crust was not super thick which is a good thing for us , the sauce was very flavorful, just the right amount of cheese with just the right amount of toppings! Our server Sinai C was excellent!!! This is a must if in the area!!!"
After seeing all the rave I had to try. Sat at the bar upstairs...no fancy by any means but I'm there for pizza.Staff was crazy busy yet friendly.  My pan pizza was delicious.  The crust is not doughy or overly thick.  The burnt cheese edges are heaven. The days could be thicker for me but I ate it all and would go it again
"Since this place is right by the theatre we went there to grab food before our movie. The food was amazing!! I'm definitely not a deep dish person, like I eat it but it's not something I love or crave. But after I had their cheese deep dish pizza I fell in love I've literally been thinking about going back since then. This is now my favorite deep dish place. The service was also really good. The only suggestion would be to keep the place a bit more cleaner? Saw some random paper pieces on the floor."
"I totally understand why so many reviews and why so many great reviews.  The Chicago Deep Dish Pizza here is amazing.  They put a ton, and I do mean a TON of high quality toppings on this pizza.  The sausage chunks were like miniature boulders.  I love when a restaurant endeavors to do nothing but the best and at a great consumer value.  This will be a repeat destination on my journeys to Chicago."
Amazing stuffed crust pizza. I was told this is where the locals eat. Place is small but they have a hard working and friendly staff. Had pan pizza sausage and mushroom. Would definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago.
"This pizza is fantastic! We were seated very quickly given the size of the room in the place. Seating downstairs is a little cramped. My one complain was how hot it was in the room. This was my only time here so it could have been a night where the AC was malfunctioning. When ordering a pizza, they let you know in advance to expect at least a 30 minutes wait time!"
"Pequod's is consistently my favorite pizza in Chicago. Their pan pizza, while not typical ""Chicago-style,"" is sheer perfection. The sauce is tangy and delicious however the real show stopper is the cheesy crust. Pequod's lives up to the hype."
"I was born and raised in Chicago and pride myself on knowing good pizza. I want to give this place 5 stars but I have had better so it wouldn't be fair. We had the pan pizza and our fav part is definitely the caramelized cheese edges, although one side was more burnt than caramelized. The bottom part of the crust was nice and crispy but the middle was on the doughy side. The sauce and sausage is a good flavor. We opted for green peppers as well. The size of the peppers were very random. A couple of huge pieces mixed with some smaller diced pieces. A more uniformed piece would add a consistent flavor and texture. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. It's a small place with exposed brick. Definitely busy and a little on the crammed side so it's loud. I would definitely recommend this place. I really want to give this place 5 stars. Perhaps our next visit will yield a more evenly cooked pizza."
Among the best.  You must like dough to enjoy the pizza because it is thick and crispy at the same time.  Not too much cheese which lightens it a bit.
"The wait for this place was craaazzzyyyy. But not crazy enough for me not to give it 5 Stars. This was on our list of places to visit during our weekend in Chicago, and it did not disappoint. Medium pizza is more than enough for two people, and it was definitely all it was hyped up to be. You get to pick your own toppings either full or half, which is convenient when sharing. Staff was friendly and attentive. I would recommend everyone to go here at least once."
Sooooooo good. I say this place is a must try when in Chicago! The caramelized crust was awesome and it hit the spot just right.We didn't order anything else except our deep dish and patiently waited till it came out. I recommend coming here hungry and patient. We got lucky and got seated right away but usually it gets busy with a wait. WORTH A TRY! Everyone ends up picking their favorite though depending on their different taste.
Are u kidding me? The best pan pizza on earth hands down!!!! Parking sux but what ya you gonna do.
"If you woke up this morning and were like, ""Dang, I wish someone on the internet would tell me where I could get the best pizza in the world from,"" good news - I'm here!Pequod's is amazing. The pizza, the crust, the toppings, the atmosphere. I love it all. I especially recommend going with children because they will think that the caramelized cheese around the rim of the baking dish is ""burnt"" and will give it to you and your mouth and face will rejoice. There is quite a wait here (or has been every time I've gone there) but the good news is that there's an overflow bar next door where you can sit and enjoy a free non-alcoholic beverage. Good thinking, pizza people!"
"At the end of my second and final full day in the Windy City, I am reflecting back on my dining experiences in the last 48 hours. I knew before coming that I wanted to be super touristy and try at least one deep dish pizzeria.  Asking for recommendations, I was told about 2 places: Giordano's and Pequod's.  Being the gluttonous Texan and street food connoisseur that I am, I said to myself, ""This seems like a good excuse to eat pizza 2 days in a row!""  So naturally, I had Giordano's yesterday and Pequod's today.Listen to me carefully: Giordano' is milquetoast, moderately halfway decent pizza.  Pequod's on the other hand, is a divine medley of sauce, toppings, and a metric ton of melted cheese practically bursting out of the buttery, garlicky caramelized crust that so precariously holds it all together.  Holy hell is this good pizza.  I ordered the same thing at both establishments--personal pizza with pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, and pineapple (shut up, it's meant to be, and you know it)--and Pequod's just absolutely blew Giordano's out of the water for the same price point.  Everything from the ambience to the friendliness of the staff to the quality of the food was just way better.Pequod's, thank you for putting your goods in my mouth."
One of the best pizza's in Chicago! Its definitely  a must! The crust is the best part. My personal go to is : Italian sausage with giardinera extra well done. There is usually a wait but that is expected - especially on weekends. Delivery is also an option - totally worth waiting.
"The absolute best meatball sub ever invented. Somewhat impossibly, it's even better than their pizza. Been going here for years."
"Of all the Chicago pizzerias I would say Pequods is definitely top 5! If you want to try them during their non busy times, go during their weekday lunch special!! It's $5 for a personal pizza with 1 topping and a drink. What a steal! So far I've had their:- pan pizza with sausage - pan pizza with pepperoni - appetizer plattter (mozz sticks, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, jalapeño poppers)- wings I like their fried mushroom and the pan pizza with sausage. The only reason I didn't give them a 5/5 is because as a native Chicagoan, I assumed it was deep dish, maybe it isnt and really is a pan pizza? There's more dough than cheese, sauce, and toppings. But as a PAN PIZZA, it's good and has a tasty crust"
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, IMO!! I always recommend eating here over Giordano's and Lou Malnati's to out-of-town friends. Everything about Pequod's is significantly better, especially the fact that their crust is seasoned so you're not just eating unflavored cardboard like the other restaurants. Definitely recommend eating here if you're looking for deep dish."
"They hardly need another review from me, but if you're looking for deep dish in Chicago, this is definitely one of the top two. The wait is usually on the longer side, but grab an appetizer and a beer and it'll be more than worth it."
My first deep dish experience and thank goodness I went to Pequod's! WOW! It's definitely worth the 40 min wait to get your piping hot pie customed to perfection! The lunch deal made it suuuper cheap! I added additional toppings and a salad as well. The crunchy cheese on the sides made the pizza superb. A meal I won't forget!
"I wouldn't call myself a deep dish connoisseur but I've tried my fair share of deep dish chains and pequods is by far the best. That being said, i think many people agree with me and I've always had a long wait (1-2 hours). The bar next door, whale tale, is the perfect place to wait for your table-you can enjoy apps and drinks while you wait too! Once you're seated you normally wait 45-60 mins for deep dish to be made so i recommend getting an appetizer sometime in the process if you're really hungry. But don't worry, the wait will be worth it! The pizza is EXCELLENT. I would say the service is so-so but considering they're always packed, I get it. I try to come here as much as I can when i come to Chicago!"
"I think I have found my favorite Chicago deep dish. I am not a native of Chicago and my list of deep dishExperiences are not intense but I have tried a few and this pizza is at the top of my list. Bar like atmosphere equipped with radio and sports playing on TV's. However, it also has an intimate vibe with the variety of guests (families, bar patrons, all ages, etc) and the warm service from the waitresses. You can tell the bar is a staple in the area.Pizza is mostly crust but the crust has a great airy texture. Cheese and toppings are still the main attraction and they are generous with the toppings. Tomato sauce is fresh and you can see traces of actual vegetables in the sauce (my fav). Best crust I have ever had on a deep dish- bye bye to regular butter crust! Loved my visit, wish there were more locations!"
Line was crazy long. Pizza looked amazing. 40 minutes wait even for take out. We left and went somewhere else. We will be back and try again but since so many people were there and waiting outside...
"Pequod offers a hybrid type Chicago style deep dish pizza, the pizza is more of a really thick pan pizza than the traditional deep dish. They are also famous for laying cheese all the way over the crust so you get that really crispy burnt cheesy crust on the edge which is amazing! We had both the Lou malnati and pequod back to back within the two days Chicago trip and comparing the two, pequod is a more hearty and rustic. All in all it's a must visit spot in Chicago."
"Delicious pizza, less cheese than the usual Chicago deep dish pizzas. We got a deep dish green pepper, onion and of course gardiniera which is always an essential when you eat pizza. Pizza took about 50 minutes and came out piping hot just like I love it. Will definitely be back soon."
"Amazing deep-dish pizza! The caramelized crust is perfect! The pizza itself is not too cheesy and baked to perfection. We ordered a large pizza for 4 people and it was more than enough, I would recommend skipping out on any appetizers just to make sure you have enough for 1-2 slices. The service is phenomenal and the wait time is reasonable (15-20 to get seated and 50 minutes for the pizza). It's a little out of the way but definitely worth the drive."
"We spent the weekend in Chicago in from South Florida and figured we would need to find the best deep dish pizza while we were there. We came to Pequod's as we had multiple friends from the Chicago area recommend this as the best Chicago pizza. We came after Cubs game and were quite hungry. I was impressed as to how inexpensive the pizza was, we ordered one large pizza and between three of us we only finished about half. The pizza was brought to us in a cast iron pan,And it had a nice caramelized crust. The main reason that I would not choose this location as the best deep dish pizza in Chicago is due to the fact that probably 75% of the pizza was due and the other 25% was toppings and sauce versus other locations which had significantly more toppings and sauce. The pizza was still very enjoyable. If I am ever back in Chicago, I will most likely choose Giordanno's or Lou Malnatti's over Pequod's."
"I've ordered from them a few times, and I like the ""caramelized crust"" they are known for - but in general, I think the crust is too much bread.  It still all tastes good & you can tell they use good quality ingredients, but I'd only get it if my friends want this one in particular these days."
Love this place. True to Burt's original recipe (from the original Morton Grove location)
"In the ongoing battle of the best Chicago deep dish, I made my way over to Pequod's on a recent trip.What I like about this place is it's not located in the middle of the The Loop tourist trap. You get to see more of Chicago as you trek out here.The restaurant is simple and to the point. It's set up like a classic pizzeria with small tables scattered about and condiments on the table. Read the menu immediately upon sitting as the servers are quick to  take your order since the pizza takes quite a while to cook. I went with a pepperoni deep dish pizza.The pizza was very good, but honestly not as good as I was expecting. Flavors were good so was the sauce, but I have to say that I think Lou Malnati's is better. None the less, I plowed through as much of the pizza as possible and left there full and satisfied. Great pizza, but in my opinion, not the champion of Chicago deep dish. Still Lou Malnatis."
"1/2/2018Came in from LA decided to do my typical foodie run and try a bunch of different Chicago specialties including PizzaAfter sampling Pequads Malnatis and Giordanos The winner is PequadsThe crust is super thick toppings are excellent I love the char around the edges just a great pizza overallPhoto of Pequod's Pizzeria - Chicago, IL, United States"
Nice location and very busy when we went. But they were able to accommodate us in a reasonable amount of time. They were able to seat us upstairs. Pizza was bready with a good amount of tomato sauce. Gave it 4 stars considering we were able to experience Chi-Town pizza there.
"This place was awesome! If you are looking for some great deep dish pizza, check them out!"
"Delicious pizza. The crust isn't soggy in the least bit, they caramelize it and it adds a nice contrast to the rich flavor of the cheese and sauce."
"Definitely worth the wait (for a table and the wait for the pizza to cook). It's different than the traditional Chicago deep dish, but in the best way possible. It has a caramelized crust and a pan, thick crust pizza. I don't know how they make the crust thick AND crispy, but they have. Note that a medium pizza is a MEDIUM pizza, and if there are just two of you, you should probably plan on leftovers or order a small. Waiting tip: the buzzer works in the bar two doors down, so you can enjoy a drink while waiting... the time flies by!"
"2 hour wait for a table, then 1 hour wait for pizza.We were soooo hungry that we ordered French fries at a pizza restaurant. Don't do that...Pizza is the main course and it's the highlight of this place. You can order half size toppings to create two different styles of half pizzas. Just remember it's very long wait and the restaurant itself is very crowded. I'm almost sure I'm gonna order take out only next time."
"I used to think numero unos pizza was best till i had a pizza at pequads Amazing! and staff was great, when in town its a MUST!!!!!"
"**Vegetarian Friendly**This place is always busy! Definitely a good amount of wait time. Also be prepared to wait for your food because it does take about 45-60 minutes to make one pizza. This is a pan-style pizza as opposed to the traditional Chicago deep dish, but it's equally good. Really enjoyed it because the crust had a nice crisp to it, as opposed to something more soggy/chewy."
"Deep dish!! Yassss!! The pizza did take about 40 mins, but totally worth the wait. We ordered 2 large- add the italian sausage, the pieces are huge. 2 pieces will keep you full all day! Amazing stuffed crust too!"
"The best pizza I've had, period! The pan pizza style is delicious. I cannot wait to go back :D"
"I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza, it's too heavy. But Pequod's is the exception. Somehow they manage to get a crust that's light and crunchy, with a great caramelized touch. Skip the tourist traps on Michigan and make the extra effort to come here, it's worth the trip and the wait (yes, you will have to wait, but unlike the other deep dish places, you won't regret it)."
Perfect savory/sweet balance on the sauce.  Caramelized cheese on the crust.Best deep dish pizza OFYOUR  LIFENo lie.  That is all.
"Far and away my favorite place to take out-of-towners for pizza. The crusts are amazing. If time is an issue, I would recommend calling ahead with your pie order"
Fantastic deep dish. No gimmicky atmosphere. Quick service and reasonable prices. Would recommend as a deep dish spot if you have people visiting from out of town.
"Best deep dish pizza ever!!! I've had Pequod's 4 times now (3 being in the restaurant, 1 delivery). If you can, eat inside the restaurant because delivery order just does not taste as good. Ok, let's talk about the pizza. And THE CRUST! The caramelized burnt crust is amazing. It's the best part of the pizza in my opinion. These are my go to toppings:Pepperoni, pineapple, green pepper, mushroom, onion Ordered sausage before and it was just too much on my opinion. As for appetizers, I've gotten the mozzarella sticks and bruschetta. They are both good but nothing special. It's nice to eat some light appetizers if you're waiting 40-50 minutes for your pizza."
"On vacation from California and I was recommended to Pequods from all the locals. This place is delicious, and the the vibe is great. Perfect after a game since they're open late. Only thing I recommend is that you come in with an empty stomach!"
The crust. Yum. I get why people talk about it. Cozy family friendly place and my kid loved the food as well. We will be back! Plus they take reservations so that's a plus!!
"My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago! They usually have a long wait, so either go early or plan to wait 1+ hours. Worth it though!"
"This place really was as good as I've heard. The service was nice and the pizza was so good. That caramelized cheese crust is to die for. I've always been a fan of the burnt cheese on any pizza, so this place really hit the spot. The only bad thing is the wait. And because the pizza is so good, it makes waiting all the more annoying."
My favorite pizza in the city so far.  The personal pan had plenty of caramelized cheese.  It was worth the 40 minute wait and I can't wait to go back again!
"Loved my first experience at Pequod's! Very casual, non-imposing atmosphere with killer pies- check it out!!"
"The pizza is good. Very good. It's my favorite deep dish, and the caramelized cheese crust makes themagic happen.  During dinner hours, the wild wait is worth it only if you're trying to drink a lot of beers with buds next door or if you've got an out of town guest visiting. The golden deal is their lunch hour weekday personal pan, which comes out to around $10 with a drink. It's on the short list of places to hit up when I'm playing hookey from work during the week."
"The first dinner of the bachelor party was Chicago deep dish at Pequod's. I've been to all the other places in Chicago, so I saved this one for the party. There were 14 guys, and we ordered two large pies. Order a few pitchers of beers, and that's enough for all. We ordered one pie with sausage and pepperoni and the other was a cheesy garlic pie. I'm getting hungry just writing this review, but they were both great. Caramelized crust, and delicious toppings. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm coming back here for more."
"The best pizza in Chicago!  There is always a wait unless you get there early, but well worth the wait."
Everything u heard is true! Good pizza and even better appetizer's. Go during off hour's- after lunch Tuesday - Thursday ENJOY!
"It was deeeeeeeeelicious. I loved it. I ordered a spinach, garlic, onion, and half sausage and it was a perfect ratio of ingredients. I was a little concerned because I read a lot of reviews complaining about the ""breadiness"" of the pizza but it was a classic deep dish. I will definitely be back. We went on a Sunday for lunch and I enjoyed it because it wasn't crazy busy and didn't  have to wait."
"I mean, like, honestly. You know what's going on here. You're getting cheese gooey crispy crunchy caramelized pizza. And you're probably with someone who's visiting from out of town. Expect to wait for a table, then expect to wait for the pizza to cook. Some of, if not the singular, best Chicago deep dish available without the rigmarole of Burt's (RIP, you pioneer!). Love on the sandwich menu where it says ""There's no beating our meat!"" They know what they did there, and I saw it."
"Awesome pizza and a great location. Perfect for after the movies because it's right across the street from Regal. And after 10pm it is not so busy, you don't have to wait at the door, so it's a win-win!"
"Worth the hype. I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza at all, but this was seriously the best pizza I have ever had!!! My friend and I ordered a small pan pizza, which was perfectly filling for two. Choice of toppings is minimal, but I'm sure even just cheese is more than satisfactory. My friend and I had half vegetarian and half pepperoni and sausage. If you have never been here, you're missing out. If you plan on coming here, be prepared to wait during peak times. Most people waiting at Pequods end up waiting at the bar next door. If you ordered drinks or food at the bar next door and you are called at Pequods, the bar will actually call Pequods to hold your table! My friend and I waited for 1.5 hours and didn't eat dinner until almost 10 pm since it takes time for the pizza to bake, but it was worth it! If I lived in Chicago, I'd probably make weekly trips."
Ordered it delivery. I thought I didn't like it... reheated leftovers next day ..knew it was fantastic pizza. The crust is the difference...it is delicious...as is the rest of it.
Great service and great ambiance.   I had requested quite a big table for a birthday party and they accommodated us quite well. For having such a big party they were quite efficient and the servers didn't lose their cool for having to serve so many people with so many different requests. Their pizza is amazing and I would def recommend coming here if you are in town.
"One of the best places to eat deep dish in Chicago hands down. This pizza somehow feels lighter than the rest of the deep dish I've had. The caramelized crust, sweet sauce, and quality ingredients make it a place I love to eat at when I'm in the area.The wait here can be pretty long during peak hours so definitely expect it when trying to eat here. The good thing is that there is plenty to see around Pequod's as well as a bar next door that you can get a drink at while waiting to get a table."
"Crust: 5 stars!!! Taste/Toppings (sausage, ground beef, basil): meh 3Service: averagePricing: 4 stars - competitive pricingTip: Call day of to get moved to ""top of the waitlist"" which in my case, meant that when I arrived, instead of a 2 hr wait, I had a 1 hr wait for 3 people.Imagine you're sifting through your laundry, determining what to load in the washer next, do you pick your underwear? your stacks of stinky tshirts post-gym? or perhaps, those slacks with food stains? Now, apply this logic determining what you value in pizza to determine which deep dish place is your favorite. Pequod's ain't perfect, but it can be perfect depending on your pizza preferences. In my college heyday, I gorged myself with quite a bit of Giardano's and Lou's, but never got around to trying what many deemed to be the ""best deep dish"" in town aka Pequod's. What I got: Personal size half sausage, and half ground beef + basilCrust: PERFECTION. Described to be a ""caramelized"" crust and boy, can you see it! Giardano's has the soggy cardboard crust of death. Lou's crust has great taste but still can get dry or mush in the middle. Pequod's has a beautiful crunchy crust THROUGHOUT including the middle bottom. Tell me thy saucery!Everything else: sausage was pretty bland, Lou's sausage is by far superior. I also like the ground beef itself by Giardano's better. Passing grade for the cheese. I did like the fact that the sauce is not too watery.Atmosphere: very casual, has seating upstairs and downstairs, 45min or more to get your pizza cooked depending on how busy it is. Bar and hockey type of atmosphere.Bottom line: If perfect crust is what you desire - this is a must go. Too soon to call it for me in regards to the superiority of this to Lou's, definitely better than Giardano's and Uno's. May not be worth it for an extra long wait though. Will be back to try other toppings!"
Great place for a group! We had friends visiting from out of town and we shared two pizzas and two pitchers and everyone paid about $10!
"Baby Friendly: 5 starsKid Friendly: 5 starsWe had lunch here last week on a weekday, and it was good.  The lunch special is a great deal!Pequod's isn't my favorite pizza, but it is a solid Chicago pizza (and that is saying something).  I wasn't impressed with the salad or garlic bread, so don't order those.  Get the deep dish pizza.  We had a deep dish spinach lunch special, and a large deep dish spinach and onion.  Both were great.The staff was really friendly and helpful.This place is very kid friendly.  We brought our baby in his car seat.  They have wooden high chairs for kids, and they flip them upside down to hold the baby car seat.  This is super helpful.  They were friendly to the baby.  There were other tables with young children, and they all seemed happy and well treated.  The place that make's Pequod's super family friendly?  The family bathroom!  We were seated upstairs, and the women's bathroom was small so I asked if there was a place to change the baby.  The server pointed me to the family bathroom and I was so impressed.  The family bathroom is big, has a sink in it's outer part and a stall with a koala care changing table in it.  So either parent (or both parents) could bring all of the kids in together!  That is fantastic!  Way to go Pequod's!Also, what kid doesn't like pizza?"
"I love this place. Im from Dallas and when I come to Chicago, Pequod's is a must eat place! It's hard to get in. Check the Blackhawks schedule before you come... if there is a game, there will be a longer wait! Also, don't ask to change the TV to another game unless perhaps it's Monday night football and then they may oblige. The food here is amazing! The pizzas take about 40 mind to make... in fact there is a sign that tells you that when you check in... but they are worth the wait!The waiters are super friendly! They have a great pretty decent beer list with a little bit of everything on it."
"There's not much to say about this place that hasn't been said before. Everyone has their preferences and gripes about deep dish pizza.What I will say is that deep dish isn't something I can eat as often as thinner crust pizza. It's a special kind of thing, which is what I like about Pequod's. It's got that feeling of an old-style dine-in pizzeria that makes me feel like I'm a kid again, coming to a pizza joint with my friends after soccer practice or something. It's got TVs, goofy shit on the walls, but serves beer. It's like Chuck E. Cheese's out-of-work uncle who smokes Pall Malls and buys underage kids booze. That being said, these guys card so stay away y'all delinquents. To quote Melville, ""It is not down on any map; true places never are."""
It's all about the crust here! Best part of the pizza. They do a great job of sauce cheese and topping balance so you get enough in each bite. The wait is worth it.
"Came to Chicago for the first time and was craving the city's famous deep dish pizza. While I heard many different recommendations as to who was ""the best"" - Pequod's was definitely at the top. Trusting my fellow foodie friends, I ordered a small pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeno pan pizza.HOLY MOLY was that pizza good. The caramelized crust is out of this world - I could slice off just the outsides of the pizza and eat it by itself. BUT enjoying the pizza bit my bit and getting to the crust at the end of each slice is just as good of a reward. Overall, a very solid, delicious (and filling) pizza.While I can't speak to the other ""bests"" out there, I'm not sure that I need to - this place was amazing and I highly recommend it."
"Awesome Chicago pizza.  We stopped at Girodano's, and while good, didn't quite hit the spot.  Pequod's certainly did!"
This is my favorite deep dish of all time! I would make it a priority if visiting Chicago. You can get a beer at the bar and order ahead when you're waiting for a table. Lou Malnati's is good but Pequod's is way more authentic. I'm vegetarian so I just get my pies piled with every single veggie they offer and the crust is good enough to hold them all.
By far my favorite pizza place. Every time I come here for work I always make time to stop by for the deep dish.  Get there as early as possible because it always fills up. Pequod's is also way better than any of the deep dish chains around town.  Zucchini slices are a great starter as well.
"I'll start off by saying I'm a huge NY style pizza fan. I've had Lou's in Chicago and honestly I don't get the hype. I decided to try this one out my next time in Chicago because it seems as though it's more of a Sicilian pizza than deep dish. For starters the wait was an hour on a Thursday night, which is fine I don't complain about lines especially when the place is actually packed and all seats are being used. The pizza, something was great about it and something was lacking. While it comes out looking beautiful, it just didn't have A TON of flavor. But then I loved it because it was a good Sicilian pizza. I'm not sure, tbh I really couldn't put my finger on whether or not I loved it or it was decent. I think next time I visit I'll go again during a time it's not as busy."
"Had to come here as I'm visiting from Calif. Best deep dish pizza ever, crispy crust and heavy on the toppings. So glad I paid them a visit, delish!"
"Pequod's is what visitors and tourists think of when they hear Chicago Style pizza! These guys do an incredible job, have an amazing lunch deal an deliver top notch pizza at every visit. It's tough to say which Chicago Style Pizza is the best in town... but Pequod's competes for that title every time we visit.A ""must have"" in Chicago!!"
Best pizza in Chicago. Hands down! SThe sauce to cheese ratio is right where is should be.
"Lou Malnotti's who? You want great pizza, this is where to go! I did take out, so I don't have anything to say about the service or location, but ordering take away was super easy and such a delight!"
"Awesome pizza. Worth the wait and you will wait. Even with a reservation. Recommendation: bar seat. Great service and no wait! I mean, you still wait 45 min for your deep dish, but that's a given!"
My favorite pizza in Chicago. The cheese lined crust is what sets it apart. Homemade toppings make for an incredible slice.
"If I was a huge fan of Chicago style pizza, this would be my favorite.  I prefer a thin crust but for years have heard people rave about Pequod's.  It's good, really good.  The crust is so crispy, they put the perfect amount of sauce on too.  We went on a Saturday and surprisingly were seated within 10 minutes of our arrival.  Our server was really pleasant as well."
"Dear Pequod's, I love you. Sausage and giardiniera pizza every time. And they have ginger ale fountain soda. Magical place."
"I couldn't give Pequod's less than 5 stars. I've been here on multiple accounts and received nothing but great service and quality food (BIG PORTIONS). I love deep dish and I love cheese pulls. Each slice of these pies are solid cheese pull slices. I think what makes their deep dish different (and my favorite part about the pizza personally) is the burnt cheese crust. It's a surprisingly amazing taste and unfortunately something I'm craving most days. Don't be turned off by the ""burnt"" description because it couldn't be done any other way. The deep dish is delish! 5 STARS PEQUODS!! Side note: you will most likely be put on a wait. Don't give Pequod's 4 stars because you had to wait 45 mins-Hour to be sat down. This place is televised and is truly a Chicago gem. Tourist and locals flock here. Worth the wait so just keep that in mind when writing your own review!"
"SoCal native just visiting the area.Had to try the famous Chicago deep dish!The crust is the best! Sauce was a little bland, and the basil was hardly noticeable. But overall the pizza was worth a try. Visited pretty early on a Saturday (1pm) and it wasn't packed. I think they had about 6 beers on tap. Noticed a Sculpin IPA-- little taste of my hometown San Diego, ha. Pretty good, stomach-filling pizza!"
"Visited here for the first time with my daughter lastnight for a half order of bbq wings (I'd get a full order next time), medium thin crust sausage and pepperoni pizza, and a Miller Lite. It's a no frills place with great service. Although it was almost 11pm, the atmosphere was great for families and couples alike. The pizza was delicious! I'll definitely return if I'm in the area!"
"Best. Pizza. In. The. City. **When creating your personalized pizza's, I recommend less toppings and let the delicious crust, sauce cheese combo perform the way it should. The more 'watery' veggie toppings you add to the pizza doesn't taste as good."
"This is the place where we take all of out of town guests, and every single person loves it and hasn't been disappointed. Great take out, and the pizza is unbelievable. Be prepared to wait, it's well worth it!"
"After see Pequod's featured on the Food Network as one of the best pizza places, we had to stop by on our visit to Chicago. We came here for lunch and enjoyed a deep-dish. I liked that they use a cast iron pan for the pizza."
"Damn good pizza, I'll be coming here for life."
"It was okay. I'm a Chicago native and their restaurant was an average sports-related jock place with fairly good pizza. I wasn't super impressed the way some people are. But some people are also garbage. I must stress that I did not DISLIKE this place, but it also was not interesting or wildly unique. It brings the Southwest side -- where I grew up (by Midway) --to the Northside, which is why I posit that people up here love it and think it's amazing. Whereas it's just the same stuff I grew up with."
"We came here at 11pm right after we landed at O'Hare. It was a great treat to have our first meal in Chicago be what it's most famous for, the deep dish pizza! And I have to say that Pequods didn't disappoint. We ordered a small deep dish to share, which was huge! It was enough for both of us to have again for breakfast one morning. The pizza came out very fresh and hot, and you definitely know it was made to order since it takes 45 min to wait for it! The wait was a little long but worth it. I would definitely recommend to come here!"
Best deep dish I've had thus far. CanNOT beat the lunch special! Would definitely recommend.
"A place that gives Lou a run for their money. I love Chicago deep dish and Pequod's style of crust is awesome. We got in quickly, which was awesome... and the service was A+. Will definitely go back, but with only one location in Chicago... I will likely have to pass a Lou to get there. Go here and give it a go. You will not be disappointed."
"Been here twice now and can say it's officially my favorite deep dish (or pan is what they call it or stuffed etc... the crazy excessive fat delicious chicago style pizza!). To me it comes down to the crust. It light, buttery and crumbly with the caramelized crust. Our favorite topping is with sausage and giardiniera Mmmmmmmmm.First time came on a Saturday night, it's a nightmare, 2 hour wait then 45min wait for pizza once you order. Went today Sunday lunch at 1pm, walked right in, no wait for a table. So I'd recommend lunch time for sure to not have the wait dampen the experience!"
"If ya like Deep Dish this is the place...I'm a NY Thin Crust guy but when in Rome right..there's lots of choices for deep in Chi-town and I have sampled a handful this is tops only because of the crust, the outer is a glazed burnt cheese wonder...little chewy but its thick crust so go and be hungry"
"If I ever crave deep dish, this is my go to spot. When I have out of town visitors, I recommend this place over anything else. The pizza is delicious, thick and I dare say JUICY (with cheese). The absolute best part is the crust. It's hard and chewy and delicious. It's so good a lactose intolerant person like me thinks it's worth the pain to come once I'm done. Typically I order sausage for my toppings, but I've also had giardiniera (yum) and green pepper mixed in. It's hard to go wrong. One or two slices are filling, so this place is great for groups OR for someone that's extremely hungry. Speaking of groups, there is an upstairs space for seating if you have larger parties. I've also tried their meatball sandwich, tasty, but I wouldn't make a trip out here for that. The only con is that the wait times are so very long, so this isn't a spot I come to without planning for a wait. Keep in mind, you also have to wait a while for the pizza since it takes a while to make it (like all deep dish). I recommend doing priority seating online, which isn't really a reservation, but it does help with the wait sometimes."
Anytime i come to chicago Pequods is a must the best deep dish pizza in chicago dont waste your time going anywhere else
Voted best pizza so had to try and I agree....This is a must go place ... gotta go back again soon
"Five star for sure!This pizza is amazing.  I find some deep dish style pizzas to be a little much - I'm more of a thin crust guy, but this really hit all the marks for me.  Toppings were plentiful and nicely toasted, crust was absolutely incredible and there was a good overall balance between sauce, cheese, and crust.I'd go out of my thin crust comfort zone for this any time.Service was good as pizza places goes, no complaints there whatsoever.  Will definitely be back!"
"Chicago has so many options for deep dish or pan pizza, but that caramelized cheese crust sets Pequod's apart from everywhere else. I usually like to save my crust for last to dip into whatever fallen toppings are on the plate, but that crust is just too good to wait. Eating at Pequod's means that you may wait for 45+ minutes for a table, but fresh in the restaurant is the best way to eat it. I've ordered it for pick and delivery and while it's good, it doesn't stand to the excellence of dining in. Their sauce is so well seasoned, the crust is crispy and they have fun toppings to choose from (pineapple, variety of olives... what can I say, I'm easy to please) and it even tastes good reheated. Waiting to dine in or delivery can be a little tedious, but once you're eating that pizza it's easy to forgive and forget.  Pequod's is a vessel filled with crispy, cheesey, gooey, oily goodness and my mouth is Moby Dick and I'm gonna destroy and consume everyone and everything on board."
"Stellar deep dish and different than the typical giordanos, Gino's, and Lou's. The crust here is different, and the sausage is made in house apparently. These differentiating factors make the pizza here unbelievably tasty and heavy! Great with a refreshing beer to wash it down. I also like starting with a salad, and their house salad is a great starter to the meal. Even super crowded on a Monday afternoon, so that tells you something about their delicious pizza.I wasn't a big fan of the service though I have to admit. This is probably the only reason pequod's isn't a five star joint for me, but excellent pizza and vibes nonetheless!"
"When in... Chicago, you must try a deep dish pizza. It is my first go at a Chicago style pizza & my friend picked the best place that offers generous portions of toppings, cheese & red sauce. We kept our pie simple with 2 toppings: mushroom & sausage. A good decision because the pie with 1 inch of all it's goodness was rich in flavor & filling after one slice. I can also taste the fresh ingredients, which makes this pizza a standout as well."
"Whenever you're home in sweet oldChicago, you gotta go 45 min out of whichever way you are coming from to get that goodness that is the caramelized crust that is Peaquods. I tell everyone about this place if they are visiting our fine city because it's that good."
"Super long wait, but the deep dish is great. Probably my favorite in Chicago to be honest."
"Good pizza, good prices, good service. I'm not wild about the burnt crust, but I know good deep dish when I have it, and this is good. There's definitely better deep dish out there, but Pequod's fulfills my constant deep dish craving."
"Not sure about all of the rough reviews, because Pequod's was amazing! We ended up here late on a Saturday night after the Patriots game ended from Tripoli's tavern. It was our first night in Chicago so we were looking for a deep dish fix and thankfully Pequod's had late night hours to accommodate us. Service was top notch from the moment we stepped in until we left. Our waitress was friendly and peppy and explained the menu, jumping us right to the page with the deep dish (she knew) and explaining how many servings/pieces each size of pizza was (whether you would have leftovers or not). She also indicated the 'wait time' as some are calling it or how long it takes them to make you an amazing pizza. Geez, people. We opted for the small pan pizza with pepperoni, jalapeño and Italian sausage and an order of cheese bread with homemade, I repeat HOMEMADE marinara. The marinara was amazing and the bread was also pretty great and came out quick after our order was taken. The wait for the pizza was probably less than what was quoted to us.  The pizza--came served hot, oh so delicious and flavorful. We loved the burnt, crisp crust, a different spin on deep dish. The Italian sausages were ginormous and it was stacked with pepperoni (worth that extra charge per topping). I was only sad that I couldn't finish my pizza in one sitting. And, prices were so reasonable-our bill was under $30. We also had Gino's on this trip, and while a classic staple of Chicago, it didn't compare to the food quality received at Pequod's. I would love to try them again next time I am in town."
"Looking for good deep dish? Pequods is the best hands down. The carmelized cheese crust is amazing. Its what I reccomend to all our out of town guests.  However, go during lunch and avoid the long wait for the dinner rush."
"If you want Chicago style deep dish (not from a chain) GO TO PEQUOD'S! We went to a Cubs game and wanted to grab some pizza after while we were in town. We happened to be with someone from Chicago who told us about Pequod's...as we were planning on going to a different place. So happy we changed our mind and went to Pequod's. It was a Friday night so we knew we would have to wait...luckily our friend called ahead and put our names down for call ahead seating. We ended up only waiting about 10 minutes for our table of 4. We got a large pan pizza...half pepperoni half italian beef and hot giardiniera. I don't normally like thick crusted pizza, but this pie was amazing. I also have never had giardiniera before - and that was life changing!"
Solid deep dish option. A little less thick than other varieties in the area but just as food. The charred crust is definitely the most note-worthy part of the pizza. The small is huge and sauce is delicious. The anchovies are good with salty goodness. The best part is they deliver pretty far. Pequod's is a great option for late night eats. But give yourself an hour and half for sure if delivery.
"We had unfortunate car trouble that kept us from going back home to MKE, so we did an intensive search to find Chicago pizza on Christmas Day! We were happy to find that this very popular place was open so late at night. It was pretty late (maybe already 10pm), so we were only picking up, but inside it was surprisingly very busy! I think the staff were surprised too at how many people would be coming out on a cold Christmas night! We thoroughly enjoyed solid Chicago style pizza with their ""carmelized"" crust. Very filling on a cold Christmas night. Would definitely look to try again and consider braving the Wait to sit down."
"Absolutely amazing Pan Pizza. This won't be considered a deep dish pizza, so Lou Malnati's and Giardanos are different types of pizzas. But this is by far the best pizza in town. The service was great. Prices are very reasonable. $5 for a personal pizza with a drink. It was definitely Filling. If your in the city, Pequod's is a must. You wont be disappointed"
The atmosphere is very casual and local. You are welcomed with pretty friendly service. They are nice and patient. The pizza is less doughy and saucy compared to all the other deep dish pizzas. The sauce isn't as tangy. The sleeper here is the meatballs. They are some of the most tender meaty goodness that I have had. The sauce that they come with is rich in flavor and had a subtle smoky flavor to it.
I always love the pizza here. It's the way the cheese caramelizes to that cast iron pan. I think they should come up with a pizza that as all edges like one of those brownie pans. I'm a genius!
"Truly in love with their Chicago style pizza. The crunchy edges, delicious sauce (we get extra), great ingredients. The best dough. Our craving for it takes us there often! Totally a no frills place that is always busy. We go for lunch a lot, on weekdays, to avoid the lines and crowds. Also the individual pan pizza lunch special on weekdays can't be beat. Only suggestion to them would be to put more spinach on for the spin topping. After the bake, you don't see much at all."
"Not a fan of the atmosphere,  tv's, sports bar, sometimes too much dumb male meatheads.   But food is fantastic!!!!  Great pizza.  Try any!   Salads top notch.  Not  a fan of high stool tables.  Recommend getting a booth.  Sometimes super busy and slow service, but I have patience and its worth the wait."
"No, it's not technically Chicago deep dish, it's pan pizza. But it's so much better! The caramelized crust is perfection. You honestly don't need more than 2 slices or you'll be down for the count.There will always be a wait. It's just how it is!"
Perfect crust on an amazing deep dish pan.so glad we picked this over the chains. Could not be better.
"This was my first time eating deep dish pizza and o boy was I impressed. I came on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait. When I thought about deep dish pizza, I thought that it would be a thin crust surrounding the pan filled with sauce and cheese. However, there is more crust than I had imagined and it is so light and fluffy, which is something I had never experienced when eating pizza. There was just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and they didn't overdo it with the toppings. It wasn't that oily either, which is unlike the pizza I have had in New York. I loved it especially the cheese that crisped up on the side of the cast iron pan. My friend and I got a large pizza with sausage and pepperoncini on one side and pineapple and Canadian bacon on the other (don't judge my friend really likes pineapple on pizza). If you like spice, definitely get pepperoncini. We could not finish the large even though we wanted to and would get a medium next time. This is a must try if you are like me and have never been to Chicago before!"
"BEST PAN PIZZA IN CHICAGO. Worth the wait! Sit down, order a beer, and wait for the magic that is about to become your best pizza experience in Chicago."
"My favorite Chicago pizza joint by far. I skip out on the flashy tourist joints like Lou Malnati's every time I come back to the city, and head straight here instead. The numerous positive reviews are accurate, very homey down-to-earth midwestern vibes. The caramelized pan crust is phenomenal, I appreciate it when places focus as much of their effort on the crust as they do for the toppings.  Simple, and great quality. Service was efficient and very nice."
One of the best pizza places in Chicago by far. The carmelized crust is so tasty and the sauce is great. I love going there and even ordering it to go.
Never a bad experience. It's a little tight inside but the pizza is so worth it. Everything about the crust is amazing!
"Oh the caramelized crust!!!...Honestly my favorite pizza ever, anywhere. It differs from the traditional deep dish pizzas found elsewhere in the city. More along the lines of pan style that must be attacked by knife and fork. Having been to the Pequod's in Morton Grove originally. I fell in love. So when it was time to visit my family for the holidays. This was my first stop immediately leaving the airport. I've been craving it for over a year since my move to San Diego. And it did not disappoint. We got my go-to deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno. The cheese gets crispy and caramelized along the edge providing that crunch to go with the soft dough and buttery pie-like bottom crust. The toppings are plentiful and savory."
"Here. For. It.  Best deep dish in the city.  No question.  Don't believe me, don't go (more for me and mine)."
10/10 Will return. Grew up eating Pequods in MG with the lovely lady in all the photos hung on the walls. Viva la Foof. Love you CKB.
"Amazing pizza, made to order, the service was awesome. The food was too delicious. Cheese melted running down is one satisfactory factor of eating pizza."
"Sometimes, this place is easily 5/5 and some of the best deep dish in the city. Other times...well...not so much. I've had experiences here where the crust was so perfect and crispy, and the pizza was perfect. I've also had the reverse where the pizza seemed almost soggy. I will keep coming back chasing that 5/5 experience though."
"The pizza was great, especially the crust which was super crispy. I loved the environment and will come back soon."
"I've only had the deep dish here twice but, both times walked away very satisfied! Ingredients were plentiful (sausage, mushroom, spinach) and although the crust is quite thick, I did enjoy the ""burnt"" cheese edges. This pie is probably not for everyone but, judging by the daily packed house and people waiting in line, they are doing something right.Kids got the thin pizza as well and that was very good too. Service was average but, overall no complaints. Seating was a challenge, especially if you have any large people in your group but, manageable.Overall, a good place to get a little different spin on Chicago deep dish pie!!"
"Pequod's chooses to focus on crust over cheese. This deep dish pizza has a biscuit like buttery crust that is covered with a thinner layer of sauce and cheese than competing deep dish stores. Their signature caramelized crust is actually a layer of cheese on the outside side edge and is fantastic, albeit a little burnt. But no complaints from me, huge fan of burnt cheese. Wait can be long, but there is a nice bar next door that you can grab a drink while waiting. Still a thin crust pizza fan at heart but enjoyed the change of style for the evening."
"Ok, so after what must have been a year of planning, procrastinating and failing to get into this place for dinner, a group of us finally braved the wait, the 50-minute pizza prep time and went in.The good - the pan pizza (we got pepperoni with pepperoncini) was REALLY EXCELLENT. Long after my stomach was overfull with the pizza my taste buds were still craving for yet another slice. Seems like a sure way to pick up some serious weight...The less good - the service is somewhat rough. There seemed definitely to be a feeling of ""we're so good and so popular that we'll do what we want, treat you how we want to and if you don't like it there are a 100 people waiting behind you"". Yes, yes, you're good and popular and all, but service is still supposed to matter. This is the only reason for my not giving 5 stars. I hope they pay more attention to that.Still a great experience."
"Delicious deep dish pizza that's worth the 45 minute bake time. The sauce is tangy, delicious, and not too salty, and the crust is perfectly thick but crispy. I make sure to go to Pequod's every time I visit Chicago because I always crave a half sausage, half spinach pizza. Unfortunately, the second time we went, our pizza came out a little lukewarm, and the cheese wasn't hot enough to be oozing out and stretchy. Nonetheless, the flavors were as consistent as the first time we visited, and we left satisfied."
The best deep dish pizza in Chicago hands down. Their burnt cheese crust is amazing. Be prepared for a wait almost any time you go in. It's very popular since they only have one location near downtown. Here is how I would compare it to the competition. Pequod's is the best overall. Giordano's has the best quality cheese. And Lou Malnati's has the best sausage pizza. Chicago Oven Grinders is another unique beast of its own that's definitely worth trying. Avoid Gino's East if you can.
"Visiting from out of town, Pequod's was recommended to us. This pizza was one of my favorite meals ever! The only thing I didn't like, was that I was too full to eat a second slice."
"So, I had an appetite for pizza and decided to visit Pequod's. Words can't convey how delectable my food tasted. The waitress was extremely professional, friendly, and energetic. She exuded a contagious energy that brightened my day. The drinks, on the other hand, were weak and nothing to brag about. Overall, i'd highly recommend. 5 stars for food and 3 stars for the drinks."
"Great pizza, great garlic cheese bread, great drinks, but there's a tiny sink in the upstairs bathroom which is super weird....great other than that!!!!"
"I'm not a huge fan of deep dish/Chicago-style pizza; I'll never deny that much.That said, when in Chicago . . . yeah. It's a Chicago thing.And if you're in Chicago, it's downright blasphemous to NOT stop in for pizza at Pequod's. PERIOD.I'd rather come here than take my chances at Lou Malnati's any day of the week. Damn skippy.Try the giardiniera. Be sure, too, to try simply onion and garlic together. (Really good stuff!) I always just get half and half -- half giardiniera and half onion/garlic.Why bother with garlic bread and Buffalo wings, for fuck's sake? This is a PIZZA joint, and you're here to eat (deep dish, Chicago-style) PIZZA.A salad? Maybe -- to start.A cold beer? Absolutely -- that's almost a given.But all this other food on the menu? Meh.P.S.: Both locations are loud and crowded, but, hey, that's a GOOD sign. P.P.S.: The website sucks -- looks like they paid a college kid to put it together on GoDaddy.P.P.S.: You're not going for romantic seclusion, nor to look at a website, crappy or not. The food's damn good, and THAT'S what you go to Pequod's for."
Scale 1-10 of how good their pizza is... I would say 7. It's nothing life changing but it is worth the wait. I would say top 5 favorite pizza places in the city. I wouldn't consider their pizza traditional deep dish but it is a solid pan pizza. The wait staff was great! Overall great experience.
"Best pizza in Chicago hands down!! If I could give more then 5 stars I would - it's that good. Whenever I'm craving a good pizza, this is my go to spot. From the in house special sauce to the  caramelized crust and the crisp yet airy dough, this pizzas got it all. Personal favorite toppings - giardiniera + basilMake sure you eat it there as the crust has a 15 min tasty life otherwise gets soggy and need to put back in the oven. This place gets crowded on thursdays and weekends.Also the Lincoln park location is much better then the Morton grove location. I wish they opened one up in the western burbs, but until then, I'll be coming to the city often."
"First bite is yummy, 1 slice is good, but no more after that.Got a medium with 3 toppings and a pitcher of blue moon.Couldn't finish the medium pizza among 3 people."
The lunch special is amazing! $4.95 for a personal pizza. You can add a salad for only $2.50 more and it comes with a drink. Pizza is really delish!!
This resturants is really packed all the time and the wait is long but the food is worth the wait. I got a pepperoni deep dish and it is one of the best deep dishes in chicago. Highly recommend.
The service was great. Cheesy garlic bread was good but probably would not order it again. The cheese pan pizza was also good but more bready/ less cheese than other Chicago pizza spots. It's hard to compare pequods to a traditional deep dish pizza since it's pan here.. but I think I do prefer a more cheesy dip dish style. The best part was definitely the caramelized crust!
"As many others have said, it's the skillet style cooking! The cheese carmelizes, I don't know if they have it, but they should just do a no crust pizza of just cheese and fillings, gracious it's delicious! But the crust is really special too. Do yourself a favor, don't settle for mediocre pizza, life is too short!"
"We went to Pequod's after a bodybuilding competition, which means that it's time to pig out and see how fast you can go from ripped to fat again. That would probably sound cooler if I was the actual bodybuilder, but it was actually my friend so instead it was time to pig out and see how fast I could go from fat to fatter. The servers were über-friendly and the pizza arrived in stages but looked great. We ordered pizzas with peppers and sausage, mushrooms and ham and even a basic pepperoni thin crust pizza  for the annoying, picky guy (me). I inhaled my entire pizza and thankfully, the servers were gracious with the coke refills to keep my momentum going. The other kids at the table ordered and devoured the bruschetta in record time and everyone seemed to love their pizza. I'm from New York and not a fan of deep dish Chicago style which is why I ordered a thin crust pie. It also explains my pizza snobbery and why I'd be unwilling to grant five stars to anything that didn't knock my socks off. But again, this is good pizza. Great atmosphere. Lots of TVs and friendly folks. Next time I'm in town, as my favorite bodybuilder would say: I'll be back."
"Best deep dish in the city!  If you go to Gino's, Lou's or Giodano's...sorry boutcha, but you're a tourist ;)"
"Yes.....a Chicago institution. Real pizza, not tomato soup on a cracker. Thick and juicy, the crust is heaven. Try it, you'll like it"
Service was great! I recommend ordering an appetizer because the pizza will take some time but is definitely worth the wait! Really loved the atmosphere here!
"Honestly, I could write forever about this pizza ... but why bother. Let me state categorically that I HATE Chicago pizza. Having said that, my Chicago-style pepperoni, sausage and hot pepper pizza was without question one of the best pizzas I have had in my life. Absolutely insane!!!!!Forget ALL the other Chicago big names for pizza .... I have had them all and there is not even anything remotely close. I really could write in great detail, but it would not be enough. See my photos ...."
Best deep dish in the city. Less doughy than others. The crust is basically burnt cheese. The wait can be long but it's worth it!
"Thank you so much for Friday Night...this place is a class act & excellent pizza..we had some nypd guys with us.. Althoughthey were like a fish out of water withReal Pizza, they still give great reviews..Once again Thank you...."
"If you don't already know this place, you're obviously not from chicago.  It's an institution unlike any other here. While it's not my favorite Chicago pizza, the pan is super tasty. Burnt cheese + crispy bottom + bready crust = satisfaction. Don't be alarmed by the apparent size of the restaurant - it has 2 floors and seats a lot more than you realize."
This pizza was actually really good ... the burnt crust was great and loved the atmosphere ...
"This place is a classic and among the best in Chicago.  Forget the big names in the deep dish game, this spot is it and it's legit.   There's always a wait but it's worth it and Drinking Bird Bar is a good place to hang while waiting.  The inside of pequads pays homage to Chicago sports and Blackhawks.Their pan pizza is a perfect blend of ingredients baked to gooey, cheesy and flavorful perfection.  Crust is crispy and buttery.  See what the hype is about!"
"One of the trademarks of Chicago cuisine is its deep dish pizza. While the origins are unclear, deep dish has been a critical defining element of Chicago food for decades, and every time I visit Chicago, I am compelled to go to at least one deep dish pizzeria.Having tried Giordano's and Lou Malnati's in the past, I decided to give Pequod's a try. Located in Lincoln Park, it was rather out of the way of everything else I wanted to do (namely sightseeing in the Loop, and shopping in Chinatown), but I wanted to try it at least once.At the time of writing this review, the base price for a large deep dish is around $18 with no toppings, and then about $2.50 for each additional topping. When it comes to pizza, I like to have many toppings, so I got pepperoni, sausage, Canadian bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. I shared the pizza with 3 other people.I felt that for my appetite, I should have shared the pizza with 4 others instead of 3. The pizza is very thick and filled with toppings. I only managed to eat a single slice - though I did have one piece of garlic cheese bread before that (fairly standard as far as that flavor went). The pizza was perfect deep dish - the crust was crunchy, the cheese was layered and thick, and the toppings all blended together nicely.One of the downsides of deep dish, I feel, is that it's not nearly as good when delivered, because of how thick the pizza is. The pizza gets soggy quickly, and towards the end of the meal I already started to feel the cheese start to be more solid and not as tasty. The trade off is that deep dish, when eaten fresh, is incredibly rich and full of flavors.There are different schools of thought as to whether or not deep dish is ""real pizza"" - some say that pizzas are meant to be more flat and meant to be a nice balance of 50% crust and 50% toppings, whereas others would say pizza is pizza as long as the ingredients are there. Regardless of the case, I do feel deep dish is an incredibly unique way to experience pizza, and it is honestly my preferred way of eating pizza. Pequod's ranks easily as the best deep dish I've had yet, and may be one of the best pizzas I've ever had."
"Been my favorites since my folks took me to the Morton Grove original and told me stories of the infamous Burt.  Stuff is still so good, just remember when dining in its so hot out the gates."
"Once again, the magic of yelp has led me to glory. This place is excellent. Unlike the super deep dish (Also delicious) at other local places, this pan style is equally tasty but less filling (therefore more pizza gets ingested). Maybe the highlight, is that its more of a local gem and not massively crowded like the big deep dish venues. I would recommend!"
"Number ""1"" in my book you can taste each flavor, pan pizza w/carmelize cheese, what a treat, little slow on service but not bad. This dive bar is worth it! It's her first time 9/22/17 yum"
"Oh hell yeah!  Do pequod's followed by a movie at the Webster theaters, you can't beat that evening.  The pizza is a true ""Chicago experience.""  The service is not so great but that only adds to the experience :)!  Seriously good pizza though."
"Both locations have awesome, caremelized cheese edge deep dish pizza."
They caramelize the crust on their deep dish pizza. That is all you need to know.
"My favorite pizza in Chicago. The pan pizza is heaven. And no the crust isn't burnt, haters. It's caramelized and it's deliciously chewy. If you come here on the weekend or in the evening, expect a bit of a wait. And the pizza themselves take pretty long to cook too. But they did have the great idea to open up a cocktail/beer place next door called Whale Tail, so you can booze up a bit while you wait for your table. The only downside is sometimes the pizza can be hit or miss. There's days where it is bland, which I know is crazy to say after proclaiming it to be my favorite pizza spot. But when they hit the mark, it's the best the city has to offer. A good tip is to bring some home and eat it the next day for leftovers after pooping in the oven a bit (no microwave nonsense). It's even better the day after. The staff is also really nice. From the friendly waitresses' to the older gentlemen (with the great head of hair) who is always working the host stand."
The Pequod's restaurant is known for their deep dish pizza with caramelized burnt crust. They typically have a long wait and the pizza takes about 40 minutes to cook once you put in the order. You should put in your pizza order right away because of the long wait.  I suggest you get the deep dish pizza with sausage. The pizza has large chunks of sausage with a hint of spice. You will leave feeling full.
"I was picked up by my Lyft driver, Antoinette, heading to Gino's East but when I asked her where the best pizza in town is, she drove me to Pequod's. It was close to 9pm and a line out the door so you know it's probably good! Fortunately for me, there was a seat at the bar. They had a great beer and drink selection, which is good because you may have a couple before your pizza comes out. It took about 45 min for my pizza to be served, and it was totally worth the wait! Absolutely the best Chicago style pizza I've ever had , hands down! Cannot wait to come back."
"Pequod's Pizza, one of the most famous destinations for deep dish or as they call it, pan pizza in the city most famous for it is a destination worthy of a dedicated visit.. A dive bar atmosphere pervades, but it manages not to feel seedy or gross. The inside is deceptively massive with multiple floors and rooms, so even though it gets packed, the wait time is only occasionally prolonged. The longer wait is for the pizza to actually be cooked, but we end up only waiting maybe 20 minutes even though we're told it will be 40.  There's even beer available from some of the local craft breweries and not just the big domestics as you'd expect at a dive. The deep dish is succulent and doughy. Each slice requires diving in and indulging in a monstrous bite. I love a good pepperoni and this pan pizza has a good pepperoni."
"Of course I had to stop by a deep dish pizza joint when in Chicago! We came around 10pm on a Fri night and waited around 20min. Our server told us that it would take around 45 min for the pizza to cook but ours came out in about 30min. We got a small 10"" pizza with Italian beef, onion, and spinach. This was the perfect size for two people because it gave each of us two huge pieces that really made us so full!! I mean, unbuckle your belt full..I loved the crispy crust and red sauce. The cheese was super gooey that when we took our first bite, it was all stringy! All in all, it was a great deep dish pizza. It didn't blow my mind but it left me feeling satisfied!"
"This place is much better than Giordano's, but doesn't beat Lou Malnati's. However, the crust at Pequod's is very unique. I'd come here just to try the crust. It's very chewy and has a slightly sweet flavor."
"I have been a fan of Pequod's since the mid 1990's.  I've dined at their Morton Grove, IL location as well.  Great pan pizza...perhaps the best if your seeking a non-traditional stuffed or deep dish crust.  The fluffy, caramelized pan pizza crust gives this pizza an additional feature which practically has you licking your plate.  Excellent ingredients, well prepared pizza, plenty of appetizer options makes for an enjoyable pizza dining experience."
Simply one of the best pizza places in Chicago their pizza is different from any other pizza have eaten the staff is always nice food is always good and I always bring my friends Fromvout of town to try
"Best deep dish in the city by far. I've been here at least 25 times and always bring people visiting from out of town. We always order pepperoni, onion and extra cheese. Regardless of your choice of toppings, I recommend ordering extra cheese!"
"Love love LOVE!!!!! this pizza. If you consider yourself a Chicagoan like I do, you must have checked out this place at least once! The only issue is that it is very small and crammed, so I would say it isn't 100% family friendly. I'd still come back because it is some great finger licking good pizza. You never know you might find out if their pizza is for you."
"Came here tonight with some friends, I've had Chicago deep dish and was expecting that in my head, however, it was different than the other deep dish I've experienced since it was ""pan"" pizza. I personally enjoyed this better than the typical deep dish. We got pepperoni and meatball, it was delicious. We had a Pequod's salad and French fries to start, the fries were seasoned with a really good flavor. The dressing on the salad was amazing. The pizza does take 40 minutes to cook but was worth the wait, will go back."
"The pizza was so amazing, we had the deep dish. Our waiter was nice and attentive. I am happy I got to try one of the best deep dish pizza places in Chicago."
"Now this is what I came to Chicago for...some DELICIOUS deep dish pizza!! It's a telling sign when multiple people I know in Chicago tell me that Pequod's is their favorite pizza joint. We came here for lunch and there was still about a 30-45 minute wait. I like how Pequod's isn't a chain (compared to Lou's) and it has a much more homey vibe to it. It's a great pizza pub. It's not located in the downtown area, but it's a definite must if you're visiting Chicago. The trek out is worth it.My buddy and I split a small pizza. They don't have pre-set pizzas on the menu; they really encourage customization. We settled on the cheese only with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and onion. Talk about out-of-this-world pizza!!! I'm a huge fan of deep-dish and to get an authentic taste of Chicago deep-dish pizza was amazing. Everything, from the crust to the toppings, was delicious. I love how the crust is caramelized and I loved the thickness of the pan pizza. Not to mention, the sausages were huge!! Let's just say that each bite was magical.The wait once you're seated can be a while because they make each pizza to order. It might be a good idea for them to take your order while you're waiting to be seated in order to speed up the process. In any case, the wait is definitely worth it and it's probably one of the best deep dish pizzas I've had. I can't wait to go back when I'm in town!"
I LOVE THIS DEEP DISH PIZZA. I've lived in Chicago for a bit now and tried a lot of different deep dishes and this is the best. I am also newly vegan and got it without cheese with all the veggies. It was delicious. Def recommend this place to anyone who wants good pizza!
"I love a good crust so I was super excited to try deep dish in Chicago. Pequod's is away from the center of Chicago but it was still packed. Luckily, we had made ""reservations"" (not real reservations, just cuts your wait time down). We were still seated right away, but were told the pizza would take 45 minutes. Bummer. We started with an order of wings which were nothing special. There's a few sizes you can choose from and you can pay for additional toppings. I chose spinach and fresh garlic. 45 minutes later our pizzas came out piping hot in a cast iron skillet allowing for a crispy, thick crust. Pequod's had more of a sports bar feel, which I did not expect. Overall a solid spot for deep dish."
"Generally, I'm a pretty calm individual. Unless it comes to pizza. I will literally fight anyone who bad mouths Chicago style pizza. (Why are there so many people who hate on the deep dish?! It's a lot of people I have to fight!) So when I got the opportunity to visit Chicago, and got the opportunity to try authentic deep dish, I was in a pizza-induced haze for the weeks leading up to the trip.My boyfriend's brother lives in Chicago, and recommended Pequod's as a place the locals eat at. Now, I don't know how accurate that statement is, especially since I'm not a local, but it was crowded nonetheless! Very crowded. As a party of 4, it took a little while to get seated, but not long at all to be a bother. (I've had longer waits at an Olive Garden.)We ordered two pizzas, with a multitude of toppings, and waited. Both my boyfriend's brother and the waitress warned that it was going to be a while, so I got a salad also. It was delicious, and helped pass the time while I waited for the magnificence that is Chicago deep dish. And when it came, delivered piping hot to the table, I swear I almost fainted.I wish I got pictures, because it was literally one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. Much like one of the wonders of the world, it'll take your breath away. Don't even talk to me about my first bite. It's just a void in my memory because as soon as I put a bite in my mouth, I ascended to a different plane of existence. When I came back down, I can remember the bubbly, gooey cheese, and the flavorful robust sauce, and the crunchy, caramelized crust. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now...Oh, how I wish I could go back! The pizza was so good! The service was fantastic, too. And the price, for the literal pounds of food you're getting, is very worth it. And the interior is very cozy and very homey. One of my favorite parts of Chicago, for sure!"
"I am not a big fan of deep dish pizza.  But this one is pretty delicious.  Get it with fresh garlic, it will make your mouth stinky, but it will make your taste buds dance!"
"As a long-time Chicagoan I can say that Pequod's is my favorite/the best deep dish in the city.  The toppings always seem very high quality to me and the browned cheese on the crust is amazing.  On other deep dish pizzas I never even eat the crust because it's just boring bread; not so with Pequod's.  Like any deep dish place the wait for pick-up or delivery is always pretty long.  If you're trying to order this on a football Sunday, let alone on Super Bowl Sunday, get your order in early or plan on a 2-3 hour wait.  Happy eating!"
Best deep-dish on the Northside IMO. Thin crust is actually amazing as well (a local secret). If you're an out of towner. deep dish takes 45 mins..come early.
We were told Pequod's has the best pizza in Chicago. We were not disappointed. The pizza is so delicious and the service was friendly.
"It's not Chicago without pizza! I always thought Chicago was known for their deep dish pizza, but based of off every Lyft drivers I had, pan pizza is the new hype! Pequod is located outside of downtown Chicago, so I made it a mission to try it during my short stay! The pizza price would be based off of number of toppings. As suggested by our waitress, we got a medium for a party of three. We were worried that 8 slices were three was not enough, but after eating, we were glad we listened. As shown in my pictures, the pizza has a lot of breading. A lot of reviews complained stating it's not deep dish, which is true. The menu clearly says pan- hence all the breading. My only complaint is that it does take 25-30 minutes to make each pizza, so be prepared to wait!"
Pizza was freakin awesome! Long wait to sit and then to get it cooked but well worth it! Stop by if you're in the Chi!
"Totally worth the wait, great pizza always the freshest ingredients.  One of the best in the city,!"
"Wow 5 Stars without a doubt for Pequods delicious deep dish pizza! Known as the newest favorite pizza and deep dish in Chicago. Many locals and especially tourists are more familiar with the popular pizza Chicago brand names such as Lou Malnatis, Giordanos and Uno but there is a new favorite in town in Pequods. Loaded with toppings, surrounded by a crispy and cheesy yet light and airy crust, Pequods delivers a unique approach to the ever traditional deep dish in Chicago.Located in Lincoln Park, Pequods is a tiny restaurant pumping out a lot of ZA! With a tremendous following, Pequods is a favorite to a lot of people in Chicago. I have never tried the thin crust but a lot of people swear by it.. I enjoy a crispy thin crust but when I'm going here there is no doubt I am getting the loaded pepperoni deep dish. It is an incredible pizza and will leave you in a serious food coma."
"the BEST deep dish in the city. all the big name chains that tourists go for cannot compare to the delicious, inexpensive menu at pequod's. when you have friends or family visiting and they want to go for AUTHENTIC chicago deep dish, this is where you should be taking them!"
"Can we talk about lunch specials?  So many times a lunch special does not feel special, but Pequod's does!  Monday - Friday you can get in on a smoking deal!  $4.95 for their personal pizza and a fountain drink is ridiculous (in the best way possible).  Now be aware that is just for a cheese pizza but you can start piling on the toppings for $0.80 each to customize that pie.  I put Giardinera on mine and was repping like a true Chicagoan.  I opted for a lemonade as my soft drink and since it was a weekday off I did choose to them buy myself a beer because pizza and beer, hell ya!   Had some 2 Brothers on draft and was loving my local lunch.  The pie was more a a deep dish style and the cheese had some nice caramelization around all of the edges. Do not be fooled it is not burnt!  Perfect sized meal for lunch but they do make things to order so it will not be a quick meal if you have somewhere to go."
"This place has got to be the best pizza in Chicago. I have been devouring their pizza since the 90s and it has consistently been great. If you havent checked them out , I would recommend you put them on the top of your list. They are a Chicago must try!"
"Disclaimer: I'm a native New Yorker. So I'm temporarily expanding my definition of pizza to include the Italian Pot Pies that Chicago inexplicably calls pizza. Is Pequod's the best pizza in Chicago? I mean, it's better than Unos and Giordano's and Malnati's. But is it the best pizza in Chicago?The first time I went I braved the wait and got the small with sausage. I like the classics. I thought it lacked some serious umami and it gave it a kind of bready flavor. On the other hand, I was a fan of the carmelization and could see the potential in it. Still, the hype persisted, so a few years later I gave it another try. I liked it a lot more the second time around. I got it with the sausage and the fresh garlic,  which has become my go-to for deep dish. The garlic provides the punch that was missing the first time, and it was a much better experience. So it Pequod's the best pizza in the city?My favorite pizza (in Chicago) remains Coalfire, which isn't deep dish and therefore is an actual pizza. And, well, please refer to my disclaimer at the top. I'm probably in the minority here, but my favorite deep dish remains My Pi in Bucktown. There is an additional punch of flavor it gives you that Pequod's hasn't quite been able to match. I love Pequod's crust game,  but everything else falls just a little short by comparison. Despite that, unlike the Au Cheval burger debacle that I will vociferously go to war over, I wouldn't object to anybody saying Pequod's is the best...deep dish...pizza."
"Simply the best crust, deep dish sauce,  and pie in the country.   Great atmosphere and the service is really good.     Love this place, anytime"
Great place to enjoy a great pizza. Hole in the wall but well worth the 45 minute wait for pizza
"Just being down the road from where I work I stopped here for there lunch special.  4.95 for a personal pizza and a soda.  How can you go wrong? I topped mine with sausage, black olives, and green olives. You pay .80 cents for each additional topping. This personal pizza hit the spot for lunch. The pizza had just the right amount of sauce and was done perfectly. When I arrived there was no wait and I just sat at the bar. The service was attentive as he always kept my drink fresh. For under 10 bucks this is certainly a go to place for lunch but make sure you arrive with an empty stomach cause it's filling."
"Great pan pizza; arguably the best, depending on what you like. There is a lot of bread, but the cheesy crust is awesome! Be prepared to wait well over an hour if dining at the restaurant, and order way ahead of time if ordering take-out or delivery."
"This is by far my favorite Chicago style pizza in the city. I don't know why I have never written a review before because it has been my favorite for many years. The crust is the best. The atmosphere is super relaxed and chill because it's basically a bar that serves amazing pizza. They have the bar area downstairs and then a dining room upstairs. They have pretty good appetizers, my friends and family have said the beer is good although I don't drink it. The service has always been good. I've not had one bad experience I've been there a million times. The only thing I can say that is not ideal is that during peak hours the wait is crazy long but that is just a testament to how good it is. So it's on you to plan accordingly. :)"
"Finally I was able to visit this place, I am not from chicago, Being a pizza lover always asked people of the best places for pizza and pequod's was always on everybodys top 5 list. The place was crowded, we got our table in 40 minutes and then our pizza in another 50 minutes.For deep dish the options are less and you can add as many toppings as you want with extra $$ per toppings.The crust was very crispy and that was the best part of the pizza than the taste. Overall the experiance was nice and would like to come again."
"This is my go-to for Chicago style pizza.  Everyone has their favorite, but IMHO, Pequods is the hand's down champ.  The caramelized crust is just everything.  My go to here is sausage, garlic and spinach.  Add some mushrooms if I'm going HAM."
Delicious pizza! Went there with my boyfriend and we ordered a medium. We couldn't finish it because it's a pizza that really fills you up. I will definitely come back along with friends.
"Favorite deep dish in Chicago. This one is known for its crust so it's not quite as heavy/greasy as some of the other big name deep dish joints. Always expect to wait at least 1 hour, but the buzzer works at the neighboring bars so you can grab a drink while you wait."
"I'm not huge on pizza but went there with hang out with friends.  I must admit it was pretty good.  For someone who prefers thin style, that's a huge complement.  I can see why  so many people rave about this place."
"Ordered a personal pan sausage deep dish for takeout on Saturday around 4pm. Was told that it would take around 45mins. We came straight after sharing a personal deep dish from Lou Malnati's so we can compare the two side by side. The one from Paquod's is much larger for pretty much the same price, but the crust is more soggy. The sauce tastes like it's from a canned one but overall it's not bad. Definitely less cheesy than Lou Malnati's. That being said, to each their own and I would suggest trying all!"
"This is the epitome of a Chicago deep dish. The wait was a bit long (around 45 minutes for me), but it was worth every minute. The caramelized crust and the thickness of the breading underneath all the sauce and cheese was perfect. i loved how thick the pizza was and how everything just came together. I got mushrooms and sausage on my pizza and it was just amazing. I do have to note that it's best if you come in a party of 3-5 so that you can share the whole deep dish!"
"Best deep-dish pizzeria in Chicago! Okok so I am still a deep-dish newbie as my only previous experience has been Lou Malnati's. But I really dig the way Pequod's prepares its pizza. There is a reasonable layer of cheese on the bottom with plenty of tomato sauce on top and a crispy crust. If you like mounds of oozing cheese, maybe Lou Malnati's is for you. But I prefer the cheese to be a component in my deep dish (because otherwise, I might as well have a lasagna, right?) The two of us split a medium with garlic, onion, and basil on top. We only managed to finish half, however, but that might be because we had an early dinner and had Purple Pig for lunch... But that just means more leftovers for the next day!"
"This was our first deep dish pizza, which was recommended by a lot of people. We absolutely loved this place. It was so delicious.I highly recommend."
"Came here because it was highly recommended, and I had tried all the other deep dish chains. Our wait was 1.5 hours on a Friday evening. Be prepared to wait if you dine here! The best part of the pizza was the thick and caramelized crust. The rest of the pizza was pretty good, especially the sausage we selected as a topping. However, it wasn't as cheesy as I would've liked it. The crust also tasted and looked quite burnt. Solid place to get deep dish pizza, but I still prefer Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's."
We went to Lou Malnatis first but this place is definitely the real deal original!! If you really want Chicago deep dish! Go here!!
"Delicious pizza, cant wait to go back!  Their crust is so unique!  Really a fun place for the family."
Best pizza in the city. Have loved this place for years. Great lunch special.be prepared to wait for weekend dinners. Delicious.
On a hot summer day the upstairs area can be a bit humid but the pizza was amazing and well worth the wait.
"When there's over an hour wait for a place, you know it's good. I ended up ordering to-go because it was already pretty late on a Friday night and there isn't a huge abundance of seating in the restaurant. Long wait aside, this is some quality pan pizza and after trying Lou Manalti's as well, I can say Pequod's is definitely the superior pizza. Ordered the large (14 inch) pan pizza, with pepperoni, mushroom, olive, and sausage. All the ingredients were fresh. Pizza wasn't too oily. Mozzarella was stringy. And sauce had good tart zing. On my second slice, I realized they do use a lot of crust on the bottom, but when you're eating it you don't really notice.  The caramelized crust is crack. Single-handedly the best pizza crust I've ever had. Bottom line: great quality deep-dish pizza."
Favorite deep dish pizza. I'm not a huge deep dish fan but if I had to choose it would be pequods. Show up early or show up after the rush. The pizza takes a while so be prepared to wait.
"Delicious!  We had a table of 11. We had reservations at 5 and were seated immediately.  Our waitress advised us to put our pizza order in right away as they take 40 minutes or more. We had two deep dish, one spinach and mushroom and another with sausage, peppers and pepperoni.  We also had a flat pizza half cheese and half pepperoni.  My nephew is on a special gluten free diet and the manager took the time to discuss options and they settled on sausage that they would cook especially for him.Service was excellent!  We have had many deep dish pizzas in Chicago and think this is the best we've had.  I highly recommended this place!"
The crust was amazing!!!! If you want a savory pizza go with the Hawaiian pizza! If you are feeling bold do a split between that and maybe pepperoni and mushroom a large (14' works perfect for 3 people)! The wait was worth it!
"After reading the reviews for a few different pizza places, my boyfriend and I decided to check out Pequod's while in town last night. We got there around 5:15 on a Thursday and were seated right away on the second floor where it is much calmer and quieter. When we left an hour and a half later, the place was packed and the downstairs was very noisy. So yes, get there early if you don't want to wait! We ordered two appetizers to hold us over while the pizza was cooking: jalapeño poppers for him ($7) and half order of hot wings for me ($5). My wings were very good- spicy and plenty of meat on them. Plus they give the option of ranch or blue cheese which was nice and also novel for me because at many upstate ny places it's blue cheese or nothin' and I'm not a fan. I'm not sure how long the pizza took but it didn't seem long at all because it came out very soon after we finished with the appetizers... perfect timing! We got a 10"" deep dish pizza with pepperoni and black olives (~$15). My boyfriend wasn't sure about getting the small pizza to split for fear of not having enough, but it was plenty! We actually each could only eat about one and a half slices- and there were four all together. The pie itself was very tasty. Crunchy and chewy crust, lots of toppings, tangy sauce and I actually really liked the toasty burnt cheese ring around the crust which is their specialty. I realized that deep dish is not my favorite--- I'm a thin crust girl at heart! But I'm glad I gave it a shot and I don't think there's a better place than Pequod's to do it."
"Now THIS is the deep dish pizza that we had heard so much about when planning our trip to Chicago. Be ready to wait a long time (over an hour after being seated), but an attentive waitress kept our sodas refilled and we had great conversation while waiting. And, the pizza was worth the wait. This truly felt like a neighborhood spot where you come for the good food and friendly service."
"I went here on a trip based on the recommendation of a Chicago native. The pizza was incredible -- especially the burnt cheese edges. If you're in the area, it's well worth it. Very casual, noisy sports bar vibe and be prepared to wait around 40min after you order. I enjoyed it, though I'd probably do take out if I went again."
Fantastic.   Came here with the family.  Travelled from Houston and were told to visit Pequod's.   Holy Cow.  Get the deep dish pizza.   Delicious and filling.   Enjoy.
Favorite burnt style crust in Chicagoland area. Way different than what you're used to. The individual pizzas are the way to go. Whenever i go bigger the pizza seem more dry and lacks sauce. So if you go big ask for a xtra sauce so you won't be disappointed with a hockey puck arriving to your table.
"This is a constant debate between friends who love it and friends who don't think it's great. I personally am a fan. It does have a lot of crush which might turn some people away, but that's what I like. I got spinach deep dish and would highly recommend."
If you ask me deep dish or thin crust I choose thin crust every day. But as far as deep dish in Chicago Pequods really does it right. Everyone I bring here from out of town falls in love. The crust is delicious here - definitely unique to pequods. Best time to come is when they open so you get seated right away. Order some apps - but stay hungry. I've only ever been able to eat 1 generous slice of deep dish. But it's been well worth it. Leftovers ain't too bad either!
"Best pizza in Chicago. It's worth the wait, sometimes they'll let you call ahead and place your order. Skip the other Chicago pizza joints you hear people talk about, this is the spot to go and where locals go!"
The pizza here is amazing. The portions are huge. We had the deep dish pizza. Everything is pretty quick. We had it before seeing a movie across the street.
"I've gotta say that I definitely like Pequod's better than Lou's!! I've been to Chicago twice now and have tried both places during both visits. Pequod's definitely takes the cake on this! ...or should I say pizza? Hehehe. They do a pan pizza, so I guess it's not the traditional deep dish in a sense but it's still my favorite in Chicago! And they give generous portions of pepperoni! Every bite literally had at least 3 slices of pepperoni in it. It takes about 40 min for their pizzas once you place the order so we called ahead and just did take out! The middle ended up being a tad bit soggy but it was still all good to me. It's more of a bar vibe in there so it's a great place for big groups. Definitely a must visit when coming to Chicago!"
"AWESOME deep dish pizza!! Much better than both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. I don't know why it's taken me so long to try this place out! I suppose the other two aforementioned pizzerias are more famous to non-native individuals roaming about Chicago for some deep dish delight (such as myself) because they are established chains and have quite a few locations on the map. However, Pequod's blows either of those other two out of the water!My friend and I were seated in the adjacent Whale's Tale in order to be served faster, but we were assured that the pizza we would be getting was produced by Pequod's. Additionally they told us that we would only be able to order the appetizers available at Whale's Tale as well, and not from Pequod's, which wasn't an issue for us as we didn't get any appetizers. I'm not sure exactly how the relationship between the two establishments functions, but it worked out to our benefit as we were seated immediately, were able to place our orders as quickly as possible, and were served the pizza in only 25 or so minutes. I believe that the maître d' said they actually served the pizza at Whale's Tale even more quickly than if we had placed our order seated in Pequod's, which I also don't understand.Small 10"" Pan Pizza w/ pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and green pepper -  My friend and I initially wanted to overload the pizza with all the toppings, but the waitress serving us mentioned that having too many could cause the pizza to undercook, and so we only got got these four toppings, which I am super glad we did now in retrospect. I LOVE the ""carmelized"" crust on their deep dish, which is essentially just some slightly burnt cheese. It adds a nice crunchiness to the crust and actually doesn't have too much of that acrid flavor associated with burnt cheese - it does have a small amount of it, but just the right amount. The bread was so soft and fluffy - I was surprised how much bread there actually was in each bite. Initially I thought there was too much, but as I kept on eating I began to enjoy the fact that there was so much of it. It really helped to hold each bite together, and there was so much flavor in the toppings, sauce, and cheese, that I didn't feel like the bread was excessively drowning out and diluting the flavor of any of the other components in the pizza. Again awesome AWESOME deep dish.Overall an amazing deep dish experience. As a Californian, I've always heard about the wonders of deep dish pizza in Chicago, and up until now I've always been slightly disappointed. Pequod's is amazing and has definitely set the bar for me for deep dish pizza! If you've never tried deep dish before in Chicago, I would definitely DEFINITELY recommend passing over Lou Malnati's or Giordano's and trying this place out instead, especially if you only have time to try one place. Unmistakably the best deep dish in Chicago that I've tried so far!"
"This is my favorite deep dish in a city known for deep dish pizzas. Great crust, quality toppings, but what puts it over the top is the crisped up cheese on the crust---so good. They own a bar next door if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table"
"Great pizza! To me, the ratios of dough, sauce and toppings is just right . It takes awhile to get your pizza but they let you know that before you sit down. I recommend coming early instead of during the dinner rush as your wait will be way longer !"
"Pequod's was my first crack at authentic Chicago style pizza in Chicago. In fact, it was the very first stop we made upon arrival into the Windy City and it certainly did not disappoint. Their specialty is the ""caramelized crust"" edge on their pan style pizzas. The cheese was oozing out onto the side of crust and it was full of cheesy goodness. This is how they differentiate themselves from the competition and they execute it very well. We got a large sausage and pepperoni deep dish which was essentially a meat lovers pizza. Each bite was bursting of flavor and left us completely stuffed at the end. The only issue I had was that it was too crusty for my liking. I prefer a traditional deep dish that's not as doughy but that's just a matter of preference. The ingredients here were fresh, they don't used canned tomatoes which is splendid. As with all authentic Chicago style pizzas, the waiting time will be long since they have to bake the crust to a nice golden brown.  Getting the buffalo wings as appetizers in the meantime is a solid move. They were delicious and it certainly made the wait for the pizza more bearable by chowing down some delicious wings. They have a good selection of craft beers too which is nice. As a few people in our group were San Diegans, we had to go with a pitcher of our beloved Ballast Point Sculpin. Service was friendly and efficient as well. We were there until past closing at 2am and they did not rush to kick us out. They provided prompt and courteous service even though we were literally the last customers of the night. Overall, Pequod's definitely earns their reputation as being one of the finest deep dish pizzerias in Chicago. Although I prefer Lou Manati's, I am not at all surprised that many people have Pequod's ranked as the king of Chicago deep dish."
"I'm from Chicagoland suburbs, I've had every type of pizza from paisans, giordanos, Lou malnatis, home run inn, and etc. Plus to top it I've had pizza from all around the us; Connecticut which actually won an award for best pizza in America, multiple places in New York, and so on. Pequod's is hands down the beat pizza I've ever had. Even my friend whom swore against deep dish pizza saying it was gross says Pequod's is the best he's ever had as well!"
"I almost gave this a four-star review after my last couple times coming here.  It is over run with kids now and almost unbearable to eat at the bar, but the pizza here is the best deep dish I have ever eaten.  By the way, I am fat as fuck and eat a lot of pizza.  I've tried a lot of places but this one has been my favorite for the 18 years I've lived here.  Also, as much as I do bitch about it being over crowded with 12 to 21 year old meat puppets the service has always been up to the task in fixing any fuck ups on your order.   We use to call in our pizza a head of time and eat it there.  Worked like a charm for years walking into the place and the Za is on the table 5 mins after sitting down.   Don't try that now as it's a nightmare and you will be disappointed.   We recently tried this and sat there for over an hour waiting for a pizza we called in 30 mins prior.  When it finally came out the shit was fucking cold.  Another waitress/manager saw the look on our faces and stuck it back in the oven.  After 5 mins in the oven it was fucking delicious. On top of it she didn't charge us a dime for anything.I know this doesn't read like a 5 start review but honestly the pizza is that good, - just take it home."
"We called for priority seating here on a Saturday night (they don't take reservations), and still had quite the wait, but it was worth it! The food was fantastic. We ordered jalapeño poppers, which were great and only took about 10 minutes to get to our table. The pizza took longer, about 45 minutes after our already two hour long wait. But the pizza was fantastic. It's not quite true Chicago deep dish- the crust is pretty thick- but we still loved it. I'm holding back on 5 stars because service was a little chaotic. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen most of the time, and it took a while to get our waters."
"I have been to Chicago before but had never sampled the pizza from Pequod's, instead I usually opt for either Lou Malnati's or Giordano's which this place currently sits behind on Yelp. First impression I think it is fairly ranked depending on what you prefer.  PROS: - The sauce is really good and nice an peppery.- That ring on the outside is not burnt crust it's actually burnt cheese and they do that on purpose and it's amazing.CONS: - Not much cheese in the cheese layer below the sauce which surprised meAll in all it wasn't my favorite, just because I prefer a cheesier pie - but still very good. Probably rank it as a tie for second with Giordanos but for different reasons."
"First time here and coming to Chicago. Definitely heard great things about this place. I'm not a fan of deep dish, so I ordered the thin crust. Let's find out! Go Dodgers!!"
"If you are looking for the DEEP dish style Chicago is famous for, you are in the right place. One of the best in the city at what they do, Pequod's is on most locals lost of top pie. Tourists, however, are missing out. Be prepared to wait, but so worth it!"
"Well, this was a pretty solid pizza.Arrived at 6:45p on Sunday night. There was a hawks game on.  The wait was approximately an hour. We ended up finding a bar seat.  The wait for pizza was advertised at 50 minutes but ours arrived after about 35 minutes.  In the meantime we ordered a Peqoud Salad (half size), which was more than enough for 2. Also ordered a tasty 3 floyds beer. Only 4 tap selections, but at least a couple were craft. The pizza was excellent. It had melted cheese on the side edge that was a little burnt and tasty. We also got meatballs and spinach on it. Both great options."
"Very tasty pizza but for that price i would like to see more cheese. It's mostly bread and sauce. I believe their sauce and the way the cook it well done is the key. Maybe next time I go I will order extra cheese if they allow it. Therefore beware cheese lovers there is a paper thin layer of cheese on this pizza and the only way they can get away with this is because of how they caramelize the little cheese that is on there which amplifies the flavor.Also be prepared to for a possible long wait during busy hours, the restaurant is not very big."
"Recommended to me by numerous people before my trip to Chicago, and most definitely praised by locals while I was here, I was on a mission to get to Pequod's. Seriously, this girl in an UberPool we were with was talking about the usual big dogs of deep dish since we said we were from out of town, but the moment I brought up Pequod's, she yelped (haha) like there were ants down her pants.It was a group of 5 of us, so we got the large (14"") pie with pepperoni and sausage. We each had a couple of drinks so one slice was definitely enough, and two would bring you over the top. I had two :)While I still prefer the classic New York slice, I can definitely get behind the deep dish from here. The crunchiness of the crust is what sealed the deal, balancing out the gooeyness of the cheese, and the tasty (and not too salty) pepperoni and sausage. It truly tasted like they used some top notch ingredients and put a lot of love into their pies. To sum it up, there's no beating their meat! Might be fine in the back alley, though..."
"Best in town. If someone comes to visit it's the first place we go. If you think Lous is where you take someone from out of town, I feel bad for that person."
"Best. Chicago. Pizza. If you're trying to decide between Pequod's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's, Giordano's, wherever else - you gotta do Pequod's hands down."
"AMAZING. Seriously, if you are in Chicago and do not go here you are missing out. Me and my friend went here (world series weekend) on Saturday. We went on the website and requested a table for 2 at 4:30 p.m. about a week prior. When we got there we were immediately seated. I highly suggest you do that, the website claims it cuts the wait time in half. I know this place is always crowded so I was super happy when we were seated right away. We probably picked an early enough time. The place was pretty packed.When we were seated we ordered our pizza immediately (since the wait for a pizza can be up to 2 hours - ours was 2.5 hours). We also ordered fries and mozzarella sticks as apps, good choice because we were STARVING and smelling pizza and seeing people eat around you was not helping the wait. Oh boy I just wanted my pizza lol. We were told to order extra sauce, and thank the lord we listened to that kind gentleman because when our pizza came out it was AMAZING. We got a medium, extra sauce and pepperoni. I seriously am craving this pizza as I'm typing this it is that good. Any and every time I am in Chicago I will go to pequods. Seriously, it is that good and 100X better than the other chain pizza places (Giordanos and Lou Malnatis) I've tried them all and Pequods is by far the best. EVERYONE GO TO PEQUODS!"
"Everyone knows this is basically the best pizza ever. Just ask the insanely long line out the door every night. It's thick, hot, the veggies are fresh, it's not too saucey, and it's absolutely worth the wait. Perfection. The kind of spot you will insist upon to out of towners so they can experience joy for once in their lives."
"Trust in the crust, not in the service.Pequod's is considered by many (the vivacious LeAnn P among them) to serve one of Chicago's best pizzas, and after a visit this past weekend I can believe the hype.It takes either a very special pie or a very special lady to get me to eat deep dish (as I much prefer thin crust); in this case it was a little bit of both.  Fortunately we came early enough in the evening before great masses crowded the place, so getting a table was no problemo.Knowing that their Chicago-style was legendary (3,000 reviews on Yelp, god damn!), we hastily asked for a 10"" pan with pepperoni, sausage, and green peppers.  Pequod's is famous for their burnt cheese crust, which comes out black and delicious (much like Drake).Thirty minutes seems like an eternity when you're craving the 'za, but eventually it arrived and we dug in with little hesitation.  Great sauce, plentiful toppings, and a blackened cheesy pan crust had me singing their praises.  It was incredible, folks.  I'd say my expectations were high and even they got surpassed.  I still feel weird eating pizza with a knife and fork, but when it's as good as Pequod's I could honestly care less.Bread = 4.5Circuses = 2.5The 'za was as good as the service was bad.  But in what way?Our server Alex greeted us, got in our pizza order and brought us drinks, after which she pretty much vanished.  When our deep dish finally arrived, a different girl brought it out and sliced it for us, who later also brought us more refreshments......so where did Alex go?  Maybe she quit.  Perhaps a family emergency?  Noooooope!  Turns out, she was just chillin' at the bar, hobnobbing with some locals while enjoying a glass of wine and a slice.  Apparently, her shift had ended.  Areyouf*ckingkiddingme?I had no words.  None to describe how flabbergasted I was that our original waitress totally bailed on us without warning.  A quick ""hey, I'm closing out, (new waitress) will be taking over for me"", would have sufficed but we didn't even get that much.  When the check came, I wanted to confirm that Alex wouldn't get diddly squat tip-wise for abandoning her customers, but as the server was listed as ""CZ01"" (whatever the sh*t THAT means), I've really no way of knowing.The men's bathroom had a ton of graffiti in it, but not the cool kind like at Emporium Barcade where it's intentional in an edgy sort of way.  Here, it was a normal, clean-ish bathroom that a bunch of people straight up vandalized. lolIt's not that I wouldn't want to return here-- because the pan pie is really, REALLY good --but since everybody and their grandma claims that they're ""Chicago's best pizza"" I feel obligated to try them all before making a 2nd lap around town.Get here early to avoid the swarm of people, and pray that your server doesn't randomly disappear."
"My sister & I came here Monday afternoon and we made it in time for the lunch special. We tried Lou Manalti's the other night, but we weren't amazed. On the other hand, Pequod's took our breath away.The Chicago Lunch Special is Monday - Friday 11 AM to 3 PM. You get a 7"" cheese pan pizza and soda (no refills) for $4.95. If you want to add any other toppings, there is a charge per topping. For two lunch specials (w/ toppings), the bill came out to be around $12.One thing that I hate about Chicago deep dish pizza is the wait, but Pequod's was worth it. The crust was buttery and flakey. The sauce was amazing and it was cheesy (but not too cheesy). I highly recommend going here as the flavor is outstanding."
"Not much else to say other than the food here is awesome.   The parking is a little off, but the food definitely made up for this.  My wife and I will be back sooner rather than later."
Pequod's has really gotten down how to get the perfectly crispy crust. If you love a crispy crust then you will love Pequod's.The taste is great and is a good location for deep dish pizza.The only thing I will add is that they could be a bit more generous with the toppings. I could count the pieces of ham that received on a pizza on 1 hand. Most other pizza locations overload the pizza with toppings.
"The hype is definitely real. So this is how Chicagoan does pan pizza. Buttery flakey crust with nice and zesty tomato sauce. The caramelized crust is also really good. Here, you  build your own pan pizza, base comes with just cheese and sauce so add additional as you wish. Weekdays lunch special is probably the best deal. For $4.95, you get your own personal pan cheese pizza then add whatever toppings. Weekday lunch service is pretty quiet so if you're a tourist then I would recommend coming during this time."
"Another Chicago staple.. I have been a customer for more than 25 years..., the crusted cheese sided pizza is like no other.. casual, friendly, family chi town must!!!!"
Classic Chicago deep-dish pizza. Surprisingly inexpensive for how filling it is. Bring your A-game appetite.
"Wow! What a terrific pizza rest, the personal size pizza is wonderful, the chicken wing were crispy and delicious, the service was fat, polite and friendly! We were lucky we didn't have to wait ! We will definitely go there again and again!"
Place is much bigger than I thought.  We were seated on the 2nd floor. Needless to say even our big group of 23 people were quickly seated even though the place was so busy on a Thursday night.  It was my first time but we came here due to one person in our group saying it's the best deep dish pizza ever.  Well it was very good but it's not the best :). We ordered 5 large pan pizzas from regular cheese to sausage garlic to pepperoni garlic.  I'm so full as I ate 4 pieces.  The waitress was nice.  Don't know about the prices since I didn't pay.  My only complaint was the place was loud and we had to yell to talk and hear each other even though we were sitting so close to each other.  I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.
This is one of the best deep dish pizza places in Chicago. I usually get the sausage green pepper and black olive and it never disappoints. But whatever you get is good.
"My most favorite thick pizza in the city. That crust is delicious and pizza is just amazing and worth the wait. Skip the typical bar food appetizers, they really aren't that great. But the pizza makes up for it. Just plan to wait for the pie."
"Forget Giordano's or Lou's, Pequod's definitely has the best deep dish in town. Whenever we have friends coming in from out of town wanting some deep dish we always take them here. Main reason we don't come here more often for our pizza cravings is because the wait is usually 1-2 hours on any night of the weekend.  The staff is friendly and the food is great. Definitely order some appetizers since you'll have to wait about 30-45min for the pizza. I'd recommend the breaded mushrooms and bruschetta."
"This is my favorite pizza in the city! The staff is INSANE about checking and double checking ID's here, which is so weird for a pizza restaurant. I've seen the waitresses drinking beer on the job too! I usually order and take home because I know the service is so poor, but god their pizza is so amazing"
"I've been eating Pequod's for years and love it! While I wish they put a little more sauce on their pizza, the overall quality and flavor is top notch! Make sure to swing by and check them out if you're in the area."
"Best deep dish in my opinion. I'm usually a thin crust type of gal but after my experience with Pequod's. Would have to say it's my top deep dish. Been here a few times whenever my friends or family visit I would take them to Pequod's and they absolutely loved it. Some even order some to go on their flight back to California. It has all the right flavors. Perfect crust. Not too hard or soft. Just about right. The last few times I was at Pequod's. I order the vegetarian, can't go wrong with just pepperoni, and also the meat lover dish. Also order a side of fries and garlic bread as well. Just to warn you if you decide to come here get ready to wait. There's always a wait here that's how good it is or if you prefer not to wait. Order to go. Or come on an off time. There were days I've came here around noon during a weekday and longest I waited was 15 mins but weekends your average wait time would be 2hrs. There's only street parking so it's hard to find if you're driving but I always uber here."
Came here on a pizza tour; this was my second time here.  Ambiance: Large and crowded place. Pizza: We had the sausage pepperoni and it was quite yummy although quite heavy (maybe because we had been at two other pizza places before that). So i suggest you come with an apettie because the slices are quite large. Staff: We didn't have much contact with the staff so cannot comment.Everyone raves about this place and I suggest you try it at least once.
"We were on the search for the best pizza in Chicago, and tonight I'm convinced we've found it. My sister is ignoring the fact she is lactose intolerant just to consume the deep dished goodness. The vibe is casual and in no way pretentious, the service was fantastic, and best of all, the food did not disappoint. Pequod's offers every comfort you would hope to find in a hometown booth."
"This is real Chicago style pizza. It's the freshest pizza that I have eaten with traditional ingredients and their own special sauce. We were recommended to come here based on our hotel. We wish they had one of these places back home. It's so good. Highly recommend visiting if you happen to be in town. If you're a local, you're one of the luckiest person in town."
"The pizza and chicken wings here are both top tier. Every time I have gone I have had to wait to be seated, which is a sign of how good they are. Because their popularity outweighs their capacity, I suggest trying to get before the dinner rush."
"Amazing deep dish pizza. Really long waits, but sitting at the bar (first come first serve, wait for a spot) always gets  the job done! There's a small one upstairs too! Haven't had to wait for one of those spots yet."
"I first heard of Pequod's on the Food Network. When I saw it, I immediately knew my first stop in Chicago. The wait wasn't as long as I expected and was seated within 20 minutes. I ordered fries for an appetizer and they came out quickly. The fries were really good and had some kind of seasoning on them to make them stand out. The pizza took awhile to come out and I expected that since it is made to order and deep dish pizza. The pizza was good  as advertised. The only downfall for my time at Pequod's was the wait to get cashed out."
"Always great, and always worth the wait. Pequod's is, in my book, serves the best pizza in the city of Chicago. If you plan on coming though, know that during peak hours will could easily have an hour or more wait until you get seated, and then another 40 minutes to an hour before you get your pizza (not because they are slow, but because the deep-ish dish pizzas they serve take a long time to make). The bar has a good selection of beer, and the service is always friendly. On my most recent visit, about 2 weeks ago, we learned that the owners of Pequod's had opened a bar next door called Whale Tale. The great thing about that place is is that when you put your name in for a seat at Pequod's, your buzzer will work next door at Whale Tale. The people over there know that you are most likely there waiting for a table, and so the service is appropriately fast. Back to Pequod's though. Sure, ambiance-wise, it's a Blackhawks bar, but the pizza is the star of the show. Their pizza is, like I said before, deep-ish dish. I usually describe it as like a halfway deep dish. Pizzas are made in cast iron skillets and there is a layer of cheese baked in underneath and around the crust giving it a perfect, crunchy, parmesan seasoning all the way around. To me that is the best part. Pizza topping selections are plentiful, and they are not shy about loading them up onto the pizza. I've never had a bad experience here, but there was only one time that I was here that I didn't have to wait less than an hour for a table (I think it was the middle of the afternoon for some reason). I can not recommend this pizza enough. You should also note that they do have priority seating that you can access and set up from home before you venture out and take your chances with the wait time. That is definitely worth looking into."
"Delicious deep dish pizza when done right. We unfortunately had severely burnt pizza the last time we have been here, alone with poor service, and incorrect bill."
"4 stars for the very accommodating and very good service...but is it worth the Michelin hype? I didn't think so (3.5 stars for the pizza). The pizza crust is good, but when you order sausage in your pizza, you expect more than a few measly bits of sausage on your pizza. Seriously. My first slice was huge but had two tiny pieces of sausage. Good on the veggies, though. The next slice, which was smaller, did not fare much better. Alas, Pequod's, you will never replace my love of Lou Malnatti's with its stick of butter in the crust and wheel of sausage. Just to be clear, I didn't expect a wheel of sausage...just an adequate amount of sausage to reflect the medium pie we ordered. *sigh* Next time I'm in town, I will go back to my favorite, or even Giordano's which is a solid second in terms of pizza. This is clearly at least a third or a fourth. I really wanted to like you!!!"
"Visited Pequod's last week. My brother, nephew, and myself came out from California. I must say, you folks in Chicago don't know how good you have it there. You cannot get pizza half this good in California unless you make it yourself. We got 2 medium pizzas, sausage and pepperoni and sausage and onion. We are 3 big eaters and still had 2 pieces left over. The carmalized crust lived up to the hype, wasn't doughy at all, sauce was fantastic, and the sausage pieces were golf ball size. I loved the fennel taste and garlic. Servers were good and kept the water and beers coming as needed. I really enjoyed the old town feeling there as well. A dinner like that in CA would cost $100+, it was only $65 there. CA really sucks, at everything!!! I'm moving."
"I'll start by saying: I'm not a fan of deep dish.  However, if I was in the rare mood for a bit, I'd say Pequods is amazing. Solid crust and good hearty sauce. Much is left to be desired on the restaurant venue appeal, didn't look pristine or clean, but I chalked it up to being a ""dive pizza joint.""  Plus, you're not eating pizza off the tables. :)"
"Not a huge fan of deep dish, however Pequod's hits the spot - way less cheese, more toppings & sauce. & the caramelized crust...! Give them a try!"
"Pequods was recommended to us by numerous people, giving it the title of ""Best Pizza in Chicago"". We were anxious to try the amazing caramelized cheese crust everyone was raving about. We arrived at Pequods on a Friday at 5 pm, thinking we would beat the dinner crowd. Upon arrival, we were told the wait time would be 20-45 minutes. After a little more than an hour, we were finally seated. We placed our order, and our waitress informed us that the pizza would take about 75 minutes. I wish they would have told us that earlier, but we decided to wait it out since we already made it this far. They weren't lying when they said 75 minutes. When the pizza finally arrived, we devoured it in less than 10 minutes. Was it amazing? Yes! Would I wait 3 hours again? Probably not. Next time, we're gonna try to avoid the weekend dinner crowd. Waiting 3 hours for a pizza is kind of ridiculous. Plus, they have a great lunch deal. Now back to the pizza. The bottom of the crust was buttery and golden, with just the right amount of crunch. The caramelized cheese crust was just how I imagined it would be. It had a nice chew to it. The ratio of bread to cheese and toppings was perfect. Not too heavy like most deep dish pizzas. I'm officially giving Pequods my vote for best pizza in Chicago.Four stars for wait time. But I guess good things come to those who wait."
"WOW!!  Had the pan pepperoni with extra cheese and it was AMAZING. The dough was light and buttery sauce was perfect pepperoni just right and the cheese crust was out outrageous. Don't forget to order the wings,  a bit small but BIG on flavor. This is definitely the pace to come for great pizza and wings!"
"Delicious.  Great crust.  Amazing flavor.  Crust is out of this world.  Deep dish pizza is flavorful and is the best deep dish pizza in chicago.  the bread, crust, cheese is out of the park.  this caramelized crust is great. the cheese is fabulous.  Awesome Pizza!"
Love this place a billion times!!!! Great pizzas!!! Velvet gorgeous voice waiter sang happy birthday. He made mr laugh so hard forget comedy clubs come here!!!!!!!awesome
"The caramelized crust on their own pizza is to die for. I know this place technically isn't deep dish, but if you're looking for some Chicago-esque pizza in the city, I try to take visitors from out of town here instead of Giordano's or lou malnatis."
"This is my favorite deep dish place in Chicago. The ingredients are fresh and delicious! You have to have the sausage, yum!"
"I've had just about every Chicago deep dish (I was born and raised in Chicago, so it's pretty hard not to try them all)I have to say, this was probably my favorite of them all.I loved the caramelized cheese on the edge of the crust, good flavor on the sausage, fresh toppings and plenty of cheese.The service was good, and although the place was extremely busy, we really didn't have to wait long for a table.  (had time for a beer at the bar)]Definitely a recommend, and in my opinion it's among the best in Chicago."
"I wanted to kick off my first trip to Chitown right with a deep dish pizza. I was originally going to go to Lou Malnati's but my well-traveled friends steered me to Pequod's which is apparently where the real Chicagans go.My group of 4 waited an hour to be seated at 8pm on a Thursday. It took close to another hour before we actually got our deep dish pie. Caesar salad (9) - Pretty basic. It was pricey considering the salad came with nothing but what tasted like packaged croutons and one lone cherry tomato.Large w/ italian beef, mushrooms, onions (30) - Chicago is know for its italian beef sandwich so I figured may as well hit 2 birds with 1 stone and get it on my pie. The pizza came piping hot and the cheese were perfectly gooey. Pequod's is known for the burnt cheese that coats the edge of the pie and that was probably my favorite part. I'm usually not big on crust and unfortunately Pequod's wasn't an exception. I like my crust to be crispier but theirs is on the doughy, airy side.Was it delicious? Hell yes. Would I wait 2 hours again? Doubtful.Should you go if it's your first deep dish experience in Chicago? Definitely."
"The only ""deep dish"" pizza I like. That carmely cheese... oh man..."
First time in Chicago and I did some research on the best deep dish pizza prior to arriving. Pequod's was first on my list. I just HAD to go. The building was so old and had such a cool vibe. They took us up these old metal stairs to the upper floor. Loved the atmosphere! We were given shabby menus that you know thousands have seen and ordered the pan pizza which they were known for. We were told it would be a 40 min wait (they also had a sign as we came in that notified customers of the wait time). We ordered their bruschetta as we waited. It was phenomenal! The pizza seemed to come quicker than we expected. IT. WAS. AMAZING! It will haunt me in a good way. Staff was great. Heard about the Whale Tale. Can only imagine how crazy this place gets during the prime season. Will most definitely be back!!!
"Best pizza in the city according to me. Love the sausage. Love the buttery crust. Deep dish is amazing l, but thin is quite good too. Definitely takes a bit to get a table sometimes, but it's worth the wait and they have good beer."
"Our fav pizza in chicago- worth the wait for the atmosphere and classic flavor. We had drinks at the whales tail next door, had deep dish. Delicious!"
"My wife and I visited Chicago for a few days last week as part of our vacation before heading south.  I had never been to Chicago, and I am a real pizza lover, so naturally I had to try as many of the top rated Chicago Deep Dish pizzas as I could while I was there.  I was able try 3 personal size pizzas.  Giordano's was ok, Lou Malnati's was really good, but Pequod's was awesome.  By far, Pequod's was the best deep dish pizza I had in Chicago!  I just wish they shipped like Lou's does."
"Came here with my friend for lunch to try another Chicago-style pizza place, since I had tried Lou Malnati's during my visit to Chicago last year. We were seated immediately upon entering. The interior is not huge; the restaurant is deep but not very wide. The atmosphere was very pub/bar like, which I did not expect. Service was friendly and our waitress was great. She said it would be about a 45-minute wait for deep dish pizza, so we tried to place our order quickly. I think the actual wait time ended up being just a little over thirty minutes though. I also ordered one slice of thin crust just to try, and added one of the ""premium toppings"" of Italian beef (apparently also very Chicago) to it. It was a big slice and not bad, but I prefer my thin crust even crunchier (think New York-style pizza, and yes, I realize that I shouldn't be expecting that while in Chicago). All of the deep dishes start off with just cheese and you customize your pie from that point after picking a size. Each additional topping costs extra, and the cost of each topping depends on the diameter of your pizza. You can also order half-toppings (I think it means it is only put on half of your pizza) and premium toppings. The deep dish was decent, but not particularly memorable in my opinion. I enjoyed the ""caramelized edges"" mentioned on the menu, but instead of the crunchy crust I was expecting, it was actually just darkened cheese which they must sprinkle along the pan's edge. I think I prefer a crunchier crust overall, which is why I usually get thin crust during the rare occasions that I eat pizza at all.I'm glad I tried Pequod's and their food is not bad, but I think Lou Malnati's better suits my tastes (just a personal opinion)."
Not a big pizza person but the pizza here is unlike anything I've ever had. The caramelized cheese makes the pizza and it is supported by great crust and sauce. Don't be afraid to order randomly off the menu the quality of food shows through all their dishes. Service is always great and thorough even when they are extremely busy. Always worth the wait.
My favorite pizza in the city. Even great the next day. Open late and delivery too (though it's best if you get it in the restaurant)
Stuff me like the bread and beer processing machine I was meant to be. I've been sauced many times at this fine establishment not only from the vast beer selection but by the never ending flow of well spiced tomato gravy.
Best fuckin pizza I ever had in my life but I have yet to visit NYC just for the record.... Don't sleep on em
"Visiting from San Diego I tried three places while in San Diego. Connies, Luminatis and this place. This place wins hands down.Ordered the deep dish with sausage jalapeño and onion. Shared a pizza with a friend for $30.Totally worth it!"
"Definitely do their ""priority seating"" thing online. Even with that, it took an hour and a half to get a table (we were quoted 30-1 hour) and then you have to wait an hour while your pizza cooks...Other than that everything about this place is amazing. The interior is cute and reminds you of any of the other Chicago pizza joints, and the waitress, while overwhelmed, was still friendly. The sausage pizza was absolutely AMAZING!!!!! I have been a die hard fan of Gino's (despite being told it's a tourist pizza, not the real deal) but I may have to change my allegiance...I had been told this was where true Chicagoans go for their deep dish, and now I totally get why. The pizza was easily some of the best I've ever had. Overall, come on an off night, cuz they aren't exactly the best with managing reservations. But no matter what the wait or price or whatever, the pizza is worth it."
"I've ordered delivery from Peaquods a couple of times in the past and had I never been to the actual restaurant, this might be a 5 star review.I feel like the longer I live in Chicago, the more I hate deep dish, but of all the deep dish places, this is one of my more preferred...It's saucy, there's a hell of a lot of toppings (so you don't feel ripped off paying $30+ for a damn pizza), and though heavy - you don't feel as terrible as you do after eating Giordanos, per say.My visit to the actual Peaquods though (and I've been twice), was kind of disappointing. The actual pizza parlor is a little reminiscent of a dive bar (similar to the feel of Pizano's on State/Gold Coast). My complaint though has to do with the waitstaff. It really seemed like they were doing the minimum. ""Can i take your order?"" ""here's your food"" ""Here's your bill."" It just took away from the deep dish pizza experience.That all being said, I still recommend Peaquod's to all my out of town friends (vs. some of the other well known deep dish chains in Chicago)."
"My best advice is to stick with the classic toppings here: sausage, peppers, onion, tomato. I'm sure there are some other delicious variations but I haven't found anything that compares.And if you have the time and a car, I highly recommend going to the Morton Grove location instead. It's like going back in time -- totally chill and different experience and you can bowl off the calories nearby."
"My favorite. Crust is unreal. Tend to overeat and say I'll never eat pizza again, but I eventually find myself coming back to Pequods."
Amazing Local deep dish with a tantalizing burnt cheese crust!  Solid sausage and sauce that's just right. This place really hits it home for me being from the Windy City. Best deep dish in Chicago
"The wait time is absurd on a weekend evening - but if you eat the pepperoni deep dish, you understand why."
Big portions and delicious. We ordered a medium pizza and were so full! I had leftovers for days. I'd definitely come back here. Such a chill setting.
"Yum! Long wait! Went at 12:45pm on a Sunday. It was packed, but we got a table for two within about 20 minutes. Our pizzas came about 45 mins after ordering (which was quicker than the expected 50-60 minutes). Got two deep dish personal pan pizzas, one pepperoni and one with pepperoni and veggies. The crust wasn't too massive (which is why I don't like Giordano's), but I didn't think it had much flavor either. The toppings were nicely cooked and there was a good ratio of sauce and cheese.Nice atmosphere, the front windows open, good selection of drinks and apps to keep you satisfied while waiting on the pizza. There must have been group seating upstairs, but the downstairs has a bar and two and four tops. Next time I'm going to pop over to the new nail place just across the street to get a quick mani while waiting!"
"Came here on a Saturday around 7:30pm and there was a two hour wait for a party of 2. Luckily the bar is open seating so my friend and I managed to find a seat in about 20minutes. We shared a small pan pizza with pepperoni and mushroom and it was delicious! They are generous with their toppings, which helps balance the thicker crust. I also really enjoyed their tomato sauce, which is surprising because I'm usually not a fan of super saucy pizzas, but the flavor was phenomenal.  I've been in Chicago a few years now and have been to all the major places. Pequod's pizza isn't what comes to mind when I think of ""deep dish"" due to the fact that it's not stuffed. Instead it's a thicker caramelized bread crust that's balanced with a generous portion of good quality ingredients. Regardless, it's a Chicago must! I really enjoyed the pizza and would definitely recommend it!"
Excellent deep dish pizza in a dive-y setting. We had a small and it was plenty for the two of us with leftovers to take home. Loved the carmelized crust. We shared the half sized house salad and that was also plenty. It was about 5 miles away from downtown so nice to get out of the downtown area for a bit on our long weekend visit. This place is legit.
"Can we talk about how, after living in Chicago for 8 years, this is still my favorite deep dish? Downside? The wait time for a table is LONG. Good thing they built a place to get drinks and bar snacks next door. It makes going here in the winter a possibility. But yes go. Great pizza!"
"During my short weekend trip to Chicago, I had the pleasure of trying 3 of (from my research) the top deep dish pizza joints in the city. Pequod's is ranked #2 for me.I highly recommend going to their website and making a reservation right away. They will text you a day before to confirm your ressie and you're set. When we walked in on a Saturday night at 7pm it was PACKKKED. The party of 2 ahead of us was given a 2.5 hour wait time. We were a party of 7 and we were seated right away. MAKE A RESERVATION.Loud, large dive bar feel. + bruschetta - Skip it. It's bland and not good at all here.+ ravioli pesto and marinara - Both were tasty, but nothing to brag about. If you're craving ravioli and want to order one, I'd say go with the pesto.+ PIZZAAAAAACRUST - their ""caramelized crust"" is their specialty and what separates them from the rest. It's basically burnt layers of cheese -- ok that doesn't sound too appetizing but trust me, it's so crunchy and SO good. TOPPINGS - You can choose your own toppings (from basic and premium lists). They say  not to pile too much on.-- Sausage and pepperoni - per our waiter's recommendation. Basic, but SO SOLID. I think would've been better with mushrooms and bell peppers.-- Bell peppers, mushrooms, and Italian beef - also per our waiter's recommendation. It was good, but the beef didn't really go well with the pizza overall. I wish we would've gotten more veggies and tried the meatballs instead.I think if we weren't starving and did more research on which toppings to choose, we would've enjoyed our pizza way more. Nonetheless, Pequod's is still a MUST on your hit-list for Chicago eateries and we're glad we got to enjoy it with little hassle/wait."
Pequods is my favorite deep dish in the city. Thinking about the crispy cheese on the crust makes my mouth water. It's pretty reasonably priced too.
"We got there at 11:30! Thank goodness! Within in 15 minutes we would've had to wait 2 hours...we had a group of 10.In summary, excellent Chicago pizza!My family argues between Lou's and Giordanos... but we unanimously agree this is the best!The cheesy carmelized crust is to die for!My favorite is the pepperoni, then the sausage, then the cheese.I like mine saucy... so definitely the meat pizzas were the most saucy.Excellent sauce and high grade meats! The Pequod salad was also very good! Overall... worth the drive from downtown!"
Probably best CHICAGO style pie I've had. I don't get it often so many experience has only been lous and giordanos
"Best chitown deep dish pizza I have ever had... from the sauce, the freshness of toppings to the crispy crust and the flavor was absolutely unique and fantastic."
"Chicago. Day 7. Pizza.Deep dish crust - 5/5Toppings (pepperoni + sausage) - 3/5Toppings (italian beef + ground beef) - 4/5Overall, best deep dish I've had. ""As good as it gets."""
"I was super stoked to give this place a try--so much so that I decided to wait the 1hr20min wait on a Friday night to get a table for five (not to mention, the 50min it takes for pizzas to come out).Two hours and ten minutes after my arrival, my small pan pizza (w/ pineapple, mushrooms, and sausage) arrived before me. I took a bite, and it was great! ...The thing is, it was only great. It wasn't mind boggling-ly good. Honestly, I prefer Lou's to this. I was sorta let down. That said, I will say it is definitely filling, which is satisfying; also, the caramelized crust was a nice extra touch to the pizza. Yummy food, but there's no way I'd come here again if I have to wait an extended amount of time. It's simply not stellar enough for so long a wait. Maybe I'll come check it out on a weekday during the day, and score that sweet lunch special they have."
"Don't go here on the weekend, the wait is ridiculous! Or plan on having four hours to hangout!If you've ever been to Detroit and enjoyed an amazing Detroit style pizza such as Loui's or Buddy's or for those that haven't made it there but may have had Jets! You know that it's all about the crust! This place has the crust dialed in! Its that Carmelized cheese baked to the edge crust that makes the whole slice worth it! This pizza was great it was like the best of both worlds Chicago meets Detroit and I loved it! I'll be back someday for 2nds!A little tip would be don't waste your time with veggies on these pizzas! Sausage maybe some pepperoni is the best way to enjoy! Get a salad too, very good!"
"We got delivery expecting it to be a little less than stellar for the travel. We were WRONG! The salad was so cold and crisp. We received a different dressing than requested (homemade Italian), but it was so good that I'm calling it a happy accident. The pizza itself _is_ really bready, especially in the center, but the intensely caramelized cheesy crust makes for such a lovely flavor and texture counterpoint--also the onions on our pie were a welcome bit of crunch and sweetness. Totally unique and totally delicious!"
"Unfortunately it's kind of easy to get tired of deep dish pizza sometimes as a Chicagoan, but this place never disappoints. The wait time can be a bit unbearable at times but if you have the patience, it's for sure worth it, and it's nice that even on a Sunday at like 11 p.m. it still feels busy, not like you're at a place where they're waiting to chase you out.Tips: go for the deep dish that has the full layer of sausage meat in it, and try the WINGS. You've been waiting to get a table for a while, and the food is going to take even longer once you're seated, and you won't be sad you ordered the wings while you're waiting.Delivery is pretty great, too, but don't order when you're hungry as it usually takes a while (90 min or more, sometimes 2 hours) even if you're close by. The food almost always still shows up hot though."
"Hands down the best Pizza in Chicago! Burt perfected it at Pequod's! I would highly recommend if you only have one chance to try Chicago Pizza, you go here!"
"First time trying Chicago Deep Dish, definitely met my expectations. We ordered the a small and a medium for 5 people and it was the perfect amount. The pizza was perfectly cooked all the way through. Very heavy and filling. Had to wait 30 mins to get seated and around an hour for the pizza. Time expectations were given early and was on time. Food was 5/5 but service was 3/5. Good local feel! Would go again if I am in the area!"
"Probably the best deep dish in Chicago. Portions are great, atmosphere is casual, and the pizza is super flavorful. I tried some cold leftover pizza and it was bursting with flavor. Caramelized crust sets it apart from others and it's honestly fantastic. Prices are also incredibly reasonable. Highly recommend"
"It really is worth the wait. Really.We waited 50 minutes for a large pan pizza with extra cheese, sausage, mushrooms, and onions. It was divine. We also really enjoyed the fried zucchini appetizer.This is what deep dish should be."
"Love Pequods it's the best deep dish pizza in Chicago!! I always get garlic, tomato and spinach on it!"
"Noisy, raucus, crowded--but with terrific pizza. Alas, the waitress forgot our salad, but who really needs salad when the pizza is this good?"
"Pequod's over Lou Malnati's or Giordano's.I found this place during my first year in Chicago, and having been to Lou Malnati's or Giordano's in and around the city, I recommend out of towners go here.When I'm bringing friends around town, I usually bring them here for the $4.95 lunch special, which includes a 7"" personal cheese and a fountain drink. For a dollar more you can add a topping. I'm not sure if I'm misremembering, but they used to consider a beer (Miller Lite?) as a fountain drink, but they haven't continued that as of recent visits.The wait for the pan takes around 30-40 minutes, so I kill that time by hanging out with the friend(s) I've brought here. The pizza is enough to fill you up, and it's just a quality crust with the right amount of crunch, give, butteriness, and burn.I'm not particularly a follower of ball game or other sports, so take everything I say now with a grain of salt: the sports vibe here is as Chicago as it gets without having to go to Wrigleyville.Love this place."
"Good deep dish pizza and wings. Crust on the pizza is what makes this pizza stand out from any other Chicago style deep dish. The sauce is a bit sweeter with ample amount of toppings, I got jalapeños and pineapple...jalapeños are very spicy so had to pick off a few of them as there were lots on the small personal size pizza. Bbq sauce on the wings was sweet and juicy. Good quick service. Would recommend!"
"This pizza really is as good as everyone says, but do yourself a favor, skip the thin crust and go straight for the deep dish.  The thick cheese crust is awesome and they don't skimp on the toppings.  To avoid the longer-than-you-can-believe-lines, call ahead and that should cut your wait in half."
"Ali and I take family and friends here who've never had deep dish... It's our go-to, just as Johnnie's is our go-to for Italian beef. Pequod's is always always packed! When here with a group of five we waited one hour to get a seat and one hour to get our pizza, and it was the best!! I love the caramelized crust! You better not call it burnt or I will pull all my hair out right in front of you. Ali and I don't go to deep dish joints EVER, unless it is to entertain guests - and when we do go we always order the small pan with onion, mushroom, pineapple, and anchovy. Even the small is massive. One slice of this stuff is like three regular slices of pizza. This ish is definitely a casserole, and they don't skimp on the toppings. When here entertaining a friend most recently we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table, and 45 for our pizza. Not bad! They also sat us in the back booth with the comfy seats. Every single seat in the house was full and there was a huge crowd waiting for a spot when we left. If you can handle the crowd and the wait times you'll have the best deep dish in Chicago."
"It has all the feel of a friendly neighborhood restaurant with my favorite deep dish pizza in town. The interior is cozy and warm and the building is multi-story.The signature of the deep dish here is the cheesy, caramelized crust. It looks blackened and burnt, but it tastes delicious! The crust is actually not all that thick or bready despite it being deep dish. The pizza sauce has a nice sweetness to it that's not too overwhelming and the cheese is delicious. As for toppings, we had Italian sausage and spinach. I would certainly recommend the sausage."
"Pequod's serves up the quintessential Chicago deep dish experience. It's a fairly small restaurant in a residential neighborhood across the street from a movie theater. We got extremely lucky as there was practically no wait on a Sunday night. Our server was great, super friendly and willing to accommodate changes to our order. The pizza took about an hour to get ready, so definitely order some appetizers. Their cheesy garlic bread dipped in marinara is delicious and extremely hot, so give yourself a minute or two before you devour it. I highly recommend the wings as well. I personally prefer the barbecue wings over the buffalo, which has a nice kick if that's what you're feeling. As for the pizza, there's no doubt about the ""deep dish"" part. It's thicker than the ones served at Lou's. One slice can count as two slices of a normal pizzas. You get to pick your own toppings. We ordered a large and I'd say it would easily feed 5 hungry adults. Overall I was very happy with the experience and would come back!"
"This place exemplifies a great pizza experience. The pizza I get is what they are known for, Chicago Style! Yet the do it a little different the dough is so thick unlike other Chicago style pizzas the toppings are mostly on top. While it may not sound great it is because it makes the pepperoni always done perfectly! If you don't like it crunchy the pepperoni just underneath will suit you. I have tried other toppings and from the ground beef , mushrooms, peppers and sausage everything maintains it's flavor but yet doesn't over shadow the sauce that is great in its own right. Now the very edge of the pizza comes out burnt so don't be alarmed!! This is a must visit for anyone in the area! They usually have a 45min. Wait on the weekends so I am a fan over the personal pizza lunch special!!"
"I'm a New Yorker and swear by NYC pizza. NOTHING is better. However I will say Pequod is nothing to play with in the pizza game. I came here looking for the best deep dish. I didn't have time to experience all the deep disp spots so I looked at a few reviews and narrowed my search down to two places Lou Malnati's and Pequod. Don't waste your time, money and calories going anywhere else but Pequod for deep dish. 4 stars because it's not NYC pizza."
"I don't even like deep dish or meat and I tried both and it was outstanding. This blows Lou's away, easily!"
"Look, you either love it or you think its nothing special. The ingredients are great. Sure, sometimes I wish it had a little more sauce, though I've got enough to go around ;) But what sets it apart from the rest is the crust. The caramelized crust makes eating it a delight. It might be the best part. At the other well known Deep Dish Pizza chains in Chicago, more often then not, people don't eat the crust, and that's just sad and wasteful. Shame on them for making dry, thick, no-fun crust. Stomach real-estate is scarce. Fill your core with good crust. ""Pequod's .. it's crust-have pizza."" - me"
"Each time i've been here, the quoted wait time has been longer than it actually has been to get a table. I really enjoyed the pizza. I would describe this pizza as more ""bready"" than some of the other pizza institutions around town, but it was quite good. The pizza is well assembled and if you were really bold you could even eat it with your hands because the sauce and toppings are not overflowing like other establishments. This is a solid pie, I would put it in its own league!"
"Best Chicago pizza! I'm in from Miami during hurricane Irma and I am coming to my pizza spot! This place never disappoints me! Start delivery to Bay Harbor Island, Florida! It's the crispy crust, the oozy cheese and the sweetness of the sauce and all the sausage, peppers and onions!"
"When I have friends come in from out of town they always want deep dish. Everyone will tell you to try this or that. Here's the thing. Pequod's is my favorite deep dish in the city. I don't usually eat deep dish, just because it is a lot to handle. But this is where I go when I do. The way they cook the pizza in the cast iron truly traps in the best flavoring. Just writing this is making me want to go back there again."
"This is it. Real Chicago, not one of those tourist traps.If you don't want to wait 2 hr for done in call for pick up 1hr"
"Let's imagine you live 1500 miles away and you see this joint on TV and think 'that looks great, but I'll never be there'.  Then, just a week later you are in an Uber heading to this joint. What a treat this place was - the pie was just as it was on TV and maybe even a little better. It takes a while, but they tell you that up front and well worth the 40 minutes.  In that 40 minutes, we had a couple beers and a chicken wing appetizer. The wings were very well done with ample sauce. When the pizza arrived, I immediate regret ordering a medium for two people. It could feed 6. The browned cheese on the outside of the crust was the highlight. I coulda eaten just that. The place is great. Good atmosphere, only one moderately grumpy employee (who isn't at 10:30 on a Thursday night?), clean and great food. Eat here, you'll love it just like I did."
One of my favorite deep dish pizza spots in Chicago and I live above a Lou Malnoti's (ps I still love you Lou). Of you're from out of town this place is a must to complete your Chicago pizza experience. Bon appetite!
"You definitely have to wait in order to get a table, esp.on weekends. We were 5 people and waited for 1.5h. They have a good selection of pizzas; generally, you choose all the ingredients and size. So we ordered medium size with all vegetables, and another with meat. Too much dough at the bottom in comparison with Giordano's pizza. I would rate their pizza 4/5, was not ""wow"" personally."
One of my favorite pizza places in Chicago. A little different with the burnt cheese crust but it's delicious. They always have a long wait if you go around lunch time or dinner time. I usually get the pepperoni with mushrooms or hot peppers. They do have some limited beer selections. I would recommend anything really on the menu. I also like my pizza well done which add a crisp taste to the crust.
I only managed to eat one slice because it was so filling. The wait is long but well worth it.
"Pequod's is just the best. You know you're getting a quality pizza each time, and that you'll have to wait a long time to be seated. Favorite pan pizza in Chicago."
"I'm a big fan of deep dish pizza and Pequod's is definitely one of my favorites. I'm used to the suburban location, which is a lot smaller, but this location was larger and much, much busier, which was expected. Went here on a Sunday night around 7:30p with a pretty large group (11 people).  There wasn't a problem getting seated, which was nice, but we were a bit crammed in a round booth table. The server was really nice and very patient as she took our drink orders right away as we waited for some of the others to get to the restaurant. There wasn't that big of a selection but they had a decent sized list. We ordered two orders of the appetizer platters which was just enough for our large group. I really liked the fried zuchinni, but wasn't that big of a fan of the jalepeno poppers. We ordered 2 large and 1 medium pan pizza. It took about maybe an hour to arrive but it was worth it!. We had one with Italian beef and giardenera, another with just sausage, and the last with mushroom and spinach. Everyone enjoyed all of them! The crust was crisp to perfection. Definitely enough for 10 people! There were some leftovers but not a lotFor first timers--I recommend ordering an appetizer since pizzas take a while to cook, and if you are ordering the deep dish pizzas, go no more than 2 toppings, as it might get a bit overwhelming."
"I love, love, love their pizza here. I'm not a traditional Chicago style pizza person. This place gets packed on the weekends and during Blackhawks games so either be prepared to wait to eat in or order ahead of time to take out.Their pan style pizza (I recommend to order with extra sauce) is amazing. Haven't tried much else on their menu but it all looks good."
"Pequod's was pretty busy around 7:30pm on a Sunday night. We had a party of 11 and we were seated right away which I think was pure luck lol because this place is always packed. We were able to sit in the corner booth by the fireplace which was a nice touch cause it was pretty cold on that side. We ordered 2 appetizer combos which had breaded mushrooms, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and jalapeno poppers. I liked all the options and it was cooked perfectly. I would def order this again to have a taste of 4 appetizers. I also think it was around $10 for a platter which isn't bad. We got 3 pizzas. 1 large sausage pizza, 1 large veggie (mushroom and spinach), and 1 large half giardiniera and italian beef. There was a confusion when we ordered the last pizza because we wanted the full pizza to be italian beef but only half of it have giardiniera on top. All the pizzas were delicious and cooked great. It did take like 45-1 hour for the pizzas to come, but it was well worth it. I'm very loyal to Lou's, but Pequod's is pretty up there. If you're visiting Chicago, you should def check this place out."
So delicious! We came here for lunch on a Sunday around 2pm. There was no wait for a table for three of us. Or server was friendly. We ordered a thin crust and deep dish. They brought out the thin that was done just a few minutes before the deep dish so we could get started enjoying it. We got sausage pepperoni and both were very tasty!
"Best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago. That's my opinion, but you need to try this pizza before you disagree. Let me explain my stance:They get the ratio of ingredients right. Dough, there's a lot of it, but it's light and fluffy. It's the backbone of the pizza but it doesn't dominate. It's delicious and hot and bready, and it won't feel like cement in your stomach. The crust is still sturdy and crispy.Cheese, less cheese than the other deep dish slices, in the best way. You taste it, but you're not chomping through puddles of grease in a cheesy swamp. The burnt ends are a culinary treasure, chewy with sweet, intense flavor, makes the crust the best bite.Sauce, the best standalone sauce in the city. Sweet! You can taste the tomato. It's not too acidic. Thick and applied liberally. Toppings, so generous. If you order pepperoni (the best topping) you get a tight weave of pepperoni that covers the whole pie. There's no other pizza place that borderlines too much pepperoni, it's a wonderful problem to have. In summary, the construction of this pizza makes it the best in the city. It's okay to disagree with me, but not before you've tried it.Order in and out are both challenging experiences. There's usually a pretty heft wait if you're dining on the weekends. Navigating the crowded entrance way to pick up your takeout order is pretty frustrating. Whatever."
"Delicious pizza, authentic and old school setting. The perfect experience for my first Chicago deep dish. Really enjoyed the pizza and ambiance here. Service was a bit slow, but to be expected as it was Saturday afternoon and the place was packed! Will definitely be back for another round of tasty pie."
"This is easily one of the best pizza places in the country. I came here as a stop from business trip. I ordered the personal pan 10 inch pizza with sausage Canadian ham/baconAnd mushrooms. The crust of the pizza was probably one of the most unique features of food that I have ever tried. You could tell that a lot of thought and effort went behind perfecting the the sauce, don't get me started on the sauce. You could tell that it was authentic and homemade. The sausage was definitely something worth writing home about it looked like a quarter size the meatball but it tasted like a perfection  the textures of the meat to bread were excellent and blended very well with the homemade sauce of the Pizza. I think overall the most unique thing about the meal was the sauce and meats. I'm from Philly so take this with a grain of salt, the best cheesesteaks/Philadelphian food can be found at Hilton in Philly"
"If you are up by Wrigley, you need to stop in this pizza place! My favorite pizza in Chicago is Lou Malnati's but this is a very close second. We ordered a thin crust and a pan pizza and they were both awesome. The topping were free and the pizza had the perfect proportions of cheese, toppings and sauce. The service was excellent. We had a waitress that was training and she did a great job. As others have said, parking is difficult so we took an Uber."
"This establishment made me feel like I was a local Chicagoan, especially after working up an appetite at Goose Island brewery right before!Their caramelized crust won me over & just had to put pepperoni, jalapeños & pineapple on it to seal the deal. I tried Lou Malnati's too & thought it was good, but I found that THIS is the Chicago pizza experience people talk about!"
"Best Chicago style pizza by a long shot (I will admit I am a fan of Giordano's as well, but this one takes the cake).  Great balance between topping,s cheese, and crust (which has caramelized cheese on it BTW!).  The only down side is it gets PACKED and is difficult to get into most times.....because it's so great.  I would definitely recommend ordering a pie to carry out if you don't want to deal with the hassle of waiting forever to get in."
"Best pizza in Chicago, hands down. Only complaint is the long wait. But so worth it. I love the burnt cheesy crust. Apps are good too:)"
"Went to the restaurant on a busy Sunday night but it only took about 20 minutes for a friend and I to get a table. Ordered an order wings, cheese garlic bread, and pepperoni/sausage small pan. The wings were pretty good to me. The waitress accidentally brought us the half order instead of the whole order. The garlic bread came much later and it was only ok. It was mostly cheese and bread, I didn't taste much garlic. The pizza was great! I'm not usually a fan of pan because it's too much crust but I didn't feel that way at Pequod's. The pizza was loaded with toppings. The edges were crispy and cheesy. And the crust was not too overpowering. Sauce was good too."
"Excellent Chicago style deep dish pizza, with their uniquely delicious sauce and 'burned' cheese crust! Make sure to ask for extra sauce either on your pizza, or even on the side. Vegetarian and meat options are both fantastic. There's a bit of a wait usually, even in the middle of the afternoon, so be prepared, or call ahead and get your table bumped to the top of the qu when you arrive! And you can put your order in while you wait, they just won't put the pizza in the oven until you're seated."
"Love this pizza, one of my favorites in the city.  The wait is absolutely the worst thing about this place but they will usually take your pizza order while you're waiting for a table so it moves pretty quickly.  The lunch special used to be better but it's still pretty good."
"Did someone say Chicago deep dish pizza? Obviously when visiting Chicago, you have to get pizza. SO my cousin and his friends took me here. We were able to get in right away. I heard it can get very busy. We started off with a salad because we were pretty hungry and knew it would a little bit for the pizza to cook. We got a deep dish pizza with olives, green peppers, pepperoni and I don't even remember what else. All I know is that it was amazing!Seriously one of the best slices of pizza I have had. So good. I wish I could go back now! Pizza is my jam and I wasn't disappointed."
"First deep dish pie in Chitown. A line outside the door, but I was only one person, so got to quickly get a seat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon.Ordered the Cheesy Garlic Bread appetizer to start ($4ish) since the pizza takes forever to get in. Two large cylindrical slices of bread topped with gooey melted cheese and a strong taste of garlic. Probably not the best idea to order before trying to down an entire deep dish. Main course was a 10"" with mushrooms ($13ish). Gobs of marinara sauce soaking thick bready goodness. Very filling pizza though I did not like the chewy burnt crust along the edges (marinara didn't help there). Could barely move after all said and done.Service here is friendly despite the hangry crowds. Great pizza though wouldn't wait forever for it."
"I really want to give this place 5 stars because so many people say it is the best pizza in the city.  We tried this place twice and got thin crust as well as pan and it was just ""meh"".  I really don't see what the big deal is about this place but I live down the street and it is always packed with people outside.  Now, i am not saying this place is bad at all, I guess it just didn't hit my taste buds correctly.  But...... Living in the city as long as I have, I will tell you whenever anyone is asked about their favorite pizza in the city, they always say Pequod's.  So I will definitely give you props for that!!!!"
"I've only tried deep dish pizza twice (NorCal and LA) prior to Pequods. I normally prefer thin crust pizza, but Pequods definitely had me thinking twice! The restaurant looks small but tucked on the side is a staircase for additional seating upstairs. We came at an off time (around 3:30pm) and were seated immediately. By around 5pm, the place was completely packed with a wait to be seated. Appetizer Combo ($9.95): Deep fried zucchini, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, and mushrooms! 2 sauces accompany the plate of deep fried goodness: ranch and the most perfect cocktail sauce. I enjoyed all but the jalapeno poppers which had a tad too much cheese. Perfect appetizer to share.Medium Pan Pizza ($15.50): Toppings range from $1.45-$3.50 each for add on. We added sausage & pepperoni to our beautiful 6 slice deep dish pizza. I absolutely LOVE crust on a pizza and Pequods delivered. Crispy cheese crust on the edges and perfectly cooked crust on the bottom of the pizza. CRUST HEAVEN. I can't stop thinking about it.Pequods is out of the city for those who visit Chicago but it's worth the trip."
I wish I did not have to fly form California for the most delicious treat of my life. The pizza was recommended by a local. The two of us ate enough for 3 because we knew we could not come back and it was so good.
"Been for the lunch special many times and convinced this is the best pizza deal and my favorite pizza experience in Chicago. I'm not a fan of ""Chicago Deep Dish"" but I love Pequods deep dish with caramelized crust!!!"
"The lines can be insane, it's more chill at their Morton Grove location.It's the caramelized crust, that's what it is."
"Great pizza, solid vibe and a good beer selection! Takes a little while for the deep dish to come out, but they warn you right when you walk in. Solid place to come watch a game"
Delicious pan-style pizza with a butter crispy crust. Lunch special is amazing for a pizza and a drink for cheap!
"A Chicago staple for sure! Pizza is always delicious and hot, service is always great too! They also have a nice little bar with a good variety of beers on tap. Usually a long wait to dine in or carry out so don't wait till you're hangry."
"Chicago's best pizza. Worth the wait, if you don't want to wait go early or carry out."
"Nothing I can say that hasn't been said already. The crust is amazing. Great sausage, lots of cheese. Definitely an occasional treat."
"If you're going to get deep dish in Chicago, you go to Pequod's. Sure, it's not in a tourist trap like Mag Mile or Navy Pier, but I think you should ask yourself at what lengths will to go to in order to obtain premium pizza. If your answer is a couple blocks. There's no hope for you. Just kidding, you'll be fine, but you're missing out. Grab an Uber, take the bus, idc just go to Pequod's."
"My boyfriend and I were in town for spring break and came here for dinner on a Sunday night after seeing a movie. It was a little past 6pm and there was already a good crowd outdoors waiting to be seated. Thankfully as a party of two, we were seated immediately. I had read about Pequod's on a list of top spots for Chicago pizza, but eating here was completely unplanned, which made it all the better.We ordered a small pepperoni and sausage pizza with cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer. We didn't expect the garlic bread to literally be two slices of bread with cheese and garlic on top. We could have done without it, but since it takes an hour for the pizza to be made, it was nice to have something to chew on.My recommendation is to come hungry! A small pizza is more than enough for two in my opinion. The crust was super crispy and the sauce was sweeter than expected but still really great. They were very generous with the toppings. We ate half and took the other half to go and honestly we loved it even more the next morning after heating it up."
"BEST PIZZA EVER.I genuinely don't know what else to say about this place other than the three words posted about. For the first time, I am speechless about what I ate. I got the deep dish pizza. It looks burnt at first but they actually line the baking sheet with cheese and so it's just cooked cheese. It's delightful and brilliant. Beware, it is also so so filling."
Best Deep Dish in Chicago!!! Bit of a wait which is what you want to see at a place like this.  The pizza was out of this world and reasonably priced
"Best deep dish in Chicago, hands down.The wait is a little crazy (especially coupled with the fact that we didn't get to pre-order our pizza like we did at Lou Malnati's) and the space itself is a little too cozy for me (brushed elbows with more strangers than I cared to), but staff is friendly and the pizza is absolutely worth the wait.Everything about this pizza is life. From the crust to the sauce to the cheese to the toppings, everything balanced out perfectly. I found the sauce at Lou Malnati's to be a bit too acidic for my tastes, but that was not the case at Pequod's.Would 100% return for deep dish if I visit Chicago again."
One of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago and it's worth the wait. It's usually about an hour or more wait but with good reason. Call ahead earlier in the day and get your name on the list. Once you check in you can wait it out over some great cocktails next door at the drinking bird. Cheers!
"Great pizza! Had been hearing about it from other people so was curious to give it a try. I liked the option to add on so many different toppings - we were feeling particularly ""adventurous"" so we got anchovies on half of the pizza, and it was SO good. The deep dish here is definitely really yummy, although I must say that I'm not very good at telling similar foods part so I couldn't really tell you how it was different from Lou's. Maybe slightly less cheesier?? Idk. But regardless I would say it was definitely great!"
"Best pizza in Chicago.  When I have guests in from out of town, this is where we go for deep dish.  Eat here, you will be happy with your decision."
"Love this place it's the ""stuff"" best deep dish ever!!!! Can't wait to get some again the la escarole is amazing as well. Call in an Day ahead of time!!!!!!"
"Getting deep dish in Chicago was a no brainer for me during my first trip to the city. With so many choices and opinions, it was hard to choose which one to try. After some recommendations and online reviews, we decided to try Pequod's. I was pretty much sold when I heard 'caramelized cheese crust' (a specialty of theirs). For appetizers, my friends and I got the cheesy garlic bread which is super cheesy (!!) with the right amount of garlic and butter, it was a great way to trigger our appetite while waiting for the pizza. I've been warned by locals that the pizza at Pequod's is delicious but not the best representation of a Chicago-style 'deep dish' pizza, and I can see why. The crust is best described as a thick crust and the pizza itself was not the ""so deep you'll get lost in the ooey gooey layers of melted cheese and toppings"" kind of deep dish. Because of this, my boyfriend was not too impressed. I, on the other hand, thought it was pretty good and would have no problem returning (but maybe after trying other deep dish spots). What made this pizza truly stand out and worth trying is the caramelized cheese crust. The cheese added a nice texture and salty/cheesy flavor to the dish. Overall, the pizza is a solid 4 and the crust, 5 -- I mean, who doesn't love burnt cheese?"
"So this was a pretty good deep dish. I found it very annoying that they don't call their pizzas what they are- calling it a pan pizza when it's clearly not. Anyway, the crust is probably the best I've ever had, but the filling left much to be desired, nothing special, at all. However, overall it was an enjoyable deep dish pizza."
Their pizza is famous in Chicago! Burnt caramel crust and delicious sauce. Their lunch specials are amazing too!
"As a native New Yorker eating New York pizza in New York and obviously being a New Yorker I want to say this pizza was good but I most certainly cannot. This pizza was absolutely the worst,(a solid 4/5 because I'm a New Yorker) my ego cannot concur enough with my taste buds.  Original Deep dish was a solid 4/5, thin crust was clearly also a 4/5. Beer selection was great. Ambiance was very fun, family friendly and casual.  I enjoyed the garden salad as my appetizer.The Staff were friendly and accommodating.  I bothered them a lot for multiple beer runs, pizza slices and a plethora of odd request like their phone numbers and if they wanted to go out on any dates to no avail which left them to clearly give them 4 stars.In all honesty this place was awesome.  Food environment and everything was on point. Hope you guys enjoy your meal here.Still not better than NY pizza though."
"Chicago deep dish pizza.  My first bit of advice is... to listen to your server.  We ordered 2 of the large special pizzas (for 7 people) and salad.  Way too much food, so we had the next mornings breakfast!  Very good deep dish pizza.  The atmosphere was fun, with TV's tuned into local sports.  We lucked out with a little round table for our party with room for a high chair for #7.  It was perfect.  The last bit of advice is....you can pre-order a deep dish pizza.  I wish I had know this information."
"You know how Pizza hut was actually just deep fried pizza, but no one wanted to face that fact, so we just built them next to K Marts and stopped going? Well this crust is cheesey, and fried and delicious. The pizza is good. Solid pizza. But you go for the crust. Its a whole thing."
"The deep dish here does not disappoint! Three of us went for an early dinner on a weekday to avoid the crowd. We arrived around 4/4:15pm and did not wait for a table, but tables seemed to run out by 4:45/5pm with a line forming at the door. The pizza is worth it though. We also ordered the appetizer sampler, which was good because we were starving and deep dish pizza can take some time to make. Overall a good meal!"
"So good. Love the carmelized crust. Can be a long wait on weekends and very long wait with delivery, but well worth it!"
"Pequod's certainly provides a unique style of pizza to Chicago, with a funky vibe. I hear nothing but great things but every time I've gone I get mediocre service and a pool of cheese that sits in a dough bowl. ‍"
"My personal favorite deep dish pizza in the city! The pizza is delicious, and I normally don't love deep dish pizza. I love the crispy pepperoni as well.The only negative thing I will say is that we ordered a Caesar salad as an appetizer and it was literally a bed of lettuce with about 4-5 croutons and that was it, and it wasn't even the right kind of lettuce for a Caesar. The dressing wasn't mixed in either, so it was not at ALL worth it to get the salad. However, take it for what it's worth--their specialty is deep dish pizza and not salads.If you've ever heard of Pequod's before then you probably know this, but expect to wait a LONG time for your table--but it's definitely worth the wait!"
"I got the personal pan sausage, it was excellent.  Had the famous crust, good beer. Recommend this place for sure."
"This is hands down the best pizza in Chicago! The deep dish is the best in town! Crispy crust, moist pizza. So good you'll wonder why you hadn't  come here sooner cause I know I do! Pizza does take a little more time to cook but you won't regret it!"
Pequod's is one of the best pizzas in the city and a most visit for all of my out of town guests.
"Deep dish pizza at it's best. Been here many times and never disappointed. At busy times, there can be a wait, but it's always worth it."
"My husband and I always stop here before or after a movie and it's delicious.The wait time is long but it's worth it.The staff has always been friendly, the food always good and we'll continue to go here.I'm more of a thin, cracker crust type of pizza lover but with that being said, this is the only place I'll eat a pan/deep dish pizza because the crust alone is pure perfection. It's a bit pricey but it's worth it."
The best deep dish in Chicago. The crust is the best part! I go hot peppers and pepperoni. It's worth the wait and a place you have to try.
"Greatest Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago. Everyone else is tryin' to be Pequod's. The crust is incredible due to the pans they have been using for decades. There is no other crust like it with the caramelization and flavor. If there is a wait it's worth it, but there are also nights with no wait at all. Great in any season and any time of day!"
There are numerous pizza styles and Pequod's has a cultish following for their crusts.  You should be one of them but all in all I like a little less bread.
The deep dish pizza was awesome! The location is a bit out of the downtown core but the pizza was well worth it! Huge portions and their butter crust was amazing
Classic yet unique. Pan pizza at the top of its game. You don't know Chicago Pizza if you haven't had Pequods.
"Solid pizza experience. Pretty good Chicago deep dish pizza but not quite as good as Giordanos in my opinion. The sausage topping is great though. Medium easily serves 3 people (and that's if they have big appetites). Mozzarella sticks were extra cheesy, stringy, and crunch on the outside. There's an attempt to do a sports bar theme but it's not totally cohesive. The music choice is cliche radio hits but that's all negligible in my overall rating of the place."
"This is probably the best deep dish pizza you can find in Chicago. It is absolutely delicious down to the last bite! The line/wait is usually incredibly long, which is the main turn off, but despite that the prices are great and the pizza is even better! If you are in Chicago for a weekend, a month, or a year, you have to come here at least once (if you can limit it to just one time). And if the line is long, just hold out because it is so worth it."
"It's a joke that the rating for Pequod's is only 4 stars right now. Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago. If you are in town for a few days and want to say you had Chicago's best pizza - this is the one. Go here, get the pan pizza, have a slice or three, and temporarily forget about how disappointing the bean was."
"Great pizza!!It's a tough call... But their pan pizza might be better than Giordano's stuffed pizza.Attached is pan pizza with black olives and ground beef.Their thin pizza was ok, not the best... Pizano's or Pat's pizza might be better."
Great place for a pizza pie. A divey kind of place with dim lighting and ambiance for discerning pizza lovers. It's good for pizza night or date night.
"Pequod's Pizzeria is the best place in all of Chicago to get incredible deep dish pizza. Even though we went when it was busy, we got our pizza in a very timely manner, and were overwhelmed by how good it was. We've tried different pizza all over Chicago, and all four of us who went agreed that Pequod's was the best, and that we'll be going back when we visit the city."
A delicious Chicago staple and must try place! Pequods never disappoints with its Chicago cheese pizza! The atmosphere really helps tie the whole experience together for a perfect night in Chicago!
"I'm a huge NY style/thin crust pizza person. I feel like you get so much more of the flavor that way. But, obviously, coming to Chicago, I had to give the authentic deep dish a try. Many recommended Pequod's as one of the best deep dish pizzas. We planned it out right by going in the late afternoon. We were able to get seated right away, but it still takes 45 minutes once you are seated to get the pizza. Imagine if you had to wait in line for 2 hours and then 45 minutes after getting seated? That's the norm for a place like this. We went with the regular cheese and added some green peppers. Didn't want to compromise the authentic cheesy taste too much by adding too much. The pizza was delicious and one medium was perfect for 3 people. Boy is it cheesy and bready. But, not too much bread as I was expecting. I liked how the crust was crisp, giving it more flavor and helping it stay together well. I think the crust was pretty memorable - they flavor it very well, and it's the perfect amount of crisp.. The cheesiness was exceptional, as you could see it as you pulled apart each piece, which you want with pizza, am i rite? Glad we were recommended this spot when visiting. Hope to be back soon!"
"Not a fan of deep dish or pan pizza but the pan pizza here is pretty good! The atmosphere here is laid back and chill, great place to grab a beer and a bite."
"We tried a few of the top-rated deep-dish pizza places on our first trip to Chicago. Pequod's was our absolute favorite by far. The crust was perfect and just the right amount of crispy. The toppings were on top of the sauce and cooked to perfection. It was the perfect taste of deep-dish that was expected. I am normally a thin-crust, NY style pizza lover and this deep dish was top notch for me. Would recommend this pizzeria to anyone visiting Chicago!"
"There are two floors! The first floor was super crowded when I walked in, but when we were seated on the second floor it wasn't as bad. We were seated quickly.  The waitress came quickly with waters and explained the menu to us. We ordered and the pizza came out in about 40 minutes! The toppings were great, but the crust on the other hand wasn't as impressive.  The crust seemed a bit overdone and was a tad too hard for me. Possibly was just a busy day and they rushed it or left it for too long. Would come back to try again!"
Absolutely love pequods!!! It's a defendant authentic Chicago favorite!!! Less commercialized and among the best stuffed/deep dish pizzas!!
"Simply AMAZING! We tried a couple of the most popular deep dish pizzas in Chicago, but Pequode's was simply the best. You're not there for the pricey sit down dinner experience, you're there for tons of flavor!"
I have had the thin crust pizza here several times and it is always my favorite. It is a pretty busy place so be prepared to wait!
"Omgosh, can you say scrumptious!! Seriously, this deep dish pizza is to die for. Great service, good ambiance, and deliciously tasting pizza. You absolutely must try it. I can't wait to be back!"
Super good! Not my favorite Chicago pizza but top 5 for sure! Always busy too which is a great sign.
Best deep dish I've ever had.  Been to a lot of different places but this is the best.  Simply amazing.
"Please don't eat here - simply put, I would like to keep this place all to myself, making it my very own deep dish Mecca. Pequod serves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the best deep dish pizza you'll ever eat. Their vegetarian pizza sets the standard for all veggie pizzas.Go early. Go often. Just don't ruin it for me..."
"Pequod's pizza is LIFE!! I feel barbarically super basic admitting that I once thought Giordannos had the best deep dish pizza (this in comparison to Due, Connie's, and Lou's). In terms of pan pizza, Pequods sets the bar high. All other pan pizza in comparison is ok at best. If you've gone and didn't order a pan pizza, well done, and dislike Pequods, GO BACK!! You need to order that!!... You're welcome! :)"
"IMHO Pequods is the Best deep dish in Chicago, hands down! Always a great spot to take a visitor."
best deep dish in Chicago hands down. Make sure to be seated downstairs. Upstairs is cheap and lack luster.
"Best pizza I have ever eaten. The crunchy crust, tangy sauce, and gooey cheese were amazing. I wish it was in California."
"I really like Pequod's! One of my favorite Pizzas in Chicago! There is always a long wait, but you can go accross the street and hang out at Barne's and Noble until your table is ready. I personally like that."
Great Pizza... But only as a carry out.  The wait is just too long for my tastes.
"I LOVE their pizza -- my husband and I agree that it is hands-down the best deep-dish pizza we've had in Chicago. They caramelize the crust and it is wonderful.The star down is for wait-time when it's busy. They're really great when it's an off time and they're not busy. Super friendly and helpful, but they need to do something about how they handle customers during the busy times. They don't take reservations, instead they have a priority seating list that puts you at the top of the wait list when you arrive. When I went with a large-ish group, they told me we'd have about a 45 minute wait. It took about 90 minutes, and we had something scheduled (and paid for and reserved) right afterwards, so it was super stressful trying to get dinner before we went to our event, and we weren't even really able to enjoy ourselves -- just ordered a couple of pizzas, had a beer, and had to take off. So, not the best place to go for dinner if you have somewhere else to be later, but still good food.Like I said, when they're not busy, the experience is great. They always have a game on and have great food. The service staff makes great recommendations for beer when asked and the atmosphere fits in well with a sports bar -- a little dark on the inside, but all the better to watch a game, eat pizza, and have a drink. If you come with a large group, be prepared to be a little squished. They don't have a ton of room and are quite busy during the dinner hour."
"With its delicious caramelized crust, perfect sauce and cheese to topping ratio, Pequod's is hands down the best deep dish in the city. Pass the ranch."
You need to plan ahead if you want delivery. To my location it's 2 hours but well worth the wait. A thick airy crust topped with plenty of cheese and tasty sauce. I recommend the sausage and pepperoni.  I have had pizza from.many places and states but have never had pizza like this.
"Chicago is well known for their deep dish pizza but you would for sure be missing out if you didn't try Pequod's pan pizza. I could eat it all day, every day. The dough is thick and the perfect mixture of soft and firm. The sauce is not too chunky with vegetables (onions and tomatoes) and this comes from someone who hates chunky sauce. The crispy edges of the pan pizza is so good! The garlic bread was also scrumptious, as were the mozzarella sticks. One of my favorite Lincoln Park treasures :)"
"I have eaten at Pequod's and have had it delivered.  Both are extremely delicious and the delivery enables one to not have to wait forever.  Their spinach/garlic pan is so delicious with the caramelized crust.  The last time it was delivered, the pizza seemed a bit doughy and I would have liked it to have more cheese/tomato sauce.  Perhaps it was a random occurrence since I don't remember Pequod's being super doughy like this before.  I have also tried their thin crust with basil and it is delicious.  I recommend Pequod's for both deep dish and thin crust.  All of their ingredients are well-done and they do not skimp on them."
"In a city of pretenders trying to hang with the big dogs, Pequad's stands out. Great pizza and crust!"
"Being a Chicagoan, I've had my fair share of pizza and there is a reason why this pizza joint always has an hour long wait outside and two hour window of delivery...BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING.Their stuffed pepperoni pizza is the best tasting pizza ever. I don't know how they do it time after time but it's delicious and I'm addicted to it. The wait is WORTH IT. Also their pequods salad is a great addition to their pizza. They produce quality pizza and it's a pizza place you must try in Chicago."
"great, fresh and hot pizza in morton grove.  YUMM"
"Im not from Chicago, but I travel there often and always make sure to try a new pizza place every time Im in town... Ill go ahead and say it, Pequod's is the best pizza I have ever had. Pequod's is #1 for me and Lou Malnati's is #2"
"Solid pizza, great crust, usually busy but understandable given the food. Favorite pizza in Chicago."
"Everyone has a different  idea  of  what is THE BEST. Best pizza,  best  burger,  etc.  I really like the pizza here because it's a little  different.  I like  ordering the personal  pan pizza's.  I like the way they are cooked  in those  old  skillets.  And  the toppings  are fresh and plentiful.   For me,  this place has the BEST  pizza."
"I've tried giordano's and pequod's now and I can see why people like both. However, I think I might choose pequod's over giordano's because of the way the crust is made. I liked that the crust was crunchy and the pizza was soft. I created my own toppings when I went and got mushroom, onions, and sausage. Choosing the toppings I think can also make or break the pizza flavors. It seems like this place is always busy so know that there will be a wait. I didn't know this because it was my first time there. But you can call ahead to have your name written down, and once you get there, they will move your name up to the top. So you do still have to wait, but it won't be like an hour. Once you place your order of pizza, know that it will take about an hour to make the pizza. So it's probably a good idea to order appetizer if your starving. I ordered the jalapeño poppers which were fantastic! Recommended to us by our server. It was just me and my bf that was there so we ordered an appetizer and a size small for pizza. Size small has 4 slices but keep in mind that it's a chunky slice. I was able to only eat 1 slice because It's so much going on in just 1 slice."
"I really wish i saved my picture from the times I've ate here, but clearly I was always toooooooooo hungry that I forget to take a picture. The food here is phenomenal, the pizza here is MY FAV PIZZA in Chicago. This spot is underrated, the food, the environment, everything is great! Love this place!"
"Best pizza in chicago. The place is a little small and might seem cramped for moments, but you can wait next door at their new bar while your pie ia cooking. Expect to wait in line for a while."
"The best thing about the pizza is the dough (a little overrated, Malnati's is still better in my book). Great hang out place, good location and good food/service."
"My first Chicago deep dish, and I will never forget it.  It took us a while to walk to Pequods from the train station, so cue happy sounds of satisfaction when sitting down at one of the high round tables near the center of the room.  I was a little surprised by the bar like atmosphere, but it was fun to watch sports as well as a pizza tour group that arrived later.  After debating about the toppings and the size with some advice thrown in by our friendly waitress, we ordered together.  The pizza arrived an hour later.If you know anything about the Chicago pizza scene, you'll know that there are many different camps that pizzas fall in.  Pequods specializes in a burnt crust variety, with a thick crust and much cheesey goodness.  Very delicious!  I also overestimated the size of my stomach and could only finish two slices, so I end up taking quite a bit home for later."
"best pizza in Chicago. Order takeaway and take it to the bar across the street, Kibbitznest."
"An incredible authentic Chicago style pizza place.  The slices were incredible and the atmosphere was textbook pizza joint.  The wait staff could use a little hospitality, but the food more than made up for it."
"Best deep dish, pan, Chicago style pizza! Wait is long usually, but they're always friendly."
"OMG this place is the REAL OG! I've never had pizza as delicious as this, EVER. Run don't walk to Pequod's. I would literally fly back from Atlanta just to enjoy a pie from here.  Their deep dish pans are old and well seasoned, making the crust taste like absolute heaven."
All time favorite pizza in the city and maybe even ever... it's amazing! The crust is doughy in the middle and crunchy on the bottom and the caramelized cheese on the edge is the best part. Also has a great cheese and sauce ratio. If you go before 5 you usually don't have to wait but go any later and it can be up to 2 hours BUT you can wait at the bar and get som pre pizza drinks.
"Good place, really. Comfy room and great service. I can't find a single thing to complain about, but I have a hard time coming up with a big compliment either. The pizza was good, but not exciting. The charred edges of the crust were nice but the dough to toppings ratio here is a little bread heavy for my taste. I enjoyed it and have no complaints, but it's hard to come up with anything that impressed me overall. The people were nice, but not overwhelming. Bottom line, don't be afraid to visit this place. You'll enjoy it. It's a good spot with good people. You probably won't find yourself raving to your friends about it later though."
"I've ordered at the restaurant and also have had delivery, both very similar in the quality of food! In my opinion, is superior than Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno, Gina's or Giordano's. Consider delivery if you're in a time rush. From order being placed to pizza arriving to our apartment in Lakeview East - it only took about 1 hour 20 minutes, I was blown away!"
"Wow! Don't go to the popular place everyone goes. Go get pizza at local places like this. I loved it! The Pizza sauce is wonderful.My husband pointed out to me how the pizza is made in Chicago.  Crust, Cheese, and then the sauce is on top of the cheese along with all the toppings.  WHAT A GREAT IDEA!!!  I wish everyone made pizza this way.The crust at this place was crispy and tasty, takes about 40 minutes to make the pizza so don't show up starving, but don't go eat before you come here because there is a lot of pizza to eat and enjoy.I didn't realize there was an upstairs till we were seated up there.  This place is much larger then I expected and perfectly placed in a wonderful community where you can walk around and enjoy the outside shopping areas around as you wait to be seated and enjoy wonderful food."
Great pizza if you enjoy Chicago deep dish. This is more of a pan pizza but the caramelized crust is what sets it apart from the rest.
This may actually be one of the best deep dish places in town. Their caramelized cheese crust really stands out and it stays true to Chicago style deep dish. Great lunch special deals as well.
"While in Chicago, we were on the hunt for the best deep dish. We only had a chance to try two, so I can't compare Pequod's to all the other deep dishes of Chicago. With so many different places at our disposal, we went with Pequod's because of the solid reviews. Although it wasn't our favorite of the trip, we still thought it was good! The small (10"") was more than enough food for two. It's cool that you can do half toppings here, we loaded it up with veggie toppings for me and meat for the meat eater. I couldn't really taste the cheesy crust, and to be honest prefer Lou Malnati's crust a bit more. We came at an obscure time and there was no wait. It's a bit of a trek, but it's worth checking out if you're like us and want to check out the best of Chicago."
"There is always an argument about the best Chicago Pizza. Well, this is it. If you are a true Chicagoan you understand that Pequad's is where it's at!"
"Delightfilully Chicago. Crispy crust amazing cheese. Order extra sauce and don't bother dinning in. A+, best deep dish in the Chi."
"Was recommended to this spot by a Chicago native so I had to try it out. I was told to ""not have high expectations"" for Chicago deep dish pizza but I was still looking forward to trying it out. We sat upstairs in a booth. Service was honestly... OK. It took a minute for our server to greet us and we weren't really checked on much, until we requested for the check. I really enjoyed the pizza though! Crispy crust and it was soft and hearty with toppings on the top -- I really liked it. Definitely the type of pizza to put you in a coma. I wanted to ask for extra sauce on the side because the pizza is quite bread-y but as I mentioned above, we did not receive much service."
"Hands down, Pequod's is the best Chicago deep dish. Pequod's is always a staple of my Chicago trips. I always try to eat there at least once while I am in town. The first couple times I was in Chicago, I did the touristy thing and went to Giordano's, etc. I did not know about the Holy Grail of Chicago pizza yet. A friend of mine told me I was missing out and needed to stay away from the tourist trap pizza places and experience true Chicago pizza. I had high expectations for my first time when I went to Pequod's, and they definitely were met and exceeded! I was not disappointed. If you go on a weekend, you should expect a wait, unless you utilize the call ahead seating that they offer. The pizza does take some time to make, but it is expected. Their pizza is actually true deep dish pizza, with the perfect combination of dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. (Instead of having loads of cheese and toppings filled with a thin layer of dough.) I can't even put in words how amazing the flavor is, especially with the caramelized cheese on the crust! That's probably one of my favorite parts!!! The atmosphere is great inside as well, especially to watch your favorite team. Lots of televisions and you will have a view of multiple screens from wherever you are seated. I was impressed with how reasonable the price was at Pequod's as well. If you haven't had Pequod's deep dish yet, you need to go try it ASAP. It will change your life and you will not want to eat any other Chicago deep dish ever again."
"The best pizza in Chicago. The best location is in Morton Grove. If someone tells you Lou Malnatis is the best, than they are a fake and don't understand real pizza. The caramelized crust can't be beat, and you can't go wrong with any of the toppings. Make sure you call in advance because the pizza takes over an hour to cook, and don't worry about ordering too much the leftovers taste even better. Enjoy."
"This is by far the best pan pizza in Chicago. I come here every time I have visitors. Every single person loves it. It's a good idea to come during the week for lunch for a shorter wait. Still worth the wait for dinner, however."
"Pequod's defines what deep dish pizza should be. This is a must-do when our friends come in from out of town...and after we take them once, they request it every time they come back. The crust...THE CRUST!!! It's kind of burnt but not...look, I don't know what they do or how they do it but the crust is to die for! From the quality of the ingredients, to the cozy atmosphere and the great service...you really can't go wrong!"
This is my favorite pizza joint hands down. You can't beat the price and it's right by the movie theater! The service from the servers is unbeatable. I always feel like family when I come. Thank you pequods!
If you're a fan of deep dish pizza this is a must! Line goes outside though on weekends. Mad busy! Definitely need a bigger location. Service is fair space itself is like any other old restaurant. Cheers
"If you want local deep dish, this is your spot. Voted the best among everyone I know and the perfect place to bring out of town guests. We have friends who look forward to coming here every time they visit. Grab a drink because you will most likely have a wait. No gluten free options here but if you are with a big group, you can get one of their salads which are pretty solid."
I loved the pizza and wings we had at Pequod's. I was visiting in town with some friends and we felt very welcome and enjoyed the food and beer together. We had a great experience! I will say that their furniture is a little older so the atmosphere gets a 3/5 from me but overall the service and quality of the food was great! Happy with our experience!
"When in Chicago, you gotta go get yourself a deep dish pizza.You can go for one of the chain restaurants, or you can try a local joint.The bf and i came here in the afternoon. No wait around 5/6 o'clock.What sets this place apart from the other pizza joints? The caramelize crust. God that crust was good.I would have to say, if you like a thick, hardy, toasty crust, tart tomato base, and lots of gooey cheese, then this is the place to go.THe bf and I ordered the small and it was SO MUCH FOOD. We ended up getting just mushroom, which was a good choice since it didn't end up too oily or overwhelming.i complete recommend this place and if you can, come for their lunch special. It's like $5 for a personal pizza!Score!"
"After trying many pizza joints during my Chicago visit, I really enjoyed Pequod's pan crust deep dish style with the rising dough. Also, their crust had a nice crisp, burnt looking cheese crust along the edges. This was definitely my favorite deep dish style and one of my favorite deep dish pizzas I have had!"
"This place is quintessential Chicago.   Wow.  I loved it so much.  The pizza was great ""college"" style... but for those of us with a bit of a honed taste.. probably a bit to much sauce.   Anyway.. .just my opinion, but.. overall.. excellent.  And great for a 1st date!"
"It is a nice cozy neighborhood Pizzeria.  I have lived in Chicago most of my life and can say that I have frequented many, many other establishments.   We ordered a thin pepperoni large pizza which was tasty.  It arrived in a timely manner.  The service was ok.  The staff is mainly female (at least from what I could see that day).  We sat at the bar because my out of town friend was starving and did not want to wait a minute longer.  I was surprised that on this particular night (weeknight) it was not busy at all.  The female staff seemed to be more interested in talking to my male friend which I found to be very disrespectful and unprofessional.  Luckily, this is a friend otherwise he would have been replaced very quickly if he was a significant other.  Like I said, the attention was toward him that I did not even or was asked if I wanted any water.  The bar area where we sat was dirty and sticky and no one bothered to even wipe it down.  It gave me a sick feeling so I barely touched or leaned up against it.  I took a few bites of the pizza which I said was tasty.  I guess my friend could tell that I was unhappy by the look on my face that decided to eat as fast as he could and leave the place.  If I were to order pizza from this place again I would definitely order it to go.  Parking was not difficult to find, but with so many other pizza joints in this great city, it will be a while before I head over to this place and order their famous pizza."
"Probably the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Visited Chicago and had to visit this place. Waited about 1.5 hours for a party of 2 on a Saturday night. I wish that they'd allow ordering before seating so that it's ready the the time the table is. Sadly, it takes 45 minutes from time of ordering to receiving the pizza. But it is so worth it! The caramelized crust makes it a masterpiece. Definitely visiting again when I'm in town"
Amazing pizza. The bar/front staff could be friendlier but honestly the pizza was so good I barely cared.
"Pequod's is one of my favorite Chicago deep dish pizzas.  The crust is caramelized and crispy, and the pizza simply hits the spot.  I usually go plain cheese, because I'm a simple guy.  Wait times can be long, but I guess that's a good thing?"
"We stopped in after a Cubs game on a Saturday around 515 place wasn't that crowded we got a seat right away . The inside is small and hot . The pizza was good , not amazing like I have read . They have a ton of workers with Pequods shirts on walking around , and multiple girls came back to check on us and refill our drinks . So we weren't really sure who our server was . Very small menu , but we went for the deep dish pizza . It was a nice Saturday dinner in the city, if we are in the area again we will stop by .They do have a call ahead seating option , your not guaranteed to be seated right away but if they are busy I would do this option on the way there . I also heard if you order a pickup and decide to stay and eat they seat you fairly quickly. There is street parking (which is hard to get ) but also a Parking garage across the street ."
Love coming here for pizza. But the wait for a table is extremely long and ridiculous. Maybe getting a bigger spot? Besides that pizzas good and staff is very nice as well!
"I know they're known for their ""awesome"" deep dish; however, I don't really like it. I prefer the thin crust. It has a great taste. This place is always busy."
"One of the best pizzas in Chicago. Deep dish is fantastic. Hands down better then Gino's East and Giordanos .   Great flavor, only thing I don't like is how long the wait is to always get a pizza. I guess that means it's fresh though !"
"Forget Giordano's, forget Home Run Inn, forget Lou Malnati's, forget Gino's East. Pequod's puts them all to shame. Hands-down, best pizza I've ever had. There's usually a massive wait (especially during Cubs games), and pizzas take an hour to cook, but it is absolutely worth it. The sauce is rich and spicy, and the crust has the perfect amount of crunch to it. Don't get it delivered, though. It completely alters the texture of the crust to a mushy substance. If you do have to get it delivered, order it uncut, and throw it in a hot oven for a few minutes to firm the crust back up. The one thing they could do better is their delivery system. They're very unaccommodating with their delivery zone, and it can take over two hours to get your food. (I've been told by a driver that they keep a short staff of drivers.)"
"We got here on a Saturday night around 6-7 PM. There was about an hour or so wait. Meanwhile, we luckily got a spot at the bar and enjoyed some beers and the Blackhawks game. Finally, it was time to eat. We got the deep dish pizza with caramelized crust. Pizza was pretty delicious, but the crust is what made it unique. I've pretty much had the best of the best when it comes to deep dish, but this place is right up there. It's hard to be blown away when you've had the best, but there was definitely no denying that the pizza and experience is worth the trip."
"Enjoyed the pizza. Seemed a little over cooked not just ""caramalized"" but for the price and service I would definitely recommend this place to someone wanting deep dish and not looking to break the bank"
"The first time I was here, there was no wait (we came super late on a weekday). This was a few years ago while on vacation, but it was SO good that I remembered it. Fast forward to the present, I had to go back and again, it was soooo goood. Waited about 30min this time but still worth it. Definitely a must eat in Chicago. I've also had Giordano's and it was mediocre. If you're going to try deep dish then you gotta try Pequod's!"
Chicago in a pizza! Great drafts too. Seating is downstairs and upstairs. Quick with the drinks. Takes a few for the pizza. Worth the wait. Thanks guys!
"After seeing this quaint little spot on three different shows, we had to make the trek while in Chicago! The crunchy cheese crust around the pizza is superb and also  the best part. If your into the deep dish or have never had it, it's definitely different and unique; this east coast gal likes NY style or Detroit style( if ever in Pittsburgh I'll show you the best Detroit style). Appreciate the uniqueness and the fact that it's different from regular Chicago deep dish."
"I will not eat pepperoni pizza unless it's from here! The service, vibes and food is great. Even delivery is great. When friends and I go out for pizza this is always the place for our group."
"Best deep dish pizza I've tried in Chicago! It's a little outside of downtown, but it's worth the drive or cab ride. I prefer Pequods anyday over Gino's and Giordanos. Tip- They do call aheads which saves a lot of time since this place gets packed."
"Deep dish pizza, yum! I came here with a friend on a weekend for lunch around 11:30AM, and there was no wait. There was a wait, however, for the pizza to come out; I hear it's pretty typical though. We ordered a small pizza with spinach, mushroom, bell pepper, and pepperoni. The sauce wasn't very flavorful and towards the middle, the crust got soggy. For the most part though when the pizza first came out, the bottom of the crust was crunchy which was nice! I really enjoyed it. The outer crust was my favorite part though; it was a bit burnt and it was super crunchy and delicious! Good place to eat, I would definitely recommend it. The bill came out to be around $11 post-tax, which I don't know whether is typical or not for deep dish. Delicious though!"
"You're not a true Chicagoan if you haven't had Pequods's. Their deep dish is amazing. If you are going to eat in, get there at an off time as they are usually very busy during dinner and lunch hours. We frequent delivery and it is still hot when it arrives. YUM!"
"In a town know for deep dish and never changing the deep dish prerequisites, Pequod's stands out for making a great pie while diverging from the run of the mill pie's you'll find elsewhere. Easily taking the crown as my favorite Chicago deep dish, Pequod's excels exactly where the others, in my own humble opinion, have failed: refreshing a Chicago staple. The pies are deep but not so much that one slice fills you up. The crust is perfectly golden brown but allows the toppings to take top billing. If Pequod's wanted to improve, the only recommendation I could proffer is to open another location or expand their delivery radius to River North!!"
"Loved it! I think it's a tie between Pequod's and Giordano's for me. It's everything you'd expect if you're craving the usual deep dish pizza. Giordano's is more of a ""fancy"" deep dish in my opinion. While Pequod's focuses more on the crust, Giordano's is more about the toppings and cheese (which can be overwhelming and super rich). Both are great. I liked the atmosphere on the 2nd floor. Seemed like a dive bar. I'm surprised they don't have more locations in the downtown area!"
"Just how do they do it?  How does this place achieve deep dish pizza perfection?After some research, I found out some of the secrets.  First is the cast iron pizza pans, well-seasoned after many years of use.  Next is the dough, spread in a thick layer on the bottom of the oiled pizza pain, but not up the sides.  The cheese is whole mild mozzarella, sliced in house to exact specifications, and laid in overlapping pattern on top of the crust but, and here's one of the secrets, also placed up on the sides of the pan.  A hefty ladle of uncooked seasoned tomato sauce goes on top, followed by toppings, dried oregano and pecorino romano cheese.  The thing bakes for about 20 minutes in a 600 degree oven.  The result?  The crust has a beautiful lacy caramelized ring around it, the sauce is sweet and tangy with great depth of flavor, and the toppings are charred to great effect.It's deep dish pizza perfection!  Hard. To. Stop. Eating. It.The only downside is that it's busy and the wait is long.  On a rainy Saturday at 1:30 pm, we waited about 45 minutes to get in, and then it took another 45 minutes to get our pizza after we sat down.  Don't fret, your patience will be rewarded!"
Absolutely amazing pizza!  Crust was incredibly crispy and that caramelized cheese...drool...We actually didn't have to wait long for a table on a Friday night (Tip: use their priority wait seating on their website!  It's not really a reservation but they'll put you on the front of their wait list once you arrive).
"My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago! The burnt crust is absolutely delicious. It's a place that I would love to be able to make a reservation, but it is worth the wait. Whenever I go to another pizza place, I find myself wishing that the crust tasted more like Pequod's. Deep dish is not something you can have every day, but whenever I do have it this is the only one I think is worth the unimaginable level of fullness I experience when done eating!"
"My first real chicago deep dish pizza! We walked in a few minutes after they open, and there were already a few customers inside... a good sign.Took about an hour which is reasonable, so we ordered a half order of fries to keep us entertained (yum and cheap). A ""small"" pizza has only 4 slices but is definitely enough to feed two people. That delicious smell of freshly made pizza, the cheese string lasting forever, the toppings are big and juicy. and stuffed at capacity. The crust is solid... crispy crunchy almost cookie like. The sides are baked with caramelized cheese and is almost 4 inches high. Very satisfying.Staff was friendly and was great at helping us customize our perfect pizza!"
Great! Just don't come in when you're already starving- deep dish takes 45min-1hour.
By far the best deep dish in Chicago. I've been here multiple times and never was let down by the food or service.
"My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago.  Pequod's is a whale of a good time.  This pizza is legit they don't Moby Dick around with the quality.  Great place for a date night, slam a couple pizzas and let the romance commence!"
"First time I had their burnt crust years ago, I wasn't so much of a fan.  Lately I have had it a couple times and find it very unique and addicting.  Friendly service, good unique chicago style pizza.  Definitely recommend trying it out."
"Now that I've tried most of this city's popular pizza joints, I feel like I can put each one into their own category. By far Giordano's is still my favorite because they have a fierce gooey cheese game going on in their pies. Lou's tends to be more saucy, while here we found it to be overly bready.On our first visit we tried the thin crust which we enjoyed, so we were very excited to get their famous deep dish with an all cheese crust, which is phenomenal by the way. Who knew burnt cheese could taste so good? The pizza seemed to be a good inch of bread high with a layer of sauce and toppings as opposed to more of a deep dish where the bottom layer of dough is thinner and the toppings deeper and more plentiful. It still tastes great sure, but everyone has a preference. My husband likes Lou's the best which is why we were hoping to have this be our new favorite and could that way compromise and eat here when we were in town. I like that it has the feel of a local sports bar and the service was stellar. Our waitress comped one of my husband's beers for taking a long time to come out when we hadn't even noticed or brought it up which I thought was completely awesome and unnecessary. Still do come here and try it to decide for yourself which pizza suits your fancy. The toppings are fresh, the flavors on point, and you certainly won't leave hungry! They also have great lunch specials and you can call ahead and put your name down during high wait times."
"Closer location than the original to downtown of my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza.Food: 5, Atmosphere: 3, Service: 4Cost to worth it rating: 4 ($22 for 1 topping large pan pizza)Return worthiness: yesHighlights:- Caramelized crust: their differentiator - Toppings: they have meatball (liked this a lot), Italian beef, and giardiniera and top it with lots of gooey melty cheese- Garlic bread: solid to munch on while you wait - Serve the full menu until 2am- Full bar- $5 lunch special: includes personal pizza and a sodaMidlights:- No specialty pizzas: you gotta make up your ownLowlights:- Bit of a car ride to get to from downtown Still love this pie and will be back."
Love this place. Super easy to pick up pizza on my way home today as it always is. Pizza is a unique style and the burnt crust is addictive.
One of the best Chicago deep dish pizza! Love their crust! They also have an awesome lunch special for $5.95
"This was pretty good. I can see why people like the carmelized crust, but I'm a big fan of the flaky crust pizza. I was glad that the wait was not too long and that we were seated within 20 minutes."
"Our server Angela was fantastic!! She was able to accommodate our group and was able to split all of our receipt!! Thank you Angela!!We all had their deep dish Chicago Style Pizza! It was a mix comment, but overall not bad. you would have to know what Chicago deep dish pizza is about, otherwise, you might find it interestingly different!!I would've taken photos, but our whole group worked the whole day for more than 16 hours and by 10:30pm, we were all exhausted and just ready to just dive in and eat!! LOLOverall, I'd recommend coming here and be one of the locals!!Until then, Cheers!! ~ :p"
"My first Chicago style deep dish pizza did not disappoint! The place is pretty divey and unapologetically so. Since the pizza itself was going to take about 30-40 minutes, we ordered their cheese bread to start. The cheese bread is almost artery clogging with the amount of cheese that they put on it and was the perfect size to share between three people without being too much. We ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and basil pizza. The crust came out looking like it was burnt but it was just how they caramelized cheese. The crust itself was very crispy on the outside while fluffy and doughy on the inside. The addition of the caramalized/burnt cheese was definitely my favorite part of the pizza and was quite addicting! The pepperoni was pretty standard and I liked their sausage a lot better because it was more flavorful. The only real downside is that the pizza was mainly a really thick crust. Though it was tasty, I could only really get through one whole slice before being sent into a carb-induced food coma. Once we got over the intial wow-factor of the crispy cheese, we mainly picked away at the toppings of our next slices.Overall, I think Pequod's was a great introduction to Chicago deep dish for me and I can't wait to try other spots to be able to compare!"
"Chicago is the land of deep-dish pizza. And I can't stand it. The only time I would ever get deep-dish was when I had a friend in from out of town. Ever since I discovered the deliciousness that is Pequod's, it's not just the only pizza place I take friends too, it's where I like to go whenever I'm in the mood for a really good pizza pie. It's not deep dish. It's deep-pan pizza so, while the pizza is two inches thick, most of that is crust instead of normal deep dish sludge. And the caramelized crust is amazeballs. I was surprised how divey it felt when I first walked in but I like that they let their food speak for itself. The cheesy garlic bread is a solid starter, and they typically have pretty good drink specials. I've actually never had to wait too long to get seated, but I've also usually been able to avoid prime dinner time. The one time I had to wait at all, I was able to grab a drink at the bar next door while I waited for my buzzer, so no harm no foul."
"Pequods was my first deep dish experience in Chicago, and the only way I can describe it is good enough. We got a small 10-inch pizza with sausage and pepperoni, which paired with a side of fries was the perfect amount for two hungry dudes. The pizza takes about 40 minutes to come out, so I recommend ordering right away. The cheese is crispy, the toppings are on point, and the crust requires a fork and knife for sure.I do really like the atmosphere, which is like a cool locals bar. Not as touristy as the Lou Malnati's in downtown Chicago. That gives it a slight edge in the comparison, but the pizza comes down to whether you like a crispier or slightly softer pie."
"Great place. Went here for a birthday party. My food took a little while to get to my table, and our waitress kept assuring us multiple times that the wings would be ready soon, but it took about 30 minutes from the first time she said that. So service might be slow here sometimes, but mind you it was kind of busy at that time."
"Originally from Chicago I've had many of the Deep Dish Pizza's from several of the popular and less popular places in Chicagoland.  Lou Malnati's has always been my favorite go to pie for years.  Until now, there was no competition IMHO.  Recommended by a city Lyft driver, great reviews on Yelp and other references, we decided to try Pequod's. We (all five of us who are all long time Deep Dish fans) were NOT disappointed. Great pie! The crust, the ingredients including the sausage and cheese are top quality. The sauce is excellent with a slight tangy while the acidity is low and cooked out. Going forward when visiting ""My Kind of Town"", I'll now have pan pizza on two different nights. One night at Lou's and one night at Pequad's  (not necessarily in that order).  Expect to wait during peak hours but it's worth the effort! Very reasonably priced as well!"
omfg! lost for words..... just go try it! nuff said!!!!
"I am not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but Peqoud's is pretty damn good. The crust is excellent, caramelized deliciousness; and the toppings are always fresh and plentiful. The service is excellent, and the background music always has me singing along, to my friends chagrin. I don't get here often enough. I love Lou Malnati's, but Peqoud's is a very close second. I adore this place."
"I've tried out two other pizza spots in Chicago while traveling here for a few days and this is the best! I would come back here again for their cheese pan pizza which is what I got. They have a lunch special during the weekdays from 11:00am to 3pm for $4.95 so I would recommend ordering that. You can get a personal pan pizza with a fountain drink for the price, which is very reasonable. The quantity is sufficient too for one person but you can even share it. My friends and I ordered an extra one to go as well."
"Hahahah, Pequods.You like deep dish? You like this place.I think the overly-detailed bad reviews are hilarious. This is not burger king. You do not get it your way. You get it Pequods way, and sometimes, you have to just take it that way.But I am not here to talk about how long it took to get my food, nor if the server was rude to me, or if your box had a dent in it. I am here to talk about how the food put in front of me was, which is really what we should all be talking about."
"My favorite deep dish pizza ever. You just can't beat Peaquod's: quality ingredients, good sauce/cheese/toppings ratio, and the perfect level of char. I know the charred aspect isn't a favorite for everyone, but I think it completes the pizza and makes it into the perfect Pequod's crust. I've been here several times and the service is kind of hit or miss, but fortunately for them, their pizza is so good that I keep coming back regardless. If you're coming in from out of town and you want deep dish, THIS IS IT. Also try your fav topping with giardinera (spicy food lovers only)... thank me later. :)"
"Having lived in Chicago for over a decade, leaving and then coming back again, I can now safely say that the beat deep dish is from Pequods. It's tough to get in on a weekend night, but weekday evenings are no problem."
The best deep dish pizza in Chicago! We actually had it recommended to us by someone who lived there and we were very impress.  This isn't a big place so the wait can be a little long but worth the wait!
Decided to check it out once I read a couple reviews . Great pizza . Couldn't even finish the personal pan pizza
"I really like the pizza here. I've only had the deep dish. Also have had salad and apps there which were fine but nothing special. My boyfriend has gotten a pasta dish and thought it was good but nothing to write home about. The pizza has a caramelized crust which I've heard some people think is too much of a burnt flavor, which I can understand. It's up to your personal preference whether you will love the pizza or not. The service is just ok, and I've ordered it for delivery which was not a good experience. They messed up on my delivery time and tried to deliver it when I wasn't there, so came back about an hour later after completing more deliveries. I had to microwave the pizza once it arrived and the fries we got were soggy. I would go back for the pizza, but would not do delivery again."
Our favorite pizza place in chicago. Skip the long lines of tourists at all the other downtown spots and bring your family and friends here. It's a much more local feel with great food.
"Brenda was awesome. She really helped us out in a bind. Because we were traveling internationally and had card issues with fraud alerts, she was kind enough to make our order happen while we sorted out our credit card situation. Had she not done this in order to facilitate our order, we would have probably never tried (or gone back to) her establishment.For the record- we were a late night order, so time was of the essence.Much appreciate her faith in us, and let it be known that- given how great her service was, and delicious the pizza is- we shall now be regular customers, having recently moved here and this being our first pizza order in Chicago. Thank you, Brenda!"
"This really needs no help with a rating. I will tho, since I see some disgruntled NY and other folks who live out of town have given lower ratings. The crust is always just the right amount of crisp and done. It's a deep dish pizza done correctly, where others fail. The toppings are always tasty. I've never had it soggy, its always been slightly burnt, like their signature, and perfectly done thru the rest.So Fort Worth, Miami, Anh (real trendy spelling) and dorky Jake from SF, just stay in your respective smellier cities."
Best deep dish in town baby!!!!
"Great food, great service, reasonable prices, best pizza in chicago! 5 starts, id definitely recommend trying this place , if you dont live in town, trust make the trip west over here its awesome, great bar to watch sports games too!"
"It was a new experience for me to tell people all across the city that I'd had pizza, and when they asked ""where at"" I said ""Pequod's"" and the response was *universal* approval. ""You won't find better in the city. Good job."" It was almost as if people were surprised that I, some guy from Vegas, would be able to divine the local secrets of Chicago pizza. This place was awesome. That's the important part. Second most important: you're going to wait for it. We put our names in and went down the street to a bar they had partnered with to wait, instead of just sitting around waiting for a table in the actual restaurant. They gave us a buzzer and we started drinking. About 80 minutes later, the buzzer went off and we headed back to our table. We ordered garlic cheese bread for starters, and it was pretty good. I'd give it 4 stars if I had to grade the bread alone. It was still good, no doubt, the bread could have been a bit better if I had to pick one thing to improve. After we ordered our pizzas, one thick and one thin crust, we waited again and ate our garlic cheese bread and drank our drinks.The pizzas arrived. I'm not a big fan of Chicago-style deep dish. I consider myself a thin-crust man. The thin crust is thicker than I expected, more of a ""pan"" style, ""normal"" thickness. The deep dish was exactly what I expected. Even though I'm not a deep dish person, I ate two pieces and had to stop myself from having a third lest I leave no room for the thin crust. The thin crust was excellent, and the thickness was deceiving: it was crisp and delicious even though a bit airy. I am a big fan of both these pizzas. The toppings tasted great, the sauce was great, the service was pretty good. I'd come here again in a heartbeat. And I understand why everybody was so happy for me when I told them I'd come here."
"Always have their amazing pizza when I can. Love the lunch deals and I love the burnt cheese crust. The wait is typically pretty long but it is definitely worth it for this pizza. I am the kind of person who does come here during the less crowded times. Make sure you go during lunch for the 4.95 lunch special. Also there is a bar next door where you can have a drink while you wait. The buzzer will work in there while you wait. I do like sitting on the second floor better as it does feel cozier, especially for how long you have to wait, and they service I get up there is typically better. The past few times I have been here the servers have not been too warm and welcoming and it looked like they were just fed up by the huge crowds and lines. Us customers just can't help it when the cooks make this pizza so addictive so we keep coming. This is definitely a local mostly location and the best place in my opinion for deep dish in Chicago. This is coming from someone who doesn't pizzadiscriminate."
"Best to come in on a weekday if you're looking to dine in (carry outs good, but doesn't compare to pizza right out the oven) cause it's always super busy but this pizza really does live up to the hype."
"I went to Chicago for vacation and knew I couldn't leave without trying Chicago's deep dish pizza. We ended up picking Pequod's.We came on a Friday evening and had an approximately two hour wait. Luckily, there's a Barnes and Noble nearby to pass the time. After getting seated, we ordered a medium pizza, which was the perfect size for three, with fresh basil, sausages, and mushrooms. The basil seemed to be lacking in both quantity and flavor, but the other two toppings complemented the pizza really well! The crust of Pequod's pizza is also to die for and was yummy."
"For years, I've ben so confused as to why Pequod's isn't the place you hear about most for pizza. I tell anyone visiting that they need to go here. It's such a great spot and doesn't feel chainlike at all."
"I came here on a Saturday, and it was packed! When we got there, there was a wait, but we were able to grab a drink at their associated bar two doors down. We had one drink there before our table was ready. We had the cheesy garlic bread and created our own pizza. The cheesy garlic bread was great, and while I am not the biggest fan of deep dish pizza, it was still some of the best that I have had! It would have been nice if they had taken our order when we first got there and were waiting, as once we got seated upstairs it was about another hour until we got our pizza. Overall, good experience and I would definitely come again!"
"We shared a wonderful deep dish pizza that we customized with pepperoni, sausage and green papers. It was delicious! Be aware that you will wait 40 minutes from the point of ordering before your pizza is served! The place is multi-level and buzzing with people. Fun, casual environment!"
Pequod's is a rock solid pizza and I've been going there for 25 years. It's a bit of a wait most of the time so come early grab a beer and most importantly order in advance so you can sit down and eat your pizza right away instead of having to wait for your pizza order once you finally sit down. The pizza crust is crispy although I admit it could use a little salt. Thin crust is what my son likes. When you can hook a 13 year old on good pizza it creates an experience he'll have his entire life. Speaking of experience the place has a lot of character. Good place to take a date or a family!
"Great pizza, friendly service and laid back vibes in the cutest neighborhood. This is a must!"
"Such awesome pizza! Crisp crust, great sauce, and tasty toppings. The only issue is the wait, as they don't take reservations and they're so popular. They should expand!"
Best pizza in Chicago. The wait is rough - always...but worth it. Grab your pager and go next door for a cocktail while you wait!
"I always tell people this place is a hybrid of Giordrano's and Lou's. It's got the pie-stuffed feeling of Giordano's and the delicious buttery crust of Lou's. I'm picky, but I call it the perfect pizza. If you're having dinner prepare to wait an hour for a table and another hour for the pizza. Just remember it's worth be wait."
This place is great! Serves is great the pizza is mouth watering. Highly recommend this place!
Amazing pizza! Best deep dish pizza in Chicago!
"I waited to review Pequod's until I had many others under my belt (85+ at this point). I remember loving it about two years ago when I first had it; before I knew anything about the hype. You can argue who has the best deep dish in Chicago, but I want to put a spin on this. If you look at the menu, they call this ""pan"" pizza and I'm glad they do, because I'd consider them the best pan pizza in Chicago, not deep dish. What I'm trying to say is pan pizza is known to be over-compensated on the dough. This is a very doughy pizza. I consider deep dish more balanced with more cheese and toppings and less dough. To each their own. I really like the airiness of the crust. It has a well-cooked bottom crunch, yet a chewy center. The sauce is more savory and is a true sauce, not chunk tomatoes. I hate to say it, but the sausage tasted a little dry and gritty. This is more than likely due to it being cooked on top of the pizza. There was a decent amount of cheese. It was enough, but wouldn't have complained if there was more. Of course I have to mention the caramelized cheese crust. This is the best bite of the pizza and what they are famous for. Don't be alarmed, it does not taste burnt at all! I also got a thin crust pizza. It's nice that they do a braided outer crust. The toppings were abundant and the it was far more cheesy than the pan pizza. I really liked the thin crust. I think everyone should at least get Pequods once to say they did and it may be your new favorite pan pizza. If you like lots of dough, this will be your place."
What is there to state accept this is the best pizza in the city. They take pizza to another level for taste and the restaurant experience is not bad either. They did a remodel some years ago at the Clybourn location to add more seating and to update the look. The crust and the pizza sauce is just magnificent. This place is definitely worth the trip if you are not close to this location. They also have a location in Morton Grove. bon appétit!
"Took a long time to come out and the refills were slow. But the pizza was very good.  We ordered a deep dish with olives, onion and mushrooms."
"I call Lou Malnati's Pizzeria my favorite Chicago pizza chain, but Pequod's may very well be my favorite Chicago pie! The Carmel crust is to die for and is like no other. Very cozy joint in a nice neighborhood. Parking is difficult but worth it. If ever in Chicago and looking for a true Chicago gem this is it!"
Delicious deep dish pizza!! We ordered and got it delivered and the delivery was pretty speedy forDeep dish. Would definitely have it again.
"Three times, three pizzas delicious and warm from the oven. You can't claim yourself a visitor to Chicago until you have brought your stomach here! The best deep dish in Chicago!"
"Second stop on my Chicago pizza tour. And the BEST!A lot smaller then Lou's and Gino's. Reminded me a of a dive restaurant, limited seating area.Not located in the downtown area. Located away from all the tourist stuff.Lunch special is best deep dish pizza deal you can find. Only Monday - Friday 11AM-3PM.Chicago Lunch Special - $4.95 + $.80 + $.80 = $6.55 - 7 Pan Cheese Pizza with Pepperoni & Sausage -  Not tall as other deep dish pizza I had but the toppings were still loaded on. What sets Pequod's apart is that crispy cheese they get on the crust. The crust is already thick and buttery but adding the cheese to crisp up while cooking brings it to another level.No wonder they are always voted top pizza in America!"
"Everything was stellar except that their crust is waaaaaay too thick, even if their cheese, sauce and toppings are on the generous side, as well. I am impressed that despite the thickness of the bread, it was not in any way soggy from the other ingredients piled on top of it. Meatball topping is great. I just cannot abide by their thick bread."
Deep Dish pizza is good. If you're visiting Chicago I would try one of the more popular joints just to avoid the long wait and hit this place when you have more time to try different pizza places. Waited about two hours for a table. The customer diversity was made up of a lot of families and a lot of kids. It was a bit of a mad house but the staff handled everything well.
"I had been meaning to come to Pequod's for the longest time and finally made it here on a Monday night.  Pro tip: Go on a weekday.  We were seated immediately.  My fiancé and I split a deep dish pizza, and it was quite tasty.  Not mindblowingly great enough for me to make the trek back up to Pequod's soon (I live within walking distance of a Gino's, Giordano's, and Lou's), but I certainly enjoyed myself.  The service was kind, and restaurant's atmosphere was comfortable but nothing special.  I would return if in the area!"
"Not a huge deep dish fan but when visiting Chicago, I figure you have to at least have it once. I've done Uno and Lou Malnatis but wanted to give Pequods a shot- it did not disappoint. Really enjoyed the crust versus the overly buttery kind you typical get. Also found it to be a little less doughy overall. Would definitely recommend adding this to your Chicago pizza tour."
"I had made up my mind after trying 3 other famous Chicago pizza places that I just didn't like deep dish pizza. Nothing was really that tasty. That's when a friendly local told me to give it one more try at Pequod's. I love to eat so I accepted the challenge.We took the train out to the nearest stop, but the nearest stop was about a 30 minute walk to the restaurant. It was sort of a good thing because we worked up a big appetite by the time we arrived. The restaurant has a cool neighborhood-y dive vibe, which I liked. It felt more like a college bar than a pizzeria. Seating is very limited and about 20 minutes after we were seated, a huge line of people formed at the hostess stand (they began quoting wait times of 1 to 2 hours)! It takes a while to bake a fresh pizza so don't come here if you are in a hurry. I probably should've taken away 2 stars for their awful instant iced tea. Skip it. So gross. I always lose major respect for restaurants that care too little to fresh brew their own iced tea. It's not that difficult to do! At least the beer list has Lagunitas, a must-have with pizza. I made the mistake of letting my husband order the pizza and opted for a medium with extra pepperoni. Let me tell you, Pequod's understands the concept of ""extra."" This pie was loaded with spicy pepperoni and it was good, but I had to pick off pepperoni to give him because there was so much. I really liked this pizza (didn't love it, but it's good). The crust is very light and fluffy and tastes like beer. It reminded me of a classic pan pizza crust, but the carmelization was amazing! I could eat that part all day long. The sauce was very spicy which I also liked. This isn't a fancy place but the pizza is great. It was worth the walk."
"We are from out of town and went here based on Yelp reviews. We went on a Monday night at 8pm, so we were seated immediately. Take note that even after you order, it's a 45-50 minute wait for the pizza. We ordered the small deep dish pepperoni for the two of us. My husband ate both of his and was full-- I could only eat one. It was really good but the underneath was a bit dry. The caramelized crust was delicious."
"Hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I've ordered delivery from there no less than 25 times in the past couple years and it's consistently exceptional pizza!As a heads up, there's often a wait if you go in person. I'd recommend putting your name in and then heading to grab a drink at the bar next door.Keep it up Pequod's!"
"Omg my favorite deep dish place in Chicago. It's where I bring all of the out of towners for ""real Chicago pizza"". It's also a great date place, right across the street from the movie theater."
"Pequod's is my favorite pizza in Chicago and that is saying a lot because Chicago has terrific pizza.  To give you an example of how great it is, I never order an all veggie pizza because I usually don't feel satisfied unless there is a meat topping.  This is the only place where I will order one because their thin crust pizza is puffy and delicious, they have they perfect amount of cheese and their seasoning is so good.  Of course their thick crust pizza is wonderful too.  You can't miss with anything you order."
It's one of my top 2 for pizza in a city that has more choices than any other. Only downside is it's so busy that you need to order early - that pretty much tells you how good it is!
It may have been better a few years back but it's still arguably the best pizza on earth and easily Chicago best deep dish. I've regularly had all the spots to hit and Pequads is clear numero Uno! I hit it everytime I'm in Chicago
"My second favorite deep dish spot in Chicago, right behind Art of Pizza. But if a buddy comes into town wanting deep dish, go here for the beer and atmosphere over Art of Pizza."
Amazing pizza!! A must have when visiting Chicago. Great selection of appetizers and beer.
"Pequod's isn't the best pizza in Chicago, it's the best pizza on the planet!  The caramelized crust is to die for!  After living here for 20+ years, this is my go to place to amaze out-of-towners on our best local pizza.  Pro tip:  the personal pan pizza lunch special gets you maximum caramelized crust for minimal wait time.  Enjoy!"
"Pequod's is the only deep dish pizza that I recommend to friends and family visiting Chicago.  Other pizzerias tend to have a spongey crust that gets soggy towards the end of the meal, but Pequod's caramelized crust holds up to the weight of the ingredients on top much better. Quick tip:  Instead of sharing a medium pizza between two people, get two personalized pizzas for more caramelized crust."
"With all deep dish options in Chicago, this one by far takes the pie. The buttery crust supports the cheese to sauce ratio and the no-chain vibe makes it feel much less touristy."
My favorite 'deep dish' in town. FYI- it takes 45 minutes to prepare from time of order. The caramelized cheese crust is delicious.  Not too heavy. The sauce is super yummy too. Staff was friendly. Will definitely be back & will shoot to bring visitors here instead of the more familiar choices.
If you don't get the caramelized crust you're not doing it right. And the sauce... ooooooh the sauce... I love this place
"No double about it, Pequad's has the best pizza in Chicago! Hands down!"
Absolutely my favorite pizza in the city. A unique take on deep dish with a delicious crispy cheese crust. Would recommend the pepperoni banana pepper toppings - so good. Long waits if you go in person pretty often but ordering takeout works great.
Awesome food Greta service very enjoyable will be back!
"Deep Dish! I literally came from New York to try this pizza! My girlfriend is a Pizza lover, so after asking around and doing some research we landed in Pequads! The cast-iron plate makes a big difference, and as my pallet continues to evolve you can taste the different seasoning! Worth the travel!  Check out my instagram for places to visit and eat @expensive_appetite"
One of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago hands down!the pizza is always good the long wait is the only major downside to pequods.
"Sweet sauce, amazing crust and perfect amount of gooey cheese. The pepperoni was crispy and the pizza wasn't greasy!Totally worth the drive out.Worth the hype!!!"
I went here once. It was a long wait and we had to wait in this little coffee like shop a store down. They must be partnered together. We ordered an appetizer because we knew deep dish would take a while to cook. The food overall was really good and the vibe was chill but the wait was a little long.
"not sure if I like it compared to lou malnati's!service was ok, wait was crazy, crust was a little too greasy for my taste, and atmosphere was extremely crowded"
"One of the best pizza places in Chicago! Great, dive-bar kinda feel to it. Usually very crowded on weekends, so come early or expect to wait. They let you order pizza while you're waiting, which definitely helps. Beer options could be a bit better, but other than that this place is legit."
"Unless you go by yourself like I usually do so you can sit at the bar or unless you go at an odd hour, expect to wait at least an hour.That being said, the wait is totally worth it if you're looking for Chicago Style deep dish pizza. Pequod's does it better than anyone else and it isn't even close. I used to be a huge Lou's fan and still go there as I don't live near Pequod's, but when I have the time & am itching for the best deep dish around, I make the hour train ride to eat the best.What makes Pequod's the best is their perfected crust. Slightly burnt which gives it a crunch without being overly doughy. Their sauce has some zest and is not pure tomato. The zesty sauce gives the pizza some kick. Sauces that are pure tomato are garbage in my opinion. All their ingredients are extremely high quality. Great beer selection as well.If you're itching for deep dish that is head & shoulders above Lou's, look no further than this gem only true Chicagoans know about. Simply the best."
Seriously tasty pies! Nice people too. Gets busy early so don't wait!
"I used to hate Pequod's because I grew up on Giordano's. Well, Pequod's is in fact delicious. The cheesy and buttery crust is just so yum. It totally grew on me. We usually get sausage, which is always a good hearty choice."
One of my Favorite Deep Dish Pizzas in Chicago.. they do it right Love the well done crust
"It took over two hours to eat!  Okay so we had to wait for about twenty minutes, they took our name gave us a buzzer and we went next door to have a drink. We ordered only to have our meal given to the wrong table.  They remade our pizza but burnt it we ordered some appetizers while we waited for pizza three.  The staff was nice but we had to ask them what was happening."
"One word, Amazing! I'm not gonna try to compare it to other pizza joints in Chicago, but this one isn't only about the Pizza, but the ambiance, the service, and the food. Pequod's is more of a locals place to go, so you don't see many tourists. When we go there for dinner on a Saturday, there was a wait of 35 mins. Which from my understanding is a very short wait time for a Saturday night. Once we got our table, we were seating upstairs. It almost felt like a ""Speakeasy Pizza"" joint. This place isn't a ""tourist pizzeria"". It's authentic Chicagoan, packed with Chicagoans. It's very loud[in a good way], people just entertaining their guests, having a good time, chatting, laughing, and enjoying some great pizza."
This pizza is great for both locals and out of towners looking to dig in to some Chicago style deep dish pizza!This is one of the best pizza spots in Chicago!
"Pequod's. Pequod's. Let me count the ways I love you. 1. That caramelized crust: It makes my taste buds water just remember that deliciousness.2. That sauce: not too overpowering but spread evenly across.3. The pepperoni and sausage: delicious flavors that compliment the cheese and the sauce perfectly. 4. The mozzarella sticks: the best I've ever had. The cheese and the breading and  the marinara - they've perfected the formula.5. The Pequod's Salad: a delicious salad with meat and cheese and pepperoncini.I've heard about Pequod's ever since I moved to Chicago in 2010. But I never went ... until last week. And now I've been twice in the less than a week. Because the pizza is amazing. The service is great. Everything is amazing. I've ordered the pan pizza twice with friends and it's amazing. The caramelized cheese with a sturdy, yet flaky crust makes an amazing vehicle for the cheese and sauce and toppings. Every bite is a little taste of heaven. I love pizza of all types but this is incredible. It's officially made it's way into the number 2 spot in my list of favorite pizzas, which had been occupied by Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza for over a decade. But now it goes 1) Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder's pizza pot pies, 2) Pequod's pan pizza, and 3) Lou Malnati's deep dish."
"Fun environment & solid food. One of those ""this is Chicago"" places. Good spot to bring people from out of town (cheese in the shape of a whale!)"
Favorite deep dish / pan place in the city.
"First time in Chicago and Pequod's was the first deep dish pizza place I tried. Now when they say ""deep dish"", they really mean it. This pizza was super thick, heavy on the cheese, and delicious. Not to mention, one slice was all I needed to fill me up. My group of 5 got a large (8 slices) and we had plenty to go around. I'll definitely be coming back!"
"Best deep dish in Chicagoland! Worth the wait to have it done right. Plenty of ingredients, great texture to the dough and just the right amount of cheese.. What a pie!!!!!!"
"Ordered a delivery and it was an'effort' to get GrubHub, etc. to pick up even though PP lists them as a service. That said the two pizzas were terrific."
"From the pizza places that I've tried, this is one of  the best pan (deep dish) local pizza store in the city. I am pretty sure there are many such places..."
Pizza is super tasty. Make sure to get it well done and extra cheese.  Again place is always packed so call ahead of time if you are on a schedule.
"Awesome deep dish. I love getting extra sauce and extra cheese, I learned that from my friend Eric. He is skinny, but he knows how to order some good deep dish pizza."
I thought I didn't like deep dish pizza. Then I ate a pedquods. I apologize for now for my immature dislike of something so damn good. Best pizza in Chicago. Absolutely loved it and could unfortunately eat many many more. So delicious.  Pizza was available late as well which is great after a fun night in Chicago. A must try!
Pretty darn good but  not earth shattering.  We showed up around 5:00 pm before the rush.  Parking was available and pizza came out pretty fast.  I think our server forgot about us as we sat there for about 20 minutes waiting for the check.  I'd try it again though.
"My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. Eating at the restaurant takes a lot of patience as the wait times are usually very long. I ate there the first few times but got tired of it, figured that it would be more convenient to just carry out and enjoy the pizza at home. The spinach and jalapeno combination of deep dish is my favorite."
Very good service and food we split the appetizer platter and had a personal pan pizza. Not your typical deep dish ver good crust a bit thinner pizza game changer you must try if you love pie!
"Hands down, best pizza in Chicago. If anyone tells you differently, they're lying. Thin crust or pan, both are amazing. The Chicago chain pizza restaurants can't even compare."
"Bruh. Why does this place exist and can I have one for Christmas? Best pizza in the city, hands down. I don't even like deep dish pizza and I will eat an entire pan pizza by myself and not share. The burnt, crispy crust is the business. The sauce and toppings are fresh and tasty. My go to for pizza."
SOOO Good. Really really good if you like pizza in the form of pizza bread style.. hope that makes sense. So yummy in my tummy!
This was my first experience with Chicago style pizza. Holy cow - worth the wait! (Because if you wanna eat there- there'll probably be one!!) bonus - great left overs!!
"I consider this the best deep-dish in Chicago, but ironically the menu says that they serve ""pan pizza."" From what I can tell, the main difference is that the crust is slightly less thick/tall, but Pequod's makes up for it with an unprecedented crispy and flavorful crust, which is rewarding given that so many deep-dish crusts are just soggy barriers for the delicious fillings. This place just barely beats Lou Malnati's for best Chicago deep-dish.Read about 4 other top Chicago restaurants on Cat the Critic: catthecritic.wordpress.c…"
Fantastic pizza! We love how the cheese was well done on the edges and the crust was perfection. We got there around 1:30 in the afternoon and got into a booth right away. By the time we left there was a long line of people standing along with a few sitting outside. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and we really enjoyed the chill vibe there. Definitely a place to put on your list if you are visiting Chicago.
I could talk about the pizza but it would be a bit of a broken record at this point. I wanted to write a review for the hosts at Pequods. Shout out to the hosts/hostesses at this place for seemingly always being able to keep their cool and get people seated. I get anxiety just thinking about how hard it must be to manage those wait times/tables etc. Good for you guys - keep killing it.
This pizza was awesome... Loved the crust! I had cheese and my brother had sausage and we were both very happy. Service could have been a little better especially since it wasn't busy but the food was great:)
Best pizza I've ever eaten in my entire life! Not even exaggerating... they also have a pretty decent beer selection which makes this place a 5 star review. This is a MUST if you are visiting Chicago!
"This is as good as it gets.It'll be busy, but my group of three saw an opening at the bar and went for it.  The bartender was quick to serve us, and always checked in on us.  It was an early afternoon, so we just wanted pizza.  Every bite is fantastic, and I savored for the crust at the end.  Seriously, one of the best pizzas I've ever had.It's very filling.  The 14-inch pizza was too big for the three of us, and this includes two with huge appetites."
"This was so far out of our way, but I was told by a friend to go.  This hidden gem was worth the trek.   This is a hole in the wall, locals only bar with great pizza.  This is not a tourist stop and shouldn't be.  We were able to get a cold beer and a personal pizza for lunch.  The pizzas were everything I hoped a Chicago pizza should be.  Our service was outstanding.  I was a little concerned when we walked in, but the entire staff did a great job.  They were very friendly."
"Very good pan pizza, crust with the cheese is awesome generous in the cheese I really liked the sausage and the veggie as well."
"This is as legit as it gets to chill with some buddies or significant other in a very casual environment.  The thing to get is there pan pizza and a couple of beers, end of story.  No particular ingredients, anything tastes great!  If you are looking for a good pizza place to visit at night, look no further!  Super chill staff.  You will feel right at home."
"Best deep dish in the city! It of course takes about 45 minutes to cook the pizza once you're there, but then it's worth it. Fun neighborhood joint with amazing pizza."
"Deep dish pizza is as good as it gets. Pequod's is known for their caramelized crust and the staff is super-friendly. If you want to dine in, I suggest placing a ""dine in"" order at least a few hours before you go. If you say you'll be there at 7pm, when you get there at 7pm, your food is ready to be served. I don't know if they offer the same service on weekends but definitely call to ask."
"IT'S SO GOOD! The crust, man, it's the absolute best. I get the veggie or some variation of a veggie pizza and it's just so good. The service has always been decent. They a little bourgeois  (bougie) though, maybe it's just me. The hostess's for the most part be stale as hell, I tip my 20% boo, boo.  It's alright, I don't if they still doing it, but between 11 AM-3PM M-F they have deals."
This place is a Chicago gem! It's the absolute best. Such a laid back vibe and amazing pizza to go along with it.
"THE BEST OF THE BEST! Do not waste your time going to Lou Malnati's or Giordano's. Pequod's is where it's at! I'm from South Jersey and am all about crispy, thin crust pizza. However, I actually debated my deep devoutness and commitment to thin crust pizza after taking just one bite of my personal deep dish mushroom pizza from Pequod's.I would be satisfied eating the crust alone, that's how delicious it really is. The crust is made from basically cheese that crisps and caramelizes while cooking. The inside of the pizza is not as dense as I would have expected from a deep dish pizza. It was creamy, light, and I didn't feel gross after chowing.I could write so much more about how unreal their pizza is, but I would prefer that my mouth stop watering."
"Amazing deep dish. Get the pepperoni, caramelized crust is to die for. The long wait is worth it and the service is generally fast. Put in your deep dish order right away because it does take about 40 minutes. Awesome place to gather with buddies."
Best pizza in Chicago by far! Im not a fan of crust on any of my food but when I'm eating this pizza its my favorite part. I dined at the one in Morton Grove for my boyfriends 21st birthday & tonight this one. I personally like the Chicago location better but both have just as great pizza & service.
"Pick up is the way to go, as the pizza is still piping hot and fresh when you get home. I could eat that carmelized crust all by itself. Hands down, Pequod's has the best crust and pizza. Their proportions are perfect, as I find other places' dough/crust to be too heavy. Their sausage is amazing...really a stand out sausage. I usually get a sausage and pepperoni combo and another with green pepper and onion. While I can eat a lot, pizza is usually filling, but for Pequod's, I make sure I eat at least 4 pan slices since I love it so much. Diminishing utility with the more I consume doesn't really exist here at Pequod's.On another trip, tried the Italian beef and giardiniera. This was on point and they did it right, though sausage remains my preference.To note, I actually prefer NY thin slices but Pequod's pan pizza is that phenomenal."
"Pequod's has the deep dish pizza that I was looking for! We had a late lunch after walking to Pequod's from the Lincoln Park Zoo. It was 30+ minutes for our pizza to arrive, and the wait was worth it! We had the pan pizza with spinach, mushroom, and 1/2 order of sausage (for the husband). You pay for each topping, so we didn't go overboard. Bottom crust was thicker than at Lou's Malnati's which was what I was looking for. The caramelized crust was good and there was a generous amount of toppings. You get full quickly after one piece, but we had to finish it all as we were flying back home that evening. I noticed that the pizza was a bit saltier which was probably due to the cheese. The restaurant was larger than I expected with two levels and there was a private section in the back of the second level. Guess this is a good place for birthdays since we saw several large parties eating here."
"This is some of the best deep dish pizza I've ever had in Chicago. It's busy for a reason. Make reservations, it's worth it. Lots of choice. Deep dish, I recommend over thin crust but they were both good. Good appetizers and plenty of choice with the beer selection.Child friendly, they even had creations and drawings for the kids, remember it more like your local bar than a restaurant. Very nice staff.Enjoy"
"There was so much hype about Pequod's Pizzeria that my husband, a friend, and I finally checked it out. It was extraordinarily busy, but we were seated quite quickly. The service was also prompt despite the norm of having to wait 45 minutes for a stuffed pizza at any establishment. Our server kept appetizers and drinks coming while we waited. The pizza was good. Was it as good as my favorite Chicago stuffed pizza? No, it wasn't quite that good in my opinion. Nevertheless, Pequod's offers a very solid Chicago style pie that everyone should check out at least once."
"I had one opportunity to try deep dish pizza. there were several places I could have chose from, but I picked here. I had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, and then another 40 minutes for my pizza. Waiting for your food here is like a quest. Its not easy, and there are times you want to quit. But patience is rewarded with their damn good pizzas. I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage. It was just enough for two hungry people, and we were definitely full afterwards. Service is not good, but its not bad either. Our waitress attended to us within a reasonable time, considering it was a full house. The crust gets alot of attention here, but I think the best part is the combination of everything. The main player in this pizza is the bread. Usually a hunk of bread that thick would be dry and disappointing. Here, the pizza is fluffy and moist. The toppings burst with flavor. I still dont know whether I like the pepperoni or the sausage more. The cheese was just enough to be gooey but not overwhelming. They could have added a little more sauce, but I think I preferred it on the less saucy side. the caramel crust was cooked just right, but its not mind blowing as some people make it. Overall, it was an excellent meal. Not too salty, not too greasy, and not too saucy (which gives me heartburn). considering this pizza was neither of these things is quite an accomplishment."
"Really good pizza. I've had the classics like Lou Malnati's and Giordano's and Uno's but this is great in a different way. The wait (almost an hour) was not fun which is why I took off one star but the service was excellent and the pizza is superb. The sauce is a little sweet which might not be to everyone's tastes but I was really enjoying it. The crust was unique too. It looks kind of burnt but it's actually just carmalized and it has a splendid taste. I'd definitely recommend this place. Good job, Pequod's!"
"I am not a deep dish pizza person - I grew up on thin crust in our very Italian household - but I must stay this is very good pizza.  Not only that, the ambiance it very fun.  It's always a great place for us to visit during our Christmas Week-end on the city!"
"This was the first time I had proper pan pizza -- and I loved it! Usually I'm a thin crust type of girl and of course once in a while I  crave my Lou and my Gino's, but pan pizza was never that appealing to me. BF's craving led us to this place, and I immediately loved the ambiance. We were seated upstairs and our order was taken fairly quickly. We started with the combo appetizer and I immediate fell in love with the mozzarella sticks and mushroom poppers. They were hot, crispy and tasted fresh. For the pizza, it took them about 30-40mins to get it to us. We had sausage and pepperoni with 1/2 mushroom and 1/2 peppers. They did not skimp on the toppings. I really liked the bread to cheese to topping proportion for the most part, and with just a drop of cholula, I loved my bites. We had 2 leftover pieces from a medium pizza, and when eating it the next day, I could taste the bread way more than anything else and that's when the proportion seemed off.Other than that, I definitely enjoyed my time there."
"This is the pizzeria you go to in Chicago if you don't want to feel like a tourist. Lou Malnati's and Giordano's may be more famous, but I couldn't care less. Pequod's serves the best pizza in Chicago! Their secret is layering the edge of the pan with cheese so that it's baked into the crust, giving it an amazingly delicious flavor that's highly addicting. The pizzas are made to order and you can pick and choose whatever toppings you want. Because of this, it could take 20-40 minutes to get your pizza, but that's totally fine because you can kill time with pitchers of beer or whatever sporting event is on at the time."
"Pizza is one of the best you'll have. Definitely 5 stars. Downfall: the wait is excruciating (especially when you're hungry). Also, up stairs can get a little hot since they don't have A/C. The seating is definitely tight. This place is super popular so as long as you have the right expectations on waiting times, you'll enjoy it!"
"I came to Chicago for one thing. DEEP DISH PIZZA. Lunch special. $4.99 Monday-Friday. 11am-3pm. The special includes cheese pizza with a soda.  If this was available back in Los Angeles, you would find me here everyday.I added sausage, pepperoni and mushroom. It does take awhile for it to be cooked roughly 30-45 minutes. Totally worth it. The pizza is a bit bready but I totaled love it. Especially the burnt crisp. Ugh i'm salviating as I write this and wish I could eat it right now.Definitely a personal size is perfect for a person and I eat quite a LOT. I was totally stuffed after eating this.This spot is the spot. I tried the other competitors and this one ended up being my favorite. I came here twice before leaving Chicago. Now i'm sad that I can't eat this pizza anymore."
"Goodness gracious this place is magical. My favorite Chicago pizza spot by far. I take everyone visiting the city here and have yet to find an unimpressed customer that I've brought in. If you're planning on lunch, you should be able to get a table pretty quick. Towards the late afternoon/dinner time, I'd recommend making a reservation. LONG wait times, so be prepared otherwise!"
Possibly the best pizza I have ever had. What i liked most was that it wasnt overly cheesy like some other Chicago establishments. Be warned that portions are huge - my gf and i couldnt finish a small pizza.
"Some of the greatest pizza in Chicago, and you can trust me since I know pizza. The crust is a game changer, cheese is real nice and gooey. Wait times can be long, but bearable. I'd suggest a seat at the bar for best service."
"This is my first time visiting Chicago (lifelong Californian) and I was blown away by the deep dish pizza here. I didn't know pizza could be this good! Great service, great experience. Pequod's will be my go-to pizza place for the rest of my assignment here."
This place is great.   Best pizza in Chicago.  Now the wait is unbelievable   I called the day prior and asked if I could make reservations.   Well they don't do reservations but you can call ahead.  So I called ahead at 4pm for a table at 7pm and a when we got there they said there would be a 90 min wait.   So please order ahead and the best thing to do is take out.   It's very good.   I have tried a variety of pizzas in Chicago and this one is the best.
The best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Hands down. Small(ish) so come early or plan on a short wait.
"Best deep dish pizza in the city! Generally always a wait when you dine in, so plan accordingly. However their pizza is worth the wait."
"My favorite deep dish place in Chicago!!! I love that they are open until 2:00 AM, which means I can satisfy my late night cravings. You can do RESERVATIONS (priority seating) online! Convenient, and if for whatever reason the time or day is already reserved, the manager will e-mail you telling you a different time or day he can do. We had a group of 14 on a Saturday and they were jam packed! We were seated on the second floor because of our bigger group. They gave us 5 high raise circle tables because they didn't have the shorter rectangle ones. That was the only weird part because some people had to deal with ""indents"" where they were sitting. Like you can just imagine connecting 5 small circle tables in a row and how some people would get stuck in the part where two tables meet. BUT I DIDN'T CARE, because the most important part was seeing my friends. I'm just letting you know in case you plan on bringing a big group on a busy day. [They do allow you to split 14 credit cards, it's a hassle but we didn't have cash]I also can't comment on the service, but because they were busy, you can't expect the constant service. They seemed to have plenty of workers, but still couldn't keep up with the crowd demands, The waiters were flying all over the place and I struggled to find my waiter maybe 2-3 times and kept going to other waiters. But none of them were rude about helping me even though we weren't their table. A funny thing I noticed is that they waiters have a habit of dropping plates (used) or glasses on the ground! I think there were 3 major spills during the 3 hours we were there."
"This was my second time visiting Chicago and I've had the opportunity to try about 10 different deep dish pizza restaurants. All have been very very good. Tuff to even put them in order; but Pequods has become my favorite. Amazing sauce, sausage, peppers and cheese. I also like the way they bake theirs a little bit more than most places, therefore the crust is crunchy. The wait time could be up to an hour, just like all the other popular pizza places, depending on what time/day you go. Nice local crowd creates a great ambiance as well."
Easily one of the best pizza places in Chicago! Always a long line since the food is so good!
"The best pizza in Chicago hands down! The pizza does take a while to bake but when you have it it's definitely worth every bite! I love the crust, every bit is crunchy on the crust!"
"Wonderful pan pizza with a delightful golden ring of cheese baked around the crust. Not ""deep dish"" in the classical Chicago sense, but damn good pizza!"
"Every time I visit Chicago, I go out of my way to make it to Pequod's. The crust is buttery, flaky and perfectly crisp. According to them, the crust is caramelized. The cheese, sauce and toppings make this some of the best pizza I've ever had. On my most recent visit, I came at lunchtime and got the 7 inch personal pizza with sausage and black olives. The lunch special comes with a fountain drink for $4.95. I added the toppings so my total was under $7.50. It was delicious and cheap!A few things to note:*It takes awhile to get your pizza (at least 30 minutes but could be 45 minutes if they are busy), so if you are in a hurry, probably not your best bet.*They have great craft beer choices to go with your pizza.*It can get really busy so lunch or a weeknight be a good option.*You MUST go here :)Make sure to check out this amazing pizza place if you live or are in Chicago!"
Excellent! great deep dish pizza amazing thin crust. The staff is always friendly and the ambiance is great. By far the best pizza in the city!!!!
"After asking everyone we encountered for a pizza recommendation we ended up here.... apparently this is where the locals go! The restaurant has 2 floors and nothing out of this world in terms of appearance. Staff was very nice, we ordered their deep dish Supreme. The pizza was good but if I was to go again I would stick to just plain cheese or pepperoni as I think the combination of the sauce and toppings was overwhelming but tasty nonetheless. The garlic cheese bread is highly recommended. I have a good overall experience and would recommend."
"Pequod's is one of the best pizza places in the city. It's a small, friendly environment with good food and drinks. It gets crowded at dinner time so come a bit early to avoid long wait times!"
I finally went and now know what the fuss is about.GREAT pizza and good service. Be prepared to wait.I have ordered from here for delivery too.  The place and environment are worth it though.
"Being from NJ/NY area we are big on pizza in general. I have a couple spots in Jersey that make a good deep dish. So, we tried Giordanos because it's the ""best"", along with pizza uno too. Giordanos sucked, I can get better pizza at 7/11.So, we get to Pequod's I order a personal pie and it was incredible, half onions and half sausage. It was a solid 8.5-9 . Crust was perfect, some deep dish places or pizza in general get a flaky crust and I can't stand it. Their pizza sauce had an interesting twist to it, not sure if it had wine/brandy/sherry in it. But man what a delicious twist.Great job and we didn't wait too long either"
"Hands down the best pan / deep dish pizza in Chicago. The fresh locally sourced veggies, the pizza crust, the sauce are all top notch!!!!!!"
"They're making pizza the right way here. I'm not a huge fan of the traditional Chicago deep dish style- but Peaquod's really nails it.The pizza pub atmosphere is great for a few draft beers and a couple slices. They make the pizza in such a way that the crust and end of the pizza is carmelized giving a crunchy bite of cheese. It's simply good, and unique from the other deep dish spots in the area.Can't miss this one!"
"This was our final deep dish pizza experience before we left Chicago, and it did not disappoint, the crust was nice and crispy and the pizza had a nice velvety texture, plus the sauce was quite tasty. We didn't have to wait for a table which was nice"
"The food is great, the rattlesnake of a host leaves a bit to be desired.  But the wait staff is friendly and Noelle was very attentive even though she was the only server there.  Wings are good.  Sausage and Pepperoni Large pie was delicious."
I'm a thin crust fan but Pequods is my favorite deeper dish. The wait is long but the pizza is worth it.
"The deep dish pizza is a must-try and a cannot miss. Enjoy delicious toppings, quality ingredients and friendly service. Be warned - bathrooms are a little rough, but they also have a late night bar so that would explain it."
"Hands down, best deep dish pizza in the city. I have tried several places throughout the city and there's a reason there's always a wait for this place despite the number of tables it has. Plus the prices can't be beat. You'll pay more at any of the big 4 pizza places (Gino's, Giordano's, Lou's, Uno). If you want just one slice, head to Art of Pizza. You're welcome in advance."
"As always, Pequods is amazing pizza.  You will have a wait but it's phenomenal pizza and great calamari."
Stop looking for a better Pizza any way I see it they are tops in Chicago. But why the name of Moby Dicks boat? Interesting fact! Great place to go!
"We're a pizza hut household however when we want a fancier pizza option we typically go to Bricks, Stella Barra or Pequod's. Pequod's pan pizza is un-matched and so delicious. It's perfect for movie nights and has a relaxed, casual atmosphere I appreciate. I just wish they had more locations and weren't always so busy!"
"Pretty damn good deep dish! The tomato bisque soup was also yummy. The appetizer sampler wasn't that great, but we ordered it since we knew the wait would be long. If not for the app, 5 stars!"
"With chains like Giordano's and Lou Malnati's serving up deep dish in Chicago, Pequods is certainly a hidden gem. However, it is my FAVORITE deep dish pizza in Chicago and I never fail to mention it to those looking to try deep dish for the first time. I took my family here and they also agreed it was the best pizza they've ever had.There's more of a sports bar vibe from Pequods than from the other chain restaurants, it's often dark, open late, and there can be tons of people depending of if there's a game or not. What sets Pequods apart is their crust on the deep dish. It's perfectly cooked so that it's carmelized and crispy which makes the pizza that much better. You can't get crust like that elsewhere. Keep in mind that deep dish pizza can take a while to cook so either be prepared to wait (it's worth it) or order some appetizers in the mean time. On weekdays, you can call in and order ahead of time so that the pizza will come out faster once you've arrived. They also don't take reservations so on weekends and nights when there's a sporting event get there early or be prepared to put down your name and wait."
"I ate the crust and I don't usually eat crusts. I ordered onion, garlic, green bell pepper, and spinach. There were a lot of toppings, so many toppings they were coming off the pizza and I even got a bonus green olive and some red peppers. I was full after 1-1/2 slices. The only downside was over an hour for delivery, but luckily I wasn't hungry when I ordered."
"Definitely 3.5-4 stars. We waited over 1 hour to be seated, even though we were supposedly on a priority seating list. The restaurant itself was really neat- two stories but still very cozy. We waited over an hour for our deep dish pizza to come (our waitress thought they might have forgotten about it). It was good, but if this is the best deep dish pizza gets, I guess I'm just not a fan. The beers on tap were excellent and overall I enjoyed the experience."
Best Chicago pizza hands down the crust is amazing. Extra red sauce is key.
"Open opinion time, peqouds is my new favorite Chicago deep dish pizza place. This location is big and the servers are friendly though it seems a bit unorganized as we had a few people waiting on us."
"Came here once as it came highly recommended.  I'd say it's my second favorite deep dish to Lou's.  Had to get extra sauce which I'd recommend to break the huge amount of cheese on the pie.  We waited probably an hour before we were able to get some bar seats which was fine.  I'd go back, but not worth waiting a long time."
This was my first time in Chicago and I couldn't have the complete tourist experience without a taste of deep dish pizza.  This place definitely delivered!  I'm a New York pizza kinda girl and a little skeptical about this infamous deep dish pizza but the caramelized crust is absolutely delicious and all the oooey goooey cheese is what dreams are made of.  You do have to wait a while for the pizza but I am telling you it is totally worth it.
"Lovveee their deep dish (pan pizza)! I would seriously rank this place as my second or first choice for deep dish in Chicago! I have a group of friends whom which we go to a different pizza joint every week. We have tried Giordanos, Ginos, Lous, Piece, Dantes, Boiler Room and this place is a great place for deep dish! Service at the restaurant was great! Our waitress was very friendly and took good care of us... she joked around with us the entire time we were there. Another thing I really appreciated about this place was that we told a staff member who brought the pizza to the table that we were excited to try this pizza and wanted to compare to other we have tried. He instead of bashing or bad mouthing other pizza joints given he works there instead talked about other pizza joints he visits or which other pizza he would recommend we tried! I thought that was pretty awesome!I will def be back in the near future to have more of that yumminess!!!"
"After disappointing tries of the deep dish all around Chicago, Pequod's met the mark. Pequod's serves personal deep dish pizzas at a very reasonable price and minimal wait time. I would go back again, if I was in the neighbourhood!"
I tried Lou's but I liked Pequads better the inside of the restaurant is darker and the pizza crust and bottom are burnt in those big black pans they use. Great sauce it's near the Lincoln park area which is a pretty cool area of Chicago go there and be prepared to be full!
"My friends and I went here for a late lunch and it was my only experience of deep dish pizza while in Chicago. The place was packed, even at 3 PM on a Saturday afternoon but we were seated promptly. The service was sufficient, nothing to write home about. The pizzas were tasty, very generous on the toppings and the marinary sauce was yummy! We had the house made meatballs (10/10 would recommend) and ham and pineapple and both were pretty tasty. The wait time is about 40 minutes so make sure you put your order earlier rather than later."
"YES!believe all the buzz and fuzz you read online! this place is great.  The service is great, the food comes out fast even though they are BUSY...Friendly wait staff and the pizza! oh the pizza! it's so good!Only negative part is sometimes the wait, but it's totally worth it!"
Amazing amazing pizza!!!!  Best deep dish ever!!!  Loved it!!!!  Will be back for sure !!!
"Pequod's and a movie - could there BE a better date night? Nope!Located right across the street from Regal Webster Place 11, Pequod's has THE best deep dish pizza. I'm not generally a deep dish fan but the caramelized crust can't be beat. Also, their deep dish tends to be on the saucy side which is key for me.The place itself is authentic, narrow and too damn crowded. I prefer the second floor where there's slightly more elbow room. We always call in advance to make a reservation, thereby cutting the wait time in half."
"Pequod's stole a pizza my heart. This is the best 'za in town! My wife and I dined in last weekend and are still talking about that caramelized crust! I don't think we'll be eating Giordano's anytime soon. The service was great too. Erin and Alan took good care of us...my mouth was watering when that first slice got cut and placed gently on my dinner plate. Goodness, I've gotta get back to this joint ASAP. God Bless Pequod's! PS - If for some strange reason you don't like the pizza from this spot, you're a weirdough!"
"My husband a huge fan, Pizza crust made by angels. Not sure how they get it to crispy - yet thick; sauce and toppings were excellent. Fast service- friendly - parking ok"
"I went to this place with high expectations........I will say that i think it was below my expectations. We waited about 1.5 hours to be seated. The best part was that there is a bar ""The Drinkingbird"" next door and we were able to drink and wait there so that worked out. I'm pretty easy going so the wait didnt bother me....tequila makes everything better anyway. I think i did myself a disservice by ordering the deep dish in a ""personal"" size.  We ordered two personal sized deep dish pizzas so that we could try two different types. I think you definitely gotta go for a bigger pizza to get the full effect. We also ordered the sampler appetizer and i really enjoyed that. I'm definitely going to give this place another shot next time I visit chicago to confirm my feelings! lol Thanks guys!"
The place is awesome the personal deep could feed a army I ate 1/3 of the pizza and was stuffed. I have also tried the Italian beef there one of the best.
"Great delivery service and good prices. The deep dish was a bit too ""bready"" but overall, it was good."
"Came here late on a weekday evening. Their pan pizza is so good!! Wasn't busy at all, had a good time."
Hands down the best Chicago pizza experience.  Get there early and grab a drink next door.
"Well, I found my favorite pizza in Chicago. This place is awesome. It is in a pretty low key spot on Clybourn just past Webster, slightly busy street, parking is not very easy on the street.If you come past 6pm any night, expect a long wait, we happened to get here right before the evening rush and did not have to wait, and if you're coming in on a weekend, there is usually a very long line outside, but it's worth the wait!We sat upstairs, it's a very cool/ fun vibe all over. There are a few TV's around, but nothing too overwhelming and everyone that works here is really nice. We started with a house salad, big enough to share, and then we went to the pizza... We ordered the Medium pan pizza, we each only ate one slice it was so delicious and filling. You choose your own toppings, they don't have any set pizzas on the menu, and the pizza was divine. The crust is sweet, buttery and savory in one heavenly bite, along with the sauce and toppings, it's just amazing. I will for sure be back! :)"
If you love pizza the way I love pizza then this is the spot to go! Pequods is Pizza Heaven. I have tried multiple pizza spots and this one is my number one in Chicago. I can start from the unique buttery and tasty deep dish burnt crust to the perfect amount of sauce and cheese with the toppings! Totally worth the cheat meal and food comma. It is usually packed so prepare to wait for at least 30 minutes to be seated on weekends. Once you're seated the service is legit. Pequods is a must go!
The BEST deep dish pizza in all of Chicago!!!  Don't even waste your time going to the other places. The pizza was the perfect combination of fluffy crunchy cheesy and yummy!!
Best pizza in Chicago. Get a large thick pizza with car Malone's cheese on the sides and fries! Best and favorite pizza and I am from Chicago. Staff is always busy but nice. Love it
Best deep dish in the city. Worth the wait!! The meatball sub is the best I've ever had!
"This review is long overdue. The only bad part about Pequods is delivery...it really is a dine in meal worth every minute of wait time. This, in my humble opinion is the best of the best when it comes to Pizza in this beautiful place we call planet Earth. If you're a Chicagoan, you have to get here often, if you're a tourist it is a MUST STOP AND EAT."
"Absolutely love their deep pan pizza! I think tourists should check this place out! Great atmosphere, great service and amazing mouth watering food!"
"The pizza at Pequods was excellent. I enjoyed it so much. The Deep Dish I had was half pepperoni and sausgage and half pepperoni, sausage, olives and peppers! I reallly enjoyed it (Extra L for emphasis). The Deep Dish was more of a Pan Pizza which had a thick crust. For my first time having true Chicago Deep Dish pizza it was pretty good. Next time Im in Chicago Id like to have the Deep Dish slice that has the toppings in the center and bottom as opposed to the top. Back to Pequods though. The pizza was crunchy and the cheese was perfectly burned along the edges. I thought that it was great. The service was pretty good. The pizza did take a while to arrive, but Im starting to learn that pizza making is a bit of a slow art form.So overall this was great pizza. The toppings were tasty and the pepperoni was really good. Can't wait to get back to the Windy City to have some more. 5 Stars"
Amazing pizza! I went there around 4:30 on a Sunday - no line and just beat the football crowd. The pizza took about 40 minutes to make and the pizza is so cheesy! I love the causal dining environment and very laid back. I will definitely be back next time when I am in town
"I had never heard of this pizzeria before my brother mentioned it to me. We got our pizza delivered in a timely manner, unlike most places. Pizza itself definitely surprised me because it held its own against my all time favorite-Lou's. I dare say I think this was better than any other deep dish pizza I've had to this day... Go try it if you love some classic deep dish style pizza!"
This is easily the best pizza I have had in years.  My order had a couple of custom features (light cheese/extra sauce) to it and they got both of them right.  This is totally uncommon as most places strive only to get the ingredients right.  I had carryout but the dining atmosphere looked great too.  Highly recommend.
"It was very good, wait for the pizza was longer than expected!Bad news, their is nothing like a NY Style pizza from back home in NYC!"
Great deep dish pizza. Sauce and the crust are both excellent. Very generous with toppings. Fun atmosphere with friendly staff.
I love this place !! The pizza and wings are worth the money and annoying parking search.
"Pizza takes fucking forever, but my god it is delicious."
"I've been wanting to come here for a while now. Their's alot of hype about Chicago deep dish pizza. Everyone one I asked recommended this spot, so I had to give it a try.  I knew they would be a long wait but so did everywhere else. I started out with garlic bread to eaze the hunger a bit. When it arrived I was disappointed in the quality of the bread. Tasted like it came from the grocery store so I didn't finish. Then I ordered a salad and it was pretty basic as well, nothing special. They told me to wait for the pizza was 1 hour long, which was fine considering how many people were there. So I actually went next door and got some sushi and brought it back to the pizza place. They were totally cool with it. 20 mins later my DEEP DISH PIZZA showed up and it was HUGE! (I ordered a small btw) having waited this long I was pretty excited to dig in..........................Dam that pizza was worth the wait, and will totally go back. So 5 stars for there pizza but the rest of the food is decent. Which is expected since they specialize in deep dish. Non the less I had a good time and the hostess was nice. Thank you"
I like Peqouds deep dish. Yum. So filling. So satisfying. Reasonable. Decent beer and drink list/menu.Not fancy nor pretentious. Causal.
"Went on a busy Friday night, and when we checked in, there was an hour wait but two seats happened to open up at the bar within about 10 minutes, so we snagged those (bar is first come, first served). We ordered jalapeño poppers and a small sausage and onion deep dish pizza. The bartender got our drinks out quickly and the poppers were out within 10 minutes. They are the cheesy kind, not the cream cheese kind like I am used to, but they were still delicious and not too greasy. The pizza took longer (about 40 minutes) but we were expecting that as there is a big sign on the hostess stand setting that expectation. It was WORTH THE WAIT. The pizza was delicious and the crust was amazing."
"Deep dish pizza at its finest. Truly, it doesn't get any better than this. Beautiful, carmelized crust that is to die for. It's heavy and you'll be full afterwards, but your tummy will be happy.I'm fairly picky when it comes to deep dish, this place hits the mark."
"My girlfriend and I had a bad experience here a few months ago, and I posted about it on Yelp. Within minutes, the manager emailed me to apologize for what happened and told us to come back whenever we wanted and that he would buy us dinner. We did that tonight - and everything was excellent (and free). My girlfriend and I split the Pequod's salad and kept it simple with the pizza (large deep dish wish pepperoni and sausage). We have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow, and the staff and managers couldn't have been nicer to us.I've been to this location probably a half dozen times and will continue to go in the future. Thanks, Pequod's, for your excellent customer service! (And pizza!)"
"Heaven in the form of pizza. Forget the places you've heard about before and go here if you want good, Chicago pizza. The crust is perfect, the cheese ring around the edge is perfect, all around perfect pizza. Anyone who tells you this isn't Chicago pizza is wrong and you don't need that negativity in your life."
"Favorite deep dish/authentic ""Chicago-style"" pizza. If you're from out of town and debating on which to try go to Pequod's! There will probably be a wait, but grab a drink and just relax - you're about to have the best pizza ever. The burnt cheese crust is simply to die for."
"Pequod's Pizzeria, tomato sauce masters! I'm speaking specifically to all my heartburn people out there, this sauce will not keep you up at 3am in the morning, but enough about all that. I came to Pequod's with my girlfriend, Gaby, wanting to try out this heavily hyped pie. The joint was juking, which was to be expected on a Friday night, but it only took us 40 minutes to get seated which was not bad due to the reputation of the joint and the incredible crowd waiting outside (pro tip: you can get ahead of the wait line if you call in for a table the day before). To pass the time we went three doors over to the Drinkingbird and had a couple of Schiltz and PBR's for 3 dollars a pop while we waited. Once our buzzer thing vibrated we rushed over. Walking to our table all I was getting was college/frat vibes (esp. on the second floor) from the decor to the people. I went to UOI, so I'm a natural in this habitat (just wanted to fully disclose for all the anti-bros out there). Once seated we ordered immediately since we already knew what we came for and did not want to drag out the hold time of the pizza. We ordered buffalo wings and a medium pizza (sausage & pepperoni - 1/2 jalapenos). The wings came out immediately and they were really good, the only problem for me was the price of the wings in comparison to the size of the wings. I literally, in one bite, can clean those wings. I drank one beer and a 1/4 of my second beer before the pizza came out which is okay (I like my pizza out before I finish my first beer (I sip lightly everyone, at restaurants only of course lol)). Once the pie arrived, we dug in. The ingredients are to die for, plain and simple. It was GREAT! I can really see what all the hype is about and the fun atmosphere complemented the entire experience. Trust me - if you haven't tried this place, don't let the hold time faze you, you will be rewarded in the end.  *****I will say this though, I AM NOT A FAN OF THE ""CARAMELIZED"" CRUST at the end. Idk if this is an accrued taste like wine or something BUT TO ME IT TASTE BURNT. The cheese and crust underneath the burnt ends tasted great nonetheless.The restaurant as a whole is 4/5 for me - the wings 3/5 (this rating is leaning on the weight of the price) but the stuffed pie was 4.5/5. I will def. recommend this pie to friends and family.Cheers everyone!"
"This is the BEST place for deep dish pizza!My favorite part about the pizza here is how the edges of the crust are slightly burned so it's really crisp. I've tried 3 different deep dish pizza places in one day to compare them all (Pequod's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's) and Pequod's is the best in my opinion! I can't comment on the service here; I always order for pick-up because I'm too impatient to wait, unless I am catching up with some friends and passing time anyway. Keep in mind that you will always have to wait for deep dish pizza if you expect a quality, fresh pizza no matter where you go."
"Deep dish done right. We had our medium pie delivered. While the delivery time was a little longer than what we would've like, the wait was well worth it. In a town with a pizza place on every corner, Pequad's stands apart. Try it, you won't regret it."
"Let me start by saying I am NOT a deep dish fan. It is too much for me, but naturally you have to get one because you are in Chicago. Pequod's is what the locals recommended so we came here to see what it was all about. The pizza's crust isn't that dense thick crust that we all think when we think Deep Dish. This crust was thin and crunchy- very much like a cheese crisp. This is the best deep dish I have ever tasted- the cheese to sauce ratio was all on point. I wish I could say this place has made me a deep dish convert- but that would be a lie. But if you like deep dish then this place will most definitely be your go to spot."
The food was great I ordered a veggie/ jalapeño deep dish with extra cheese and it exceeded my expectations. I would definitely come back!
Best deep dish!! Wish there was a location Southern California!! The sauce was so flavorful and the mozzarella was top quality.
"The wait was reasonable for lunch (10-15minutes), the food was amazing!! It was about 2.5 $s but worth going there cause there's enough food for left overs"
"THE BEST DEEP DISH. Don't let other's persuade you. If you are looking for deep dish, come here. Leave the others behind. All Chicago pizza places have a wait, but this one is worth it. What makes them different from the rest is their amazing crust. Caramelized cheese crust. SO GOOD. Just headed over, do it, right now!"
"Was able to try this and Lou Malnati's while in Chicago and this place is #1 for deep dish in my book. The service was great and the atmosphere was fun. The crust is the specialty here, they pile layers and layers of cheese on the side of the pan, making a cheesy, burnt crust that made it so crunchy and flavorful. And the fact that we were able to choose the toppings was what got me super excited.After a night of drinking, nothing was more satisfying than this, and of course, we had to order more drinks.. We literally piled it high with mounds of toppings! We got mushrooms, jalapenos, fresh garlic, sausage, Italian beef, and hot giardiniera. The giardiniera and Italian beef is definitely a must-get. Can't wait to come back!"
So good. Better then NYC pizza. Worth the wait and the prices. environment is amazing too.
Delicious pizza! The deep dish personal size is very filing. It took about 40 minutes to get our pizza so plan to stay a while and get an appetizer if you're hungry already. We got the cheesy garlic bread and it came out quickly and was very tasty.
45 minute wait for the table then 1 hour and 15 minute wait for the pizza  but it was well worth it!Cooked to perfection. The burnt edges has amazing flavor. The sausage and pepperoni are fresh. Again definitely worth the wait time.
"3 hour wait...3 hours! I thought to myself, there is no way any pizza is worth waiting this long for!We were a group of 7 and killed time at a nearby bar to snack on tacos. When it was our time we headed to the restaurant and took our seats upstairs in a booth under a large tv. The waitress took our orders and we were eating cheesy, bready appetizers within 15 minutes. I tried not to gorge so I could save my real appetite for this infamous pizza. I managed to eat half a appetizer and finally 45 minutes later our pepperoni and sausage pizza arrived. It was freakin amazing. I cherished every bite and wished my stomach was bigger to hold more of this saintly pizza. Others at the table ordered double sausage which was comical because when it arrived we could barely see the crust...there was soooo much sausage! Everyone who ate it said it was too much so don't bother getting a double order, they hook it up plenty without needing that. I left smiling and think this is the best pizza I've ever had in Chicago. It's also very reasonably priced compared to other places. 3 hours is steep though so I'd attempt to go at a down time or order to go."
"5 stars for dining in, 3.5 stars for takeout or delivery. Their pizza is about the best you can get when you eat it fresh at the restaurant - although waiting for a table can sometimes be a pain during prime times. But it is worth it if you have the time. The pizza loses something when you take it to go or have it delivered but it's still very good. There's not much bad to say about Pequod's."
"Pequods is a good as pizza gets. Plus this location is open late, late, late...perfect to hit after the bars in Lincoln Park. The deep dish is excellent. Great Chicago-style done right. Sauce is rich, tomato-y and tasty.The thin crust is also the bomb. Love the pepperoni. Expect to have to wait for a table - especially late at night when everybody else has closed their kitchen. But, trust me, it will be worth the wait."
"This is quite arguably one of my top 2 BEST pizza places I've ever had in my life and I LOVE New York pizza. I'm not a thin vs thick crust guy; I just love good pizza. I've had the chain pizza places in Chicago and although Peq's isn't as deep, that's the beauty of it! You don't get too much bread, or cheese, or with little pepperoni... Peq's is just the perfect balance between bread, cheese, reeeeally love sauce, & pepperoni. & this is why I love this pizza! Plus, you don't get full off 1 slice, I had 3 bc I love to eat and didn't want to eat more because I didn't want to be that hog. Could've easily had 4 comfortably.I'm from Cali and Cali has no good pizza. So when I travel, I try the landmark foods and this is by far the best pizza I've had in Chicago, hands down - in my top 2 pizzas EVER."
"Best pies in the city. Always busy. So be prepared to wait, but definitely worth it. I would recommend them over any other spot even though there are plenty of great pizza spurs in Chi."
"Best pizza in town but be prepared to wait for both delivery and at restaurant eating.   There must be a better delivery system to get you the food faster.   Regardless, it's worth the wait.    Best sausage in town"
"I love Chicago style pan pizza, and this is arguably the best pan pizza in the city (and outside because the morton grove location is great too). It's at least a must try for anyone, and you're crazy if you're not a fan of the crust"
"If I had to eat just one thing for the rest of my life, this place would probably be the one - love love love this pizza joint to death!  It is JAF x 100 - hot peppers and basil all day man on my deep dish.  I love my friend Aamer for introducing this to me, so happy that he is the white guy in a brown guys body for letting me know about this gem of a place.  And whoever says this place is OK or it's not as good as lous or giordanos can really go back to their moms basement and eat tombstone pizza."
"Best deep dish in Chicago, hands down. Not as nice of an atmosphere as some other deep dish chains but this pizza is the best. Ask for water if you want some otherwise they won't bring you any. Usually extremely long wait times."
This is a must try for fans of pan pizza. It is almost always where I take friends when they come to the city. I have never been disappointed!
"Chicago, I love you for many reasons, but your deep dish is high on the list.  Since moving away, every time I've been back, I've gone to Pequod's.  If you're going for dinner, be prepared for a long wait.  Most really great places in Chicago have long waits, so this is to be expected.  Since there isn't a lot of space to actually wait, you can always grab a drink at the bar that is two doors down, and they'll give you a call to let you know your table is ready.I always start off my pizza meals with a salad to get some healthy veggies in.  But when at Pequod's I douse my salad in their ranch dressing because it has a little extra something in it that makes it awesome.  I think it may be extra garlicky or something, and it is great!  Their house salad also comes with cheese on top that shaped like a fish, which is always endearing.  All deep dish places have something they do a little differently.  Here at Pequod's they're known for their caramelized crust, which really sets them apart from the rest of the crowd.  You can't go wrong with any pizza you would choose.  It is some seriously tasty pizza!My last visit in was over the holiday season during lunch time, and there was a bit of wait.  They have a nice little lunch combo for $4.95 that comes with a 7-inch cheese personal pizza and a fountain drink.  Regular toppings are $.80 extra, and you can also add a small lunch salad for a couple extra bucks.  We went this route, and I enjoyed the pizza, but I am firm believer that the personal pizzas at deep dish places are never as good as the full sized pizzas.  Please tell me I'm not alone in thinking this.  I swear it's the cooking time or something.If you haven't tried Pequod's yet, you're missing out!"
This is the best pizza in chicago hands down. the toppings are fresh and the crust and caramelized cheese give the pizza a unique taste unlike any in the city. 5 stars and first recommendation to any of my out of town friends who want to know what chicago deep dish really is
"I give them 5 stars for pizza but subtract 1 star for not being eco friendly. I ordered delivery and mentioned I'd be eating at home so asked for no plastic silverware, and received a plastic bag of plastic silverware for and paper plates for 6 people. It's just for me and my husband.  Why are restaurants so wasteful??"
"I have no idea why nobody opens a place like this anywhere in NYC or Charleston Sc.  I cant find any deep dish pizza anywhere on the east coast for that matter.  I dream about this pizza, it is so satisfying and hearty it really cant be described except overwhelmingly delicious!  And for all of the yelpers who look at the top of the pizza and say; ""why is there so little cheese?""  IT IS UNDERNEATH, they don't pile all of the cheese on top of the sauce, that's a defining characteristic of this type of pizza!!  Come on people get with the program, this ain't NY style."
"I've been going to Pequod's since I was a little kid, and it has remained the best pizza in a city full of great pizza. The carmelized crust is fantastic, and the Pequod's spinach and mushroom deep dish might be the perfect food. The only downside to its recent notoriety is it's busier than it used to be, but it's still utterly wonderful."
"This is my favorite pizzeria , bar none ,and always gets top rankings for their pizza from the many, many restaurant reviews locally and nationally. We've been going there once a week for going for years due to the high quality pizza and great service staff. My only negative would be the whale symbol they use, specifically its eye patch, given today's politics. Know what I mean ?! Love the pizza, the people, and the place. Well worth the trip!"
This was my second time having pequods! The first was a super great experience and everything was delicious. The second time around I went with a group. The service and food was terrible. We ordered appetizers that never arrived. Drinks weren't refilled. The pizza arrived super late and burnt!! We ordered a thin crust veggie and one with sausage. I'm hoping the third time is as good as the first time.
"This is one of my favorite pizza places in Chicago! The caramelized crust pan pizza is delicious and reasonably priced. The place is always busy, especially during the weekends (can be up to 2 hour wait). However, while the pizza is delicious, the location itself needs some work (dirty tables, dirty bathroom, overall could be a cleaner atmosphere)."
"I came alone and was seated promptly at a high two-top table. I'm glad they have a lot of small booths and tables. the iced tea tasted really sweet and definitely not freshly brewed. On the contrary, they do have a rotating Three Floyd's beer on tap, so props for that. To start, I ordered a half Pequod's salad. I enjoyed it as it had a lot of different ingredients like pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese, and onions. The Italian dressing came in a plastic container, like I was taking it to go. The dressing was good, but not thrilling.At 5:30 on a Friday night, it was already 50 minutes for a personal pizza. I ordered a pizza with sausage and mushrooms and added spinach to half. When it arrived it wasn't cut, so there was no picking this pizza up! The caramelized crust was very good, maybe not as good as Burt's crust was. The sausage was phenomenal, great seasoning, nice sized pieces. The spinach was whole leaves, not a chopped up mix like at Gino's East or Lou Malnati's. I coulde taste it, but was glad it didn't overwhelm the rest of the pizza. Also, the pizza tasted really saucy. I like a lot of sauce, but it was to the point where I could barely taste the cheese.The service was...interesting. I had one server through the time that I placed my order. Then, I never saw her again. Another server took care of me the rest of the way. I had to ask if she was my server now and she said yes. I just expected to get some kind of explanation as to why there was a switch. Also, there isn't much space to walk, especially downstairs. I feel for the servers as they have to navigate through some really tight spaces.It was a good experience and I'd enjoy having the pizza again."
"Out of all the highly rated deep-dish spots we bookmarked ahead of time prior to visiting Chicago, this was our favorite pie.  It's a no frills type place and the wait can be easily over an hour and the pies take a bit to come out as well, but this is one place where the wait is worth it.  Our pies had a great crust, perfect amount of sauce, cheese and toppings, would definitely visit again-well worth the hype."
"Pequod's, you truly live up to all the hype everyone is talking about. Pequot's has the best deep dish pizza you will ever taste. Forget Lou Malnati's, Gino's, and Giordano's. They don't even come close to Pequod's.Come early or call-in before you arrive to get on the list. My husband and I came on a Saturday night and were predicted a 2-hour wait. No worries though, we walked to the Drinkbird, just 2 stores down from Pequod's, for a drink while waiting. And shortly after finishing our first drink, we were notified that our table was ready. We waited for ~ 45 minutes before our table was ready. Just in case you were wondering, Barnes and Nobles is out of range for the sensor to work. Trust me, we asked them too. What makes Pequod's so unique is their crust. That caramelized crust is so delicious that there are no words that can properly describe how amazing it tastes. You just have to come and try it yourself. I promise you you won't regret it, and it's worth the wait. You have to pay extra for each topping, but don't worry, they are very generous with their toppings. NOTE: It takes ~45 minutes for your pizza to cook after you order, so you should order an appetizer. Their garlic bread is a great start for an appetizer when you're about to get hangry.If you're Blackhawks fan, you'll love this place even more. :)"
"My FAVORITE pan pizza anywhere!  I order the same damn thing every time: pepperoni/mushrooms/green olives.  It brings me joy.  Like making guacamole, or listening to an old V-8 accelerate on LSD. I especially like how the crust has burnt cheese on it. The pepperoni often has a bit if color too. I will always be a fan!"
"Best deep dish in Chicago. Like most locals, this is a topic we take seriously!! I will fight you on this. Their burnt cheese crust does it for me. As an original Wisconsinite, cheese is important to me. My friends and I agree that Canadian bacon and pineapple here is the best but go crazy and get whatever you want. Add pepperocini! Outside of the food being amazing - it's a fun atmosphere / sports bar. It's also unique and not a huge chain. If you have a weekday free go before 3PM for their awesome $5 personal pizza deal!"
Pequod's is my favorite pizza place. I love their caramelized crust no other place can top it.
True chicagoans choose Pequod's over other famous deep dish pizza places. It's fresh and delicious!
OOooh Pequods carmel crust.. i am gaining weight here.  A bit loud inside but the food is always good and we take the remains home for leftover that last all week.  In fact the pizza has an after life in the microwave oven.  Good stuff so take it home !
"Holy smokes... that crust was amazing.  If I hadn't burnt my mouth trying to scarf this thing down, I'm sure it would have been even more magical.  Until next time."
"My Chicago tour included three different pizzerias in hopes of discovering the best: Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Pequod's. My favorite by far? Pequod's!Each takes a little while to get from ordering to eating, making calling in ahead when possible a wise decision. But flavor? Ohhhh man. Technically a pan pizza I'm told, Pequod's is just dumped with everything the way I want it.It looks a tad like a dive bar walking in, which probably has to do with the time of its founding. By the way, I kind of also like that there's only one location - it gives it more of an authentic, non-chained feel. Even if the service was, well, a little bit distant. Can't win in everything, and in this situation I didn't particularly care, probably due to the dive bar feel.The best part? The pizza, obvi! The lunch special is somewhere around the $5-6 dollar mark (sorry, I forget), including a soft drink, which I didn't very much care for but gratefully accepted, a lemonade. The bread is thick and delicious, a slightly caramelized crust, and flavorful cheese and toppings hold the rest of it together. I threw on their sausages and mushrooms for an incredible delight.When I move to Chicago, I know this will be my to-go spot for sure."
Did not disappoint! Loved the carmalized cheese and the sauce was super tasty! Can't wait to go back.
"Really awesome alternative to the bigger guys like Lou's and Giardiano's. Also, their wings are super underrated"
"We made the fatal error of going to Lou's when ee got off the plane instead of going straight to Pequod's... but now we know the difference between sub par and excellent...Ordered:Thin Crust w/ sausage, mushroom and green peppersNot ever going to order a thin crust pizza outside of NYC again! The dough tasted like the pillsbury instant dough....Deep dish w/ pepperoni, meatball, green peppers and mushrooms.  Mucho bettero! Fresh ingredients, cheesy and the crust had a nice crunch. All worth the calories!Wash it down with some of ""Not your fathers root beer"""
Some of he best pizza and a fun atmosphere. (a bit loud but thats ok)
Delicious pizza!I was in Chicago on business. My BFF from college brought me here with high hopes... And the pizza exceeded my expectations! Delicious! I will go back Everytime I visit.
"Everyone loves their thin crust pizza.  Many I know say it's the best in Chicago.  That's high praise.  It has almost a cult following.  I like it a lot.  I also like some other places for thin.  (This isn't Neapolitan thin, but just regular thin)"
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago!! The crust is crunchy and the sauce is amazing!! Staff is friendly also!!
One of the best pizza places in Chicago.  The lunch special is a particularly good deal.
"We made a reservation and we still had a long wait, so make your reservation as far in advance as you are able. Our waitress was great (split the check between a bunch of college kids' debit cards) and the pizza was delish! Loved the cornmeal crust :)"
"hefty portions of toppings on the 12"" medium pan pizza we ordered. wait staff is extremely helpful and courteous.came on a Saturday afternoon around lunch time, and didn't have to wait for find a table. there is plenty of room, including upstairs preferred seating!"
Good pie if your into deep dish
"you can't go to chicago and not get DEEP DISH PIZZA! so on my short 3 day trip, my friends helped me decide that Pequod's would be the SOLE deep dish i tried in chicagoTHE CRUST, lighter and more crumbly than i've ever had & with a blackened cheese layer on the top of the side, it was a good balance--sausage deep dish: the sausage had a lot of anise but I loved how saucy this pizza was--mushroom with fresh basil & tomatoes: not a fan of the sliced tomatoes but mushrooms never failLOVE that you can get personal pan sizes! i was pretty much full after 3/4th's of this pieit's in a divey sports bar type atmosphere but don't underestimate"
"I usually love this place. This is my favorite deep dish in the city, mostly because they're made in those cast irons, which gives the crust a fantastic crispy caramelized exterior. One time I came, I got a pretty limp pizza though. Trying not to hold it against them."
"Honestly, this is some of the best pizza that I've had in Chicago. I absolutely love the caramelized crust and flavor of these deep dish pizzas. The service is great and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. You can't call yourself a true Chicagoan if you haven't enjoyed Pequod's. And tourists, go out of the way to come here if you can."
"Toppings,Cheese and Sauce very delicious really make the pizza more than decent, the crust tasted super buttery which wasn't the best combination with pizza but ok. The atmosphere was hectic due to Hawks game that was going on. Will definitely visit a quieter time next time."
"When I came to Chicago, I met up with a friend and asked her if we could get some good ole Chicago pizza.  I knew about Giordanno's and Lou Malnati's, but she suggested Pequods, which I never heard of.  Well turns out it was a great choice, and favored by the locals!She said the line might be long, but we got seated pretty quick on a Fri night at 7.  No more than like 20 minutes.  Once we sat down, there were a lot of beers and then the pizza came out.  My god.  It was delicious.  It had that burnt crust taste and all that delicious sauce and fillings.  Next time I get deep dish in Chicago, this will be my first stop."
"Of all the deep dish pizzas I've had while in Chicago, Pequod's comes out on top.  This is the only place that had a crispy crust!  The other places had a much more doughy consistency to them so Pequod's def stands out.  Since the waitress warned that the pizza takes a long time to cook (took about ~40 min)  My friends and I ordered the cheesy bread and chicken strips to help tie us over until the sausage/pepperoni pizza came.  The apps were nothing to write home about but my review is specifically for their deep dish pizza.  The toppings of the pizza was heavenly as well as all the cheese!  I managed to tackle 3.5 slices of that behemoth.  Hands down the best deep dish pizza I've ever had (and probably the longest food coma I've had as well)."
Always great and worth the wait! The pizza is amazing!! Best pizza in the city hands down! I will definitely be back again! Great Staff and Atmosphere!
"The pizza is amazing and the wait was worth it.  The only problem is when the hype is so high you expect greatness.  I would've like the caramelization of the crust would've been done on all of the crust, not just the top.  The bottom layer was a little to thick and was inconsistent with the top layer.  But nonetheless it's definitely a worthy Chicago style pizza."
Caramelized crust is the best ever!! this place is a chicago gem.
"This was suggested to us by multiple people so we ordered in. They quoted us 1.5-2 hours but it took just over 1 hour on a Saturday night. The food had to be warmed up a little, but that just might be because I'm picky. Anyway, we got a medium half cheese, half sausage and green olives. Super good. The crust is more bready than a traditional deep dish style, but the flavoring of the crust is very good. The olives added delicious flavor too. Their cheesy garlic bread was also pretty good! Not just dry bread without flavor. It was a nice lil app. I'd probably come back again and try some other pizzas!"
"Loved it! Pizza was delicious and highly recommend the zucchini bites (ask for a side of marinara to go with the ranch). Prices were fair, good atmosphere!"
"Well you've come to Chicago to try the world famous Chicago Deep Dish PIzza. Are you gonna go to a lame-duck chain restaurant like Uno's? No, I don't think so. You are gonna come to Pequod's to truly experience Deep Dish Pizza. Haven't tried other Deep Dish places in Chicago, but Pequod's lived up to their fame."
"Pequod's is the best in Chicago. Tremendous pizza, truly Chicago. I recommend this to anyone, for what it's worth."
"Differs from other deep dish pizza because the crust at pequods is fluffier and more doughy. There also seemed to be more sauce. I highly recommend trying. However, the restaurant itself is on the smaller side and there was a long wait on Friday night."
"After a movie at Webster this place is awesome.  If you like deep dish pizza with that crispy edge of cheese... oh yeah!  Decent prices and a great lunch special for a slice and drink. There can be a wait sometimes which sucks, but the pizza.... YUMMY!"
I've been in chicago for 6 years now and this is definitely the best pizza I've had so far! Their deep dish crust is amazing. We had both a cheese pizza and a supreme both were awesome. I like the busy dive local feel of the place as well. Service was great and I highly recommend it!
Not sure if this is authentic Chicago pizza but it is probably the best I've ever had.
"This place is famous for its pan pizza.  The caramelized layer of cheese for crust is what makes the pizza here special.  That being said, we had to check this place out!  Upon walking in, I noticed that this place looked more like a bar, rather than a restaurant.  We were seated in a small booth meant for two.  The atmosphere was loud, but that was expected given the bar environment.  The appetizers and the pasta all looked so good.  But we knew we would not be able to finish them all, and still have room to try the amazing pizza!  So, the GF and I just decided we would just order the small pepperoni and mushroom pan pizza. After waiting about fifteen minutes our pizza made its way to our table.  I was surprised with the short wait after because we had dined at Lou Malnati's the prior day.  Our server there  told us the pizza would take 45 minutes to cook.  I thought he was joking at first, but he was not kidding. The pizza was downright delicious.  It was hands down the best deep dish I have ever had in my life.  There was nothing negative that could be said about the pizza.  It was not overly saucy, and they did not cheap out on the toppings.  I loved that the bottom of the pizza was crispy, and not soggy.  I had to use a knife and cut the bottom because it was just that crisp.  The crust was the best part.  It was still so hot, despite eating the crust last.  The cheese was heavenly, for lack of a better word.   I love that this place opens until 2am.  The service was good, and the pizza was amazing.  I would recommend, and will definitely be back."
"If pizza preference measured my city pride I'd be a terrible Chicagoan. Thin crust has always been much more appetizing to me than a block of melted mozzarella. If I must dive into the deep dish though this is the spot I do it. Their caramelized crust really steps the experience up a notch. They don't get the national recognition of Malnati's or Giordano's, but I promise you Pequod's is where it's at if you like feeling like you're pregnant after eating pizza. Lots of topping options, decent sauce to cheese ratio, and again of course that caramelized crust. I don't often do pies this way, but when I do I choose Pequod's."
"Pequods is my guilty pleasure. I. Effing. Love. This. Place. As a Chicagoan, I don't understand how people can still be hung up on Lou's and Gio's with this place around, they pale in comparison. The thin crust here is good but the deep dish pan pizza is to die for! It has a caramelized crust and is cooked to perfection every time. This place never disappoints and by the way, they have a very generous delivery range. My only regret is that it's socially unacceptable to eat pizza everyday so I have to space my Pequods visits adequately."
"I wish I could give this place a 3.5, but I'd rather give it a 4 than a 3. There are many pros and cons.Pros: This place was HUGE. I was surprised to see that they're able to seat so many people. There is an entire section upstairs. It actually two separate sections. The service was good after we got seated. The pizza was decent but did not blow my mind. They tell you how long it will take to cook appetizers and the pizza which is excellent and much appreciated. Good french fries. Great prices on pizza! The crust was nice and fluffy! Even when I ate it cold the next day after I had it in my purse for 5 hours (don't judge me), it tasted great.Cons: There are kind of a lot. They told us 30 minutes to get seated (long), BUT the time was accurate and they actually sat us in 30 minutes. We ordered drinks and they came out quickly, but the drinks were pricey. I paid $5.95 for a pint, and those were the prices for almost all of their beers. We ordered half an order of fries and bruschetta. The fries were really tasty but I wish I had a bottle of ketchup rather than packets. The bruschetta was not good. It was bland and the bread had this weird orange color to it. I ordered a pan sized personal pizza and the size was perfect for me and I had half the pizza leftover. I ordered pepperoni with basil. My pizza was burned AND I really hate it when the basil is cooked with the pizza. Fresh basil should not be cooked in my opinion. The delicious taste of it goes away. It didn't taste fresh by any means :(Overall, someone said we had to try it so we did. I'm not upset about it, I don't regret it, I may go back, but it didn't blow my mind."
"The best pizza! Love this crispy cheese heaven. The wait is long, but always worth it."
"As good as it gets! I have gluten and dairy issues so I don't eat pizza very often, but when I do, I prefer Pequod's over everything else. I used to go here after concerts and they'd be slammed, but I'd wait an hour anyway!"
Pizza was wonderful. A little tight quarters but who cares the service was great. Great place to sample Chicago pizza!  Here after a wedding rehearsal.
"Really like this place. The crust of this pizza is the best thing ever. The pizza tastes really fresh but sadly takes 45 minutes to make! I would suggest coming here right when Pequod's opens BEFORE everyone files in for the football game happening that weekend. Another thing, if you're really into cheese, Pequod's is not the cheesiest of the deep dish places. So, if you're looking for something like that, I'd either get the cheese pizza (or ask for more cheese) or check out Lou Malnati's or Giordano's."
"Best Pan Pizza I've had in Chicago (so far). Real good flavor, nice crust, even a bit light (for pan pizza).  Rest of the menu was okay.  Nothing special, bit definitely worth the trip (and probably wait) for the pie.."
"I loved this place.  We went last night and the pizza and service were outstanding.  I'd like to give a particular shout out to the management, who, upon hearing that I (like an idiot) dropped my phone behind the booth, came out to help me at the end of our meal by deconstructing the booth and using a broom handle to Macgyver my phone from its hiding place.  I was mortified, but the staff was so kind and patient and never made me feel bad.  Also, though I offered an extra tip for their help, the manager refused to take it.  The willingness of Pequad's to go above and beyond the call of duty has earned them my lifelong loyalty."
"OMG.... Go late so you don't have to deal with as crazy of a wait. We stopped in around 11PM; and still had to wait. When the place was pretty empty. *scratches head* that didn't make sense... and the hostess had all sorts of weird excuses about why we had to wait.Anyway... we got the bbq chicken wings with ranch and an order of their to die for pizza.Absolutely. Amazeballs. Usually with deep dish pizza, the first slice has the perfect balance of crunchy outside crust, with fluffy insides, balanced with tomato sauce and toppings and gooey cheese. Second slice is usually soggy and not so fantastic. Pequods still kept its texture and crunch when I tackled the second slice! That is something that's never happened before.... This whole in the wall looking restaurant that's not located in downtown Chicago had the best deep dish pizza I've ever had.Definite must for any trip to Chicago!"
"I like it, it's unique, beats all the other deep dish in town but the flavor does get boring after awhile and it's really expensive to add toppings"
"LOVE.  Different style than other Chicago pizza, so expect different but carmelized cheese on crust can't be beat."
"Incredible deep-dish. My friend was visiting and had never been to Chicago, so this was a great introduction into Chicago style pizza. We loved the sausage and the consistency, I would definitely order the pizza again--but only for take-out. We had been warned about the wait which was crazy, but the sheer noise from inside the bar when we went in to pick up the pizza was overwhelming. There is no way that you could eat or have a conversation comfortably--take out all the way!"
"Any time we have family/friends visiting from out of town, this is where we get their deep dish fix! Expect to wait to get in (a few spots around you can hang out at) and it takes about 45 minutes to cook the pizza. This is not bad service, it's typical so just be prepared. Their appetizers are really good --- the cheesy bread is super delicious. The place is nothing fancy but is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Their crust is what makes it!"
"Whoever said real Chicagoans don't eat deep dish is a liar. Pequod's is my go-to at least once a month. That caramelized crust is what dreams are made of. I recommend getting your pie with extra sauce, as I find the leftovers are better that way."
Great pizza!! Service was really good! Definetly will be craving the deep dish very soon!
"If Jesus Christ himself were resurrected in these times, his first stop would be here for the Pizza."
"This is my favorite deep dish spot in the city- bar none. Plus, I love that it's located right next to the Webster theatre- makes for the perfect post movie lunch or dinner. I usually stick with the classic pepperoni, but sometimes will opt for sausage, green peppers and onions. The later can be a bit messy with all the toppings but it's always delicious none the less."
"Great pizza! I take all my out of town guests here when the visit. Its a laid-back bar atmosphere, not too loud, and always busy."
"I only make it to Chicago every couple years and try to find a new pizza spot each time.  This is easily my new favorite place.  Pizza takes a little while to cook but they tell you this and it's expected.  Prices are easily worth inline and I recommend doing their online ""call ahead"".  The cheese that melts and chars around the edges really makes it!"
"I had the pleasure of trying this joint not too long ago, and it was pretty good. We ended up going around dinner time on a Saturday and yikes...the wait was three hours for a dinner table! However, to get your pizza-to-go it was only an hour and so we settled. Our pizza was topped with spinach, garlic, and Italian sausage (those three go great together). The crust was something different from what I'm used to, it wasn't bad but I don't know if I absolutely loved it. I'd definitely return on a less busy evening to review on service, but I definitely think you should give it a try!"
"Best Pizza in Chicago. Go to: mushrooms and meatballs Deep Dish (meatballs are super underrated there, but really good)."
Favorite pizza anytime I come to Chicago. Hands down what Chicago deep dish is made famous for
By far one of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago! I love that you can add lots of different toppings and that it's not too doughy. It's a must for all tourists visiting Chicago!
Awesome lunch special. One of the best in the  city. And the pizza is excellent. Does get packed. How can you beat that price though?
"So on my road trip to Notre Dame I had to sample Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I have tried several and if I rate those a four I have to rate this place a 5!!!!  Secret to going to these top pizza places is to go on off times and early. This place luckily takes reservations but it is small inside and a tavern feel vs other places that are true restaurants. We sampled the thin crust (which in my mind is still thicker than most pizza) and the traditional Deep Dish. If I were to come back again and I will it is deep dish hands down. The crust and sauce are melting with flavors all around. This place is truly amazing. Again small place, tavern feel but of course kids are allowed.  Also if you are stopping by before a Cubs game and score parking Uber or Lyft to game."
"Hands down, unequivocally the best deep dish pizza period. There is no equal, I have eaten and eat a lot of pizza and nothing on this planet compares to a Pequod's pepperoni deep dish pizza. The caramelized cheese is amazing!!! Fun to eat inside, the place has character. You may wait a bit for your freshly made, delicious caramelized crust pizza, but it is worth every second. Great tasting bubbly fountain soda awaits to refresh your palate."
"His place has the best pizza in Chicago hands down. What makes this place different is the way they make pizza. The sauce is amazing and full of favor. They caramelize cheese on the crust which captures the flavors amazingly. I have ate pizza from several locations and I have yet to find something as good as this location. Some advice:1. If you are coming on Friday or Saturday night, you will have to wait up to an hour to get in. This may seem like a long time, but there is a reason people wait. You can call ahead and have priority seating, which can shorten your wait. 2. My personal opinion, the more ingredients you place on the pizza the soggier it will get. Less in this case is more. 3. If there are any major Chicago sporting events, it will be packed. 4. Parking is rough at times. Drive on the street behind, there are more chances of finding parking there."
"This is my favorite pizza in Chicago, hands-down.  It is light and fresh, without the greasy crust most chains have.  I also love the atmosphere; it is very casual and friendly.  It does have long wait times, but it's worth the wait!"
"Man, this place is kick ass. It has a real, local feel from the exposed brick walls to the staff and people inside. Nothing fancy or hip bit feels like a place where real deep dish pizza is made the same way they've been doing for decades (could be wrong). The service was really great. Not overly attentive or anything but a casual sense about it. Three guys total, after a night out, we split a medium deep dish with Canadian bacon, pepperoni, spinach and sausage. 6 slices total and 2 slices each and the waitress was absolutely correct-totally enough. Proved us wrong when we thought of doing two pizza pies. The pizza was absolutely savory and delicious. Thick and heavy with a crunchy harder exterior and a chewy soft doughy bread on the inside and amazing toppings. Not the kind you grab with your hand and bite in 3 goes. Definitely a knife and fork sitch. Also, great value for the yums - $30 for a medium with five toppings. Left very satisfied."
New favorite pizza place in the city! Although the wait times can be lengthy around lunch time the wait is completely worth it! The lunch special is a wonderful deal and pequods offers a nice selection of drinks and desserts. The only downsides I can think of the is the long wait time for the food (pan pizza takes a long time to make) and the low light. Will be back soon whenever I'm in Lincoln park!
"Absolute best pizza in Chicago!!  The caramelized crust proves that mistakes can yield amazing things - it's what sets their pizza apart from all the competition here!  And it's definitely worth the wait (to sit down b/c they're always busy, and for the pizza itself!).  :-D"
"I hate deep dish. I don't care for it. I don't like all the cheese, the sauce, and the bread. BUT, Pequod's is THE ONLY place I will eat deep dish at. They do it the best!TIP: If you're going on a Saturday night, make sure you get there early, we got there around 5:30pm and we still waited about 20-30 minutes for a table. The environment is loud and busy, so if you wanted a ""romantic quiet sit down,"" this is not the place for you. Anyways, the pizza is made fresh and will take about 40+ minutes until you get it, but I must say IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. I shared a small with another person, and it was enough since I personally don't eat much. I had 1.5 slices and I was quite full. Their service is amazing as well, our waitress was super nice and attentive even though it was so busy inside. LOVE LOVE LOVE Pequod's. BEST deep dish in the city, hands down!"
"Best deep dish in the city. Hands down phenomenal and amazing. The crust, the thickness and the sausage are everything. I'm a tough critic when it comes to pizza but this is thee best deep dish I've ever had. The only deep dish I eat and forever the undefeated deep dish champ. So much yes"
"Winter is coming, and what better way to prepare for hibernation with a delectable dairy dish! The deep dish pizzas are worth the wait at this hole in the wall sports bar in Oldtown Chicago.These heaping mounds of sauce, cheese, and your choice of toppings are definitely not what the Italians envisioned when they invented the first pizza. Order your choice of a small, medium, or large platter either to share or devour yourself. But beware, this decadent dish packs a punch. I've seen many a ill-fated customer loosen 1 or 2 belt buckles after trying to conquer these savory behemoths.What I recommend you to do is gather 2 of your most lactose tolerant friends, order yourselves a medium deep dish with sausage, green peppers, and of course, Pequods own freshly grown Chicago basil and prepare for a scrumptious dish."
"Excellent deep dish, a bit like Lou's but cheesier and the cheese is carmelized on the sides of the pizza. Great first impression!"
This is my absolute favorite pizza joint in Chicago. They use only the best ingredients. I love the bread and caramelized crust. The sausage is the best. The sauce is outstanding. Just the right amount of everything. Be sure to order just enough to get full and take some home for lunch the next day.
"In a nutshell: Chicago deep dish in Wicker Park.Came here with family, as it was highly recommended and we were driving through the area. Pequod's is located caddy corner to a fairly new shopping center, with a movie theatre, Barnes and Nobles, etc.Parking 3/5Fairly easy. Found street parking a couple blocks down. There is lot parking across the street, but we didn't want to have to pay.Ambience 3/5The place essentially looks like a long sports bar (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…). Bar on the left as you walk in, and most or all of the tables are stool height. Restrooms are in the back across from the kitchen and are pretty clean for a sports bar.Service 4.5/5Actually really good. This earned them the fourth star for me. Our server was really nice, and checked in with us pretty regularly. There was a mix up with our order (I'll get to that later), but she fixed it by giving us half off our food bill. She didn't have too, but the fact that she did was pretty awesome of her.Wait time 1/5Seating - BWaited about 20 minutes for seats. Not badDrinks - AOrdered a pitcher of 312 of the menu (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…) and this came out quick.Food - FExpect to wait longer for deep dish, but this time there was a mix up with our order. The tables around us all got their food before us. We ended up not getting our food for almost an hour and a half. By the time it showed up we were hungry and grumpy. However, we were not as grumpy as we could have been, as the server told us beforehand that she would take half off the price of food for us.Food 4/5Jalapeno poppers - 3/5They didn't suck and they tied us over.....kind of.Large Pepperoni Sausage and Onion (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…) - ABomb. Very comparable to Lou Malnati's. I'm a huge fan of deep dish, since I don't eat it very often. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni in general (shame on me), but everyone else wanted it.Small Sausage Mushroom and Basil (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…) - A-Very tasty but the crust was a bit burnt. Not enough to make it a crappy meal, but then again we had been waiting for over an hour for this. Overall 4/5Food was good, and the service staff did an amazing job trying to make us happy despite of the mix up in the kitchen. Sometimes $h!t happens, but it's all about how they react to it that sets them above other restaurants. Happy with the experience, and I would definitely come back here."
One of my favorite places for pizza. Deep dish. Thin. You name it. It's freakin' delicious.Whenever someone is new to Chicago and asks what place is good for pizza. Say Pequod's.I love the buttery crust.. the edges are nicely caramelized and crispy..The wonderful cheese to sauce to topping to dough ratio is just right.Their selection of craft beer is great to go with your hearty pizza too.It's Hawks season so when you go here on a weeknight expect it to be busy.I love this place. It's always satisfying.
"Bar none best pizza in Chicago! The Skokie location is cash only, but so worth the hassle!"
"What a fun and lively place to go out to eat for some classic Chicago style zaaa!I arrived with a group of 4 on a Tuesday night. Pequod's was busy (as to be expected). We were able to get our first round of drinks from the bar while we waited to be seated. I was very content with the speed of the service from the bartender.Once we were seated, the waitress greeted us promptly and helped us with the menu a bit. She was quick and efficient. Over all the service was immaculate for how busy the restaurant was. Well done. Now on to the food.We ordered bruschetta, wings, and a 12"" traditional style pizza with spinach, onion, green pepper and onion. The bruschetta was buttery and light. The wings had a killer buffalo sauce that I would like to purchase to my own use at home. The deep dish pizza was to die for. The crust was super crispy but the dough and cheese in the middle was warm and gooey. Perfect for a cold winter night. Something about their recipe just screams true Chicago deep dish. I would recommend this place to anyone who's got a craving or wants to show some out of towners how Chicago does pizza."
"The lunch special available on weekdays -- $5 cheese pizza with choice of pop -- is the best. I visited Pequod's with a family member and we weren't disappointed. Friendly wait service. You may have to wait for it to cook, but it's worth it."
"One of the best pizzas of my life.  It's like a Ferrari of pizzas.  You can tell that they put in a lot of work and amazing ingredients to perfect their recipe.But to cover the whole experience.  This place is awesome.  It has two bars.  One upstairs and one downstairs along with seating for eating in both.  It is like a dive bar, that happens to serve some of the best pizza in the world.  Let's just say if I lived within walking distance, I would be here far too often! :)Drinks were good too.  They have blue moon on tap and make cocktails.  Oh, and the sausage pizza is what we had and it is a must because I think they make their own sausage because it was mike mama's meat balls on there.If you live in Chicago or within 50 miles of this place and haven't tried it then you are missing out.  There is a reason why it was voted top 10 pizzas in America."
"My favorite pizza place of all time! You can't get a better Chicago style deep dish pizza anywhere! The crust is perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The place is always jammed pack, and I wonder why..!!! The service is delightful. It takes about an hour to cook these bad boys, so make sure to order before you get to the restaurant. They need to expand this place to the suburbs so I can eat here more frequently! Love my za!"
"This is some great Chicago deep-dish pizza. The choice of toppings is fantastic, and the portion sizes very generous for a great price. We were a group of six in for some lunchtime pizza, and I was amazed at the amount of food we got in two pizzas. We couldn't finish everything, but taking away was no problem.The place is fairly small and very busy, so we did have to queue for some time outside, but it was worth the wait. Just keep this in mind if you're planning to visit, especially in a large group."
"If you're ever craving some pizza-topped bread, this is the place to go! I mean that in the best way possible though, because man on man, that crust! Like other reviewers have said, this deep dish is a THICK layer of crust topped with some sauce, gooey cheese, and your choice of toppings. The texture is really great, though I think either the crust or sauce could have done with a bit more flavor. This is my second favorite deep dish in Chicago so far, and next time I'm down for some carb overload, I'll return!"
"Amazing food! Amazing service! Always my go to stop for pizza! Can't go wrong here, listen it takes a while but well worth it! This place is literally the bomb"
"I have never dined in, and can only speak for delivery. But if delivery pizza is this good then I can only assume it's the same as dining in. I absolutely love their deep dish! The crust and bread is ridiculously buttery and worth the calories. I like to get the deep dish with pepperoni, with green and red peppers. Tell them to make the pizza well done- gives it that extra crisp!"
"Pizza is fantastic, and it's something I crave now. Best deep dish I've had so far. Like others say, the waits are something to consider, but we often do delivery anyway. The caramelized cheese is just so perfect - a bit crispy and a bit chewy and just fantastic flavor. Love the pizza. Delicious."
"Forever and always my favorite pizza in Chicago. I take everyone who comes from out-of-town to Peaqods. I've been to a child's birthday party in the space upstairs and it was amazing. Arrive before you get too hungry, cause the pizzas take a while to cook, but it's so worth the wait. Enjoy!"
"Ok so the way I explain this pizza is think of Beggars thick thin crust, but with seriously the best quality ingredients on the planet and cooked to a cheesy, crispy, crunchy state of perfection. The ingredients and the way they are cooked just make this pizza a new player. And it's fair to say it's the best thin crust, as it's totally different from deep dish. You have to try it."
My favorite location for Chicago style pizza. Whenever I have out of towners this spot is always on my list of recommendations. The long wait is definitely worth it.
"I'm a Chicago native so you can bet I have tried just about all of the Chicago Deep Dish pizza's out there. This is definitely my favorite of them all!I have been coming here since the bar next door used to Flounders (currently called the Drinking Bird I believe?). When it was Flounders, the owners would let us bring the tasty goodness of their neighbor (if their kitchen was already closed) after drinking shenanigins with close friends. Which of course always tasted like heaven.Whether or not I have had an adult beverage or not, this my favorite of all deep dish pizza's. The caramelized crust is just mouth watering. The care they put into the ingredients and the customer service is apparent every time you come here!Funny story, the first time I brought my best friend and her husband to Pequods, he was like why's the crust burnt?! I said no, not burnt it's caramelized. Now when he was in Afghanistan he would tell her how much he missed his ""burnt crust from Pequods!"" I may not go into the restaurant very often, but I'm sure glad they deliver. You can't go wrong with what I refer to as ""The Chicagoan Deep Dish"" - because we all know that Giordano's (while tasty as well in its own right) is the tourist attraction."
"I hate to leave a glowing review, because I'd like tourists to continue thinking Giordano's and Lou Malnati's are the deep dish gold standard. However, it's the best deep dish in the city, making it the best deep dish the United States. The wait can be long, yes, but with plenty of seating and a beer or two to pass the time, it's worth the wait."
"Let the debate begin!  I had the deep dish with sausage because that's one of my favorites at Lou Malnati's which is at the top of my list.  I heard about Pequod's famous crust, and I have to say I did enjoy it.  There is definitely more crust to the pizza than other deep dish joints.  For example, Giordano's has got the thick layer of cheese making up most of their slice.  Malnati's has equal amount of cheese and sauce.  At Pequod's, it's crust.Don't get me wrong, there's sauce and cheese but not as much as the other places, so know that going into it.  Now the sauce was great.  Right up there with Malnati's.  At Giordano's the sauce has this kind of burnt/baked on feel to it which is still good.  The sauce here was very tomatoey like Malnati's and tasted fresh.  Now for the sausage.  It tasted great and I just wanted more.  Maybe it's because it was a personal sized pizza.Overall, really enjoyed it.  It was one I hadn't tried after living in Chicago for so long, and I'm glad I tried it.  However, it's behind Lou Malnati's and Giordano's for me."
"Very good Chicago dish deep! The only issue I have is the pizza isn't the same if you order for pick up or take your leftovers home and eat it the next day.... It must be eaten straight out of the oven in the pan. If you do happen to have leftovers reheat in a cast iron pan, you'll enjoy it much more then in the microwave or oven."
Best Chicago style pizza in the city; the place you actually order from regularly as a Chicagoan.Pan - sausage and pepperoniAte there in person recently; ate upstairs and it was a fun change!
Best deep dish in Chicago! The crust in thinner. You tell yourself one slice but always eat 2 because it just melts in your mouth and isn't too heavy for a deep dish. Great for eating in or take out. Free parking on the side streets too!
"Pequod's pizza is cheesy goodness. Thin crust or pan pizza, you really can't go wrong at Pequod's. Bonus: get the mozzarella sticks. For some reason, I think they're better here than anywhere else in the city."
"Unquestionably the best pizza in Chicago.  Yeah, you may have to wait a bit, but it's soooooo worth it. So sad that I moved away to the southern burbs and can't get it as often.  They are magical!!!"
Delicious everything and a kind staff that didn't mind this professor sitting and grading papers on a packed Saturday. Great service when your stomach us gnawing at your backbone. The staff did alot of kiddy flirting back and forth management may wish to address this so the staff is paying attention solely to clients as opposed to each other
"WORTH THE WAIT!I'm pretty sure i visited Chicago about three or four times before finally getting a taste of a deep dish pizza. To my delight, my boyfriend's family knew exactly where to go!If you're going to go here on a weekend (which we did), be prepared to wait for and hour or two depending on the time you get there. Luckily, there are a lot of bars and other areas you can chill and have drink while you're waiting for them to buzz you (just make sure your buzzer is still within their radius)We waited about two hours until we were finally seated. They actually have a lot of space in their building. Our table was on the second floor which i preferred more. Plus! if you go to the bathroom, they have a lord of the rings wall decor- at least the women's bathroom did...i didn't check the men's haha ANYWAY, as for the food. we ordered drinks and the Pequod's salad, which was a great light start considering we were going to carb central with all the pizza. We ordered two medium sized deep dished pizza. There were five of us and each of us ate around two slices and still had leftovers! One pizza has mushrooms, garlic and sausage. The other pizza was a simple pepperoni and cheese, but we asked for anchovies on the side as well. The pizzas itself was amazing! The dough they use is lighter than i expected, almost like focaccia but not as soft. They carmelize the crust which gives a great crunch at the end. As for the toppings, the sausage was delicious but the garlic just made that one pizza. So DO put garlic! The pepperoni and cheese was an awesome classic as well, and the anchovies was a nice touch when you add it. Overall, I was very satisfied and glad I came here for my first ever experience of a Chicago deep dish pizza!"
"Cheese crusted deep dish. Bam. My first ever legit deep dish chicago style pizza in the city of chicago. I can't compare it to any other ""best chicago style pizza"" joints since I didn't have time to check those out but my foodie local friend took us here because, ""once you have cheese crusted deep dish why would you ever go back?""to lighten it up, i got only veggies on mine and it was nothing short of blissful heavenly pizza. my husband had the meat heavy topping and he enjoyed both styles. con: the immensely long wait. we sat down and waited for an eternity (maybe 45 min?) to get our pizza. but, it was also during the nhl play offs so the place was packed (chicago vs la) so perhaps it was just due to overcapacity.great, now i'm dreaming of this place."
"Definitely my favorite pan pizza place in Chicago! I would consider this more a pan pizza, but I can tell how it's a deep dish/pan mix. The crust looks burnt (but doesn't taste like it), and I think it's because of the deep dish pan they use. The crust is flakey and buttery, and holds up the slice just fine. I've always had the pizza cooked to perfection and taste amazing, they definitely don't cheap out on the toppings and load the pizza with what you want.They also have an amazing in-house lunch special. Just make sure you have an hour, because it probably takes minimum 20 minutes to get the pizza out (fresh cooked). I ended up getting pepperoni/jalapeno and it was simply amazing. I believe it's a 7"" personal pizza, so kudos to you if you can finish it off. It comes with a free soda as well, so it's a pretty amazing deal all around.Check this place out if you love pizza and want to experience something different from the traditional thin crust/deep dish."
The best deep dish pizza in Chicago if you get it hot from the oven. Carryout is not as good because the steam from the box causes the crust to get soggy.
"The pizza was good. Service was as well, the waitress was nice. I got the personal pan with pepperoni and it was the perfect amount! I asked for fresh basil after I placed the initial order. The server told me it would make it on the pizza, but it didn't. Other than that, everything went great! I arrived on a Monday at 10:00 pm, so there was no wait for a table. I don't know if I'd ever wait over 30 minutes for a seat like some of the other yelpers have indicated. The dining room/ambiance is nothing special, so I'd just get it to go at that point."
We got the deep dish pepperoni and sausage pizza and it was perfect! We had family in town and wanted to show them the best Chicago pizza and it definitely did not disappoint! Can't wait to come back again!
Amazing deep dish pizza! One can't go to Chicago and not try a deep dish pizza. The toppings are a bit pricey but well worth. The crust was crispy and not at all soggy. I recommend Pequod's to anyone interested in trying Chicago style deep dish pizza.
I think I just had a religious experience at this place and now worship all things with Giardiniera. A literal flavortown in my mouth rn.
Very delicious pizza with generous amount of cheese and perfectly seasoned. They crust is so crunchy and tasty. Absolutely one the bests in town. Only downside long time of service.
"As a native South Sider we all have our pizza shop loyalties, but every so often you have to stray and find out if all he talk is just that or if you've found another place to add to the rotation.I'll start by telling you this place gets packed and there's almost no way around it, be prepared to get drinks at the bar and average an hour plus wait during peak times, also if you're not aware pan pizza will take anywhere from 45-130 depending on how busy it is, factor that into your plans.Now for the pizza, it was amazing, ordered sausage, pep, and peppers with extra sauce. Caramelized crust was spot on, cooked perfectly and dos not disappoint in any factor, crust, cheese or toppings. With a great tap list of craft and many TVs for the games it will be added to my list of highly rated Chicago pizza joints."
"We got there right before dinner rush so we sat right down, pretty decent wait it appeared to be if you're not early!!! Food was great, we had a deep dish and thin crust pizza with salads.  Pizzas take about 40 minutes so don't come on starving, order a salad and wait!! It will be worth it! Servers are slammed but take good care of you."
Best pizza in Chicago .. Hello run here dont walk this is a must for every foodie ..
Favorite pizza! Even chose this as my meal after finishing the marathon. Go for the deep dish with sausage.
"I bring my family and friends visiting Chicago to this famous hot spot for some genuine deep dish. Sitting at the bar is my favorite spot, but be aware of the amount of take out people order."
"I love this place. This is my go to when out-of-town visitors want to truly experience Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza here is way better than Lou Malnati's and Giodano's. Worth coming out here and waiting in line in order to get your fix of delicious pizza. I usually go with basil, mushroom, and sausage, and I would highly recommend that combination. You will need a medium to feed about 3 people (each get 2 slices) - and trust me, you will be plenty full. Note this is deep dish, I have not given their thin crust a try. I've converted so many people to Pequod's. It the true local Chicago deep dish pizza experience. My only complaint and the only thing that's holding Pequod's from getting a five star rating is the fact that the quality sadly is not consistent. There will be times when Pequod's completely knock the ball out of the park and give you an amazing pizza, but there are also other times when the crust is burnt or not fully cooked. They don't take real reservations - you can call ahead but what happens is that you get to jump to the top of list, which will still require some wait (unlike most other restaurants, where you will have a table ready as soon as you walk in). I have ordered for pick-up in the past (it took about 50 minutes), but the pizza experience is not the same. That same day, delivery was about 2 hours. So I would plan ahead if you would like to order a pizza and eat from your home. I would say to truly experience Pequods, you have to eat the pizza there. When it pops right out of the oven, it is amazing. The long wait is crazy. I have waited 2+ hours in the past. There is a Barnes and Nobles nearby and that's where I go to hang out while waiting. It's worth it and just do it!"
"Great experience, great pizza, great value! I had heard this was the place to go and it was. Nice, cozy, local neighborhood joint with friendly staff, totally took care of me and made me me feel welcome. The name is pronounced Pea-Quad and that's the name of the Chef from the book Moby Dick. They also have a bar next door called Whales Tales where patrons can go and enjoy a few drinks while waiting to get in, think you might even get a discount if they know you're waiting to get in for pizza. The lunch special was 4.95 for a seven inch pan pizza and a drink, for this quality that's insane! Really, perhaps the best pan pizza I've ever had and it was a thing of beauty to eat and look at. Such perfect sauce, caramelized cheese and pepperoni. I also had a very good appetizer of garlic sticks and marinara. My total bill was maybe 10.65 or so. I was worried about long lines, so I got there rift when they opened at 11am on a Wednesday morning and there were only two ahead of me. If anyone ever asks me where I think the best pizza in Chicago is, this is the place I'll send them!"
"BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO! Ok, that's all the yelling I'll do, but yes, just so you get this straight, you can't beat Pequods, it is the absolute best! If you want to have the warranty of getting seated, you have 2 options:1- get there before 6 on a week day2-  call ahead and he put in their list 24 hours before you want to dine  [they don't have reservations, but if you do this they cut your waiting time by half once you get there]If you like pepperoni pizza, go for it, they sprinkle that one with magical rainbow powder that really pairs very well with the cheese caramelization that happens on the cheese at the edge of all the crust.Service has always been great every time we went, and they have a good arrange of local brews.Please tourist, skip Giordanos, come here to get the real deal!"
"The pizza is totally worth the wait (even if you call in a ""reservation"" you are only given priority so may wait, especially if a bigger party).  That crust...people were not lying.  And actually their Pequod salad is pretty good and so is their vegable soup!"
"So many pizza choices in Chicago, and I'm sure there are a dozen good ones.  Pequods is unique for two reasons.  First off this location is more of a local hangout than a tourist spot, and there are $5.75 lunch deals to be had via Yelp for a pizza and a drink.  Secondly, their deep dish pizza is baked with some cheese on outside edge of crust so that it caramelizes into a semi-burnt dreamy nirvana of crisp cheese heaven.  A personal size is almost too much, especially when you add on a $2.50 salad.  Overall the best value for our dollar on our trip, and a casual, local hangout type atmosphere.  Would definitely recommend anybody visiting Chicago make the short Uber/Lyft trip up to north side to eat here."
"Pequod's is, by far, my favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago. Now...I know that this is a rather sensitive topic...given there are some hard-core Giordano's and Lou's supporters out here. But let me just say, I'm reviewing from the point of view of an ""outsider"" (Cali-girl) and that I actually prefer thin crust over deep dish. But I've come to really be able to appreciate a good deep dish pizza, and Pequod's is where it's at! I particularly love the carmelized crispy crust. My fav.If you're not sure, just try it for yourself and do the taste test. Either way, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it, if not completely agree with me that it's the best out of the main deep dish places here in Chi-town."
By far the best pizza in the city. They have accommodated big groups for me when needed. It can be a wait and even for pick up so be strategic when going or just know you are going to wait. They have an amazing lunch deal that I highly recommend. Whenever I have people come to Chicago that have never been we ALWAYS go here.
"Good service, great pizza. Friendly staff, would definitely come back again. Parking can be a little complicated."
"Love this place. Very Chicago. It is difficult to park yet it is worth it. Great pizza, great staff."
I had my FIRST Chicago deep dish pizza here after my Chicago-resident friend had recommended it. The staff was friendly and accommodating to our large party. We ordered several pies and tried them with different types of toppings. Everything was delicious and I finally gained some insight into people's love for deep dish pizza.
Would have gotten a 5 star if the cheese bread was better.  Great service. AMAZING CHEESY CRUST! Get extra sauce.  It has really fresh tasting tomatoes.
I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this place! One of the first places I checked out in Chicago for deep dish and I've now tried Gino's East and Lou Malnati's. I prefer this one because of the crust and the delicious toppings and sauce. I really enjoyed the caramelized crust with its yummy crunchiness. The sauce is also delicious and there is a good balance between dough and toppings/sauce. Some places have tooo much dough or too much sauce. I liked it here because it didn't feel like either was overwhelming. Pizza takes about 45 minutes to bake so be ready for that. We ordered appetizers which were just alright (chicken strips) but were delivered so speedily. Come here for the pizza!
"I was only in Chicago for a day and wanted the best pizza in the whole city and I got what I wanted. They caramelize their crust and I read that they're the only people to do so. The pizza looks like it would be super heavy but surprisingly it was not. The sauce has really good flavor and the personal was definitely a good size to share if you want to continue eating at multiple places for the rest of the day. The cost of the pizza was really cheap too. The sausage was bigger than what I'm used to, they appear to be more like meatballs instead. Atmosphere was solid, they played good music but that's just my opinion."
Well worth the hour wait to get seated and 40 minutes for the deep dish pie to be baked. Loved loved loved. Told GM when he stopped by the table that he must open in Milwaukee. I'll be there daily. Mmmm.
"Get involved, that's about all that I need to say about this place!  I had heard for weeks how great their pizza was.  I was told it was a deep dish sort of a dough, bread, sauce, garlic, seasoning, creation.  Umm, count me in!I went on a Friday night, carry out.  I came home, devoured basically the whole large pizza, felt imeediately ill because I ate too much, and wanted to eat more 7-minutes later.  I loved it!I think in person would be better, but overall I need more of Pequods in my life."
Hands down one of my favorite pizza spots in Chicago!! The caramelized crust is life!!! Staff is friendly as well although it can get packed on busier days!
"It was my first visit to Chicago and my first time trying deep dish pizza. My bf had tried the big name deep dish pizza places so I suggested we try Pequods, a place he hadn't been before. Waiting for the pizza felt like forever because we were both so hungry we didn't have the energy to talk about anything except when the food would be out. Luckily we had came before the rush so it only took about 15-20 minutes which is standard btw. The pizza was amazing. They cook the crust with cheese so it's like a crispy cheese crust. Just imagine when you melt cheese in a frying pan and it turns that golden brown. Imagine a piece of that on the crust. Every bite is just the right amount of oozing cheese, pepperoni, sauce and crust. To make it better, the pizza wasn't as oily as some pizzas can be so you don't even feel guilty as you eat your second slice of deep dish and eye your third slice. :) My bf and I shared a small which was more than enough."
"Amazing! Worth the wait for sure, not to mention you can go to the bar next door and have a drink while you are waiting.  This is the best Chicago has to offer no doubt. The Pep/sausage was to die for!  I can't wait to visit again."
"It was time to try a new pizza place.  Previously a Lou Malnati's and Jet's Pizza only fan, but the last two carry-out experiences at both left me ready to explore other options.Pequod's product performed perfectly.  Totally worth the 1+ hour carry out time.  Totally worth waiting in the pickup line in the restaurant which was packed like the Red Line at rush hour.The pan pizza (their deep dish) was cooked perfectly, with the cheese just crisped just the way I like it around the edges.  The dough was appropriately cooked-through and crispy on the bottom, and offset by the heavenly layer of softness where it met the balanced sauce and toppings.  Ohh, the sauce.  Not too pasty, not too watery, with just the level saltiness and seasoning.  As with most pizza experiences, the sauce made the pizza.  Got my money's worth of toppings.  Cheese layer was thankfully just the right thickness.  The only thing I'd change would be to add the fresh basil later in the cooking process so that it didn't get so crispy too.Totally their own pizza recipe, but I might compare a little to the bumpiness, crispiness, and interest of NYC's Prince Street Pizza, and the dough recipe of Detroit's Pizza Papalis.Absolutely will be returning."
I had heard so many great things about this place and was super excited to try it. I had the deep dish pizza with mushroom and spinach and it was so delicious! We got the fries for an appetizer (the pizza takes about 45 minutes to make) and they were perfectly cooked and crunchy! The staff was super nice and friendly. Can't wait to go back!
"Best deep dish pizza CRUST, by far. I'm a huge fan of the extra crispy crust with some burnt bits of cheese - I practically finish it before I've even worked on the pizza itself. So freaking delicious.Long, long lines, but definitely worth it. I've waited 2 hours on a Sunday night, and even in my hangry state, could not be unhappy with Pequods. You can call in to theoretically ""shorten"" your wait time, but when I called and later arrived, they just put my name down underneath everyone else... after confirming with me ""Ah you called, we'll let you know."" I'm doubtful of this system.NOTABLE:-Their lunch special is pretty ridiculous - I think it's like $5! - so hop on that if you can.-This one may be obvious but do not order the Pequod's Salad. One, who goes to a deep dish pizza place to order a salad? Two... It's lettuce with pizza toppings."
"Ok...if I could eat here everyday I would.  Amazzzzing pizza. Best crust ever.  And if you don't believe my review just ask the thousand people that are there, every-time & anytime you try to go (that would be my only complaint). Seriously even at lunch, during the week this place is packed & it's huge.  But major bonus points to them for buying the bar next doors, so you can have a drink while you wait for a table.  I like their style of thinking."
"Pequod's is in just the right location. It's near the Regal Cinema and other great businesses in the Chicago area. The pans they cook the pizza in caramelize the cheese and you'll find yourself abandoning your table manners and picking and pulling the ingredients off and nibbling ferociously. The items are cooked to order so it'll be at least 30 minutes for some hot and delicious memories. The staff are very nice and will try to seat you upstairs or downstairs based on your preference. Be forewarned, during peak times there can be a wait since many patrons will wait for a movie to start or watch sports as they dine. Parking is located in a nearby garage as street parking is a rarity."
"Really great pizza and they give you huge portions. I especially like the crunch texture of the crust. The wait time is a little long for their signature pan pizza, approximately 45 minutes, but it's worth it! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. In fact, when we had some left over and wanted to go watch a movie across the street, they let us keep our pizza in their fridge till we were done with the movie. This is definitely a place I'd go to again if I'm in town. Fully recommended!"
"Heard of this place from coworkers, and I was interested in the carmelized cheese lining the crust. SO good - the pan pizzas take ~ 40min to come out, but the wait was clearly communicated and there are a lot of appetizers to choose from while you wait. The deep dish slices were surprisingly light and easy to eat. The sauce was really fresh, too. Wonderful experience!"
"This is hands down my favorite pizza restaurant in the city. I am so addicted to their handtoss, caramelized crust pizza. The wait to get a seating is something I'm not a fan of but that's the price I have to pay for getting the best pizza in the city."
Pequod's is the best of the best when it comes to Chicago style pizza! The toppings always taste super fresh. I only had to knock off a star because sometimes the hostesses and wait staff can seem really disinterested. But it's definitely nothing that would ever stop me from eating in or ordering delivery.
"Have gone many times for dinner, but that lunch special is amazing! $4.95 for a personal size cheese pan pizza (toppings extra) and soda.  It's definitely the best pan pizza in the city (I don't consider it deep dish, like Lou's or Giordano's)"
"I came here after doing a little shopping in the area, and was pleasantly surprised. I have heard a lot of good things about this place, and the pizza exceeded all my expectations. Very highly recommended, I wish there was a Pequods near me!"
"Come during the weekday for their lunch special!!! Such a deal!!! 7"" Pan Cheese Pizza and a fountain soda for $4.95 and each toppings for 80 cents more! It was so good!!! I'm not a big fan of pizza in general and I had deep dish before in California... but this was surprisingly good and you can't beat their lunch deal! Thanks for the great experience! They do not take reservations, but you can call ahead of time for them to put your name down and when you arrive, you will be moved up to the top of the waiting list! Seating is not guaranteed however!"
"Really, a forty minute wait to sit down for pizza?  Must be some really good pizza.And the eight of us waited outside, in the cold winter.  Argh.  Everyone insisted on waiting.  Fine.  We are all already there.Lemme tell you something.  This place is a grower, not a shower.  We walked through a lot, to get seated on the top floor, at the very back.  Took us bears and pandas maybe ten or fifteen minutes to get through it all.The waitress?  Got our complicated order just right.  She totally earned that $60 tip. How was the pizza, you ask?  Some of our group came from New York.  They were inspired to start a business based on the pizza they had here. Idk how feasible it would be to order from here and then deliver it to Manhattan or Brooklyn, and have it piping hot.I'm still in the group that says ""Its just pizza, and no, if you think it's better than sex...you're not doing IT right.""A suggestion for better business and flow:Give a menu to people waiting outside.  Especially during winter. You can even have them/us order and pay while outside.  We will do it.  Why?  Because we are already hungry.  And you'll have faster table turnover, so you can seat even more people in a night.And it gives us a reason not to leave before we even get to enter."
"Went here because we wanted a late dinner after visiting the Art Institute one evening. My spouse has tried most of the other famous Chicago-style pizza places in the area. The pizza was delicious--good crust, though the cheese and sausage toppings were not well distributed. We enjoyed the meal, but spouse says it's not his favorite in the area. We called ahead and they said 30 min wait, but we were seated immediately."
"Pizza is fantastic and always rated very highly in any post you'll see about the best Chicago pizza. ALWAYS call ahead/make a reservation - This will move you up on the list when you arrive, but you will still probably have about an hour wait.IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. You'll even have to wait for the pizza (deep dish), but trust me, it's worth it."
"Unbelievable chicago pie! Asanty, I feel sorry for you. The fact that you would even consider Domino's as actual pizza. Your comments should be stricken from the records."
"Great pizza!  Love the crust, sauce and everything in between!  Delicious!  Great vibe and fun place to hang out in a group or your significant other :-)"
"First off, any place that features a sperm whale with panties on his head maniacally riding a bike of some sort hawg is my kind of place. So after a $25 can ride,  I walk in the door and it's a neighborhood pizza place. Local all the way. Waitresses and hostess are polite, but not kissing your butt like you're some tourist. Beers are straight-forward. A few local selections, and the usual mass market stuff.So on to the pies: order thin or pan crust, toppings are extra, and there are lots of them.We got two pan pies: 1. Pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, fresh garlic awesomeness.2. Olives, and a bunch of other veggies for the vegetaters. After a few beers, while waiting for the pies:I watched chick ice skating on the Olympics. Gotta love that chick ice skating...The pizza: THICK crust. Burnt black at the top edges from the cast iron pan. HUGE toppings, like sausage the size of a half-dollar. Pepperoni? Yup it's on there, a lot of it. Every now and then, a sharp bit of garlic, and plenty of mushrooms goodness. Crisp bottom to the crust, but light interior. Quite a bit of dough. A lot of places do that thing where the toppings are in the middle and topped with sauce. Not here, it's definitely a pan pizza with the goodness on top.In short: This is one badass pie. I need a nap. A long one. I give it a solid 4.5 stars, and we'll see if they get that last half when I come back for the thinner crust pies."
So good.... I recommend this pizza to new comers to town;) call in your order the place is so popular it's grown past the holding capacity. Local fav!!! Get some pizza after the movie!
"I'm not a Chicagoan.  I don't mind Deep Dish, I love cheese.  But to me, it's more of a casserole type of pizza.  I have tried about 5 different places deep dish here in the city and this one is far and above the best.  The pepperoni is so crispy and there's the yummy slightly crispy cheese parts around the edge.  And the crust isn't super sweet like all the other deep dish places!  That's a big one for me.  I would never wait the 2 hrs for my pizza again.  1 hr outside and then 1 hr at our table.  It was Saturday around 8 so our bad for the timing, but, it is way better to eat there than delivery.  Doesn't hold up well with delivery.  At least up to Lakeview area.  Anyhow, it's delicious.  Highly recommend for ppl that want deep dish but aren't huge deep dish fans.  In my opinion :)"
Great pizza with a great environment too! It seems to always be busy but the wait is never as long as they say!
"I've had Chicago Deep Dish Pizza before. My friend, a Chicago transplant for 10 years, stated this was a secret favorite of the neighborhood.  It is a bit crowded and loud, but that's a good thing, that means the food is good.We were told that it would be a 40-50 minute wait.  We ended up waiting less than 20 minutes.  The pizza takes a while, 40-50 minutes and it actually did take that long.  Bring conversation with you.We ended up getting the Large deep dish with: wait for it... Sausage + Spinach + Garlic!!!It was delicious. OVERALL IMPRESSION:I'd say the pizza is about par compared to other deep dishes I've had. But, it's surely better than the average pizza. I would go back."
"Best deep dish in Chicago. Period. Good, relaxed atmosphere. Great beer selection. Probably only do once every 6 months as an incredibly calorific experience."
"I've had so many deep dish pizzas in Chicago, and Pequod's does it the best. If you love a heavy focus on toppings, a crunchy crust, and less sauce, their pizza wins for sure! While getting a table for dinner on the weekend means waiting 2+ hours, we have found that carry out is the best option since the hole-in-the-wall, crowded atmosphere of the restaurant isn't for us. I prefer this deep dish pizza over the often-favored Giordanos because the crust is much tastier (and not soggy in the middle) and the pizza isn't just all sauce."
"The best deep dish in Chicago!  Love the slices of cheese as the crust.  Hands down, best Chicago deep dish!"
Literally the best Pepperoni Pizza money can buy. An institution! They never let me down at lunch or dinner or party size. Its always been good.
I'm not a fan of deep dish or red sauce but this place is fantastic. Crust is totally unique - crispy and flavorful outside but perfect soft dough inside. Delicious home made pizza sauce seasoned to perfection with excellent consistency. Peppers were full strips of vegtable and we had half Italian beef and half meatball- flavorful! Can't wait to come back - friendly/welcoming staff and clean establishment.
"Pequod's is easily the best pan pizza in Chicago. The edge of the crust looks like burnt lace and tastes crispy, caramelized, and perfect, yet the crust itself is soft and pillowy.  They add a really nice amount of cheese and sauce and are not stingy with toppings.  The sauce has great flavor and a bit of spice!  The pizza is just so dang good - it's tasty, amazing, rich, and perfect.  There's also an awesome lunch special - you can get an individual pan pizza for 5! (Toppings are extra) If I am craving deep dish (though this is more pan than deep dish), this is absolutely where I want to go - if I can handle the two hour wait that usually accompanies dinner here.  I give four stars instead of five because the service is generally poor and slow.  I'm not complaining that the food takes too long to come - it's deep dish, of course it's gonna take an hour (and on busy nights, more than that).  It's that our servers aren't the most attentive and forget things that we ask for.  It happens every time I go."
"I just cruised right in this piece with a friend of mine, and sat down.Our waitress was off the chain, and we definitely dug that.The pizza was so good that I wanted to like marinate in it all day."
"My fiance and went here last night. We are foodies and try a new place every weekend. The places we try range from 5 star to total dives. The pizza is amazing. The pizza is totally cheesy and the crust is the best you can get. We also tried a Pequod salad. The toppings were plentiful and the house made Italian dressing is the best I've had. This place will not disappoint. Ive read some of the other reviews- you dont go to Pequod's for a 5 star atmosphere. You go for the food. If you want a 5 star atmosphere you choose a steak house, etc. This place is perfection and we are thrilled we chose Pequod's for our date night. We went to Distilled for drinks beforehand and also enjoyed ourselves"
This place is always packed... but for a reason! Delicious pizza and they serve alcohol. Just give extra time to wait for a seat especially on a weekend. But once you are seated food comes quick :)
"Want the city's best deep dish? Don't waste your time with the stuffed pizza ""chains"". This place is in a league of its own. Only downfall is that seating can be sparse on the weekends or during dinner rush hours. Great people run this place."
Tasty pizza. Unusual crust makes it worth a look.
"On a recent visit to Chicago we were directed to Pequod's by a local rather than to more popular spots. We were not disappointed, the pizza was delicious and they have a great selection of beer as well."
very nice pan/deep dish pizza.  their sauce and caramelized crust makes it unique.  definitely a must try.  stay away from their thin... its a 2/10... nice beef... lot of other menu items just standard.
"UPDATE: This place got featured on food network as one of AMERICA'S TOP FIVE PIZZA JOINTS! SO IF YOUR EVER IN THE AREA MAKE SURE TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT!!!So everyone knows that Chicago is known for their deep dish pizzas and there is a plethora of pizza joints running amok in Chitown. There's Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, Giordianios, and the list just goes on and on. Everybody has their opinion of what is the best and their favorite. The best pizza joints compete and some really might be better than each other by honestly the difference of what constitutes ""better"" is literally by a thin thread. That's why I was on the hunt for a deep dish pizza that was truly unique and I found it at Pequod's!Their service was horrible and the way hostess and managers run the business just lacked class and professionalism. You can tell they were flabergasted with the crowd of lines waiting to get this pizza. We decided to To GO our pizza and just eat it inside the hotel. No worries! The cheese was still gooey when we opened it.This pizza is truly unique and is baked in a black pan. The inside rim of the pan is sprinkled with mozzarella cheese and that is what makes their infamous caramelized crust. It might not be for everyone because my friend wasn't such a fan. She thought it just tasted burnt. (btw she doesnt really like food that much so her opinion is not valid). I, however, LOVED THE CRUST. It was chewy, salty, and flavorful. I liked the crust so much that when I was too full from my pizza, I took the crust off the other slices and just munched away on the crust."
"I dislike most of the pizza in Chicago. I never seek it out and rarely enjoy it. The style is so, so hard to get right and most places aren't consistent at all. It makes pizza reviews rather ephemeral. Pequod's is my favorite of them all."
"Burnt awesomeness! That burnt looking edge on your deep dish pizza slice? don't cut that off and throw it away. Pequod's secret to an intensely flavored crust is that the pizza masters apply a thin layer of cheese along the sides of the pan. While the resulting flavor is just decent, the texture is ahh-mazing! This caramelization gives a great contrast to the very thick and dense pie. By the time we arrived at Pequod's (after hitting THREE other pizza joints) I was quite full. So, I opted for the spinach version while the bf had the sausage/pepperoni pie. Being that the crust is pretty hefty, some might feel that you need more sauce or more cheese to balance it out, but it was perfect for me since I LOVE carbs. ;-)Located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, it's a locals hangout but you'll spy the occasional tourists (us!) Definitely worth the train or car ride from tourist central Michigan ave. Go to Pequod's -- crispy cheese crust or bust."
"I've grown up eating deep dish, but this was my first time at Pequod's and it was great! I expected a very long wait, but we went on a Sunday around 4:30/5 and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. They have some seating outside while you wait, or you could go next door and get a free soft drink with your buzzer. I had just gotten my drink when the buzzer went off- our wait was only 20 minutes, which was a pleasant surprise. Being deep dish, there was also a wait after you order but the server said ordering just cheese may make the wait shorter. We got some salad and waited less than a half hour for pizza. The sauce was really good, and the crust wasn't as filling as other deep dish spots I've had. Overall, worth it to check out!"
I grew up on pizza from the south side but I can't lie this place was very good. The thin pizza was alright but the pan pizza was delicious. I prefer my pizza well done and it came out just right. Wings were also a hit I really can't complain about this place besides the parking and wait to sit down.
"Pequods....... Love love love your pizza!.The best in the city. Whats up with the service. Our pizza was cold, our bartender she didn't even care. Still love you!"
"4.5 stars, would need to visit more to see if it's 5 stars. Happy that they accept reservations. Really loud (we were seated upstairs). But the pizza, my goodness.sausage and pepperoni deep-dish ($19 for medium 12"") - 4.5 stars. Caramelized cheese crust was f-ing incredible. It looks burnt, but without any of that bitter burnt taste. I approved of the toppings-to-bread ratio (I don't want foccaccio, yo!). Sausage, pepperoni, cheese, sauce, everything was on point. The crust and base had the crisp & softness of a pan pizza.I know in my heart of hearts that I will be back. That is a promise!"
One of my favorite place for deep dish pizza. The crust is to die for. The line to dine in is usually long but worth the wait.
"I love Pequods. But I have a few reasons for not giving 5 stars, even though I want to. I am a vegan so I was DELIGHTED to find that I could eat their deep dish pizza. The crust is one of my favorites and the sauce is so flavorful that it makes me salivate like crazy. That is all I can comment on since I usually just get a completely plain pizza, no cheese. I could add veggies I suppose. The price is okay, deep dish is usually more $$. I wish they offered vegan cheese! Also, be prepared to wait a good 40 minutes or more. It is worth it. OH and there are two levels, it is quite a cosy place."
"Came here for dinner alone (lol) after a TON of people recommended it to me while being in Chicago. Arguably there is a bit of a competition between this + a couple of the other more popular pizza joints, but I decided to go with what I was hearing majority of people recommending.Ambiance is very ""local."" Nothing exquisite or decorated or curated or charming, but felt very Chicago. Don't really know how to describe that. It was packed - came around 8pm on a weekday, but luckily was seated pretty quickly since I was just 1. Most there were in families/bigger groups. I ordered the personal size deep dish cheese pizza. It was absolutely DELICIOUS. Caramelized butter crust (that is thick and chewy, but not overly so like some other deep dish pizza joints) and a solid amount of cheese (again... not too much cheese). Overall, loved my experience here and would definitely recommend. I easily scarfed down the personal size pizza for myself (but I also am a pretty big eater - probably would have been good to split this with 1 other person, or save 1 slice of pizza for the next day. But it was just too good!)Pretty affordable as well.Would highly recommend to someone wanting an authentic Chicago experience that doesn't feel too ""done up."" Great tasting pizza doesn't hurt either ;)"
Delicious deep dish pizza. Always packed. The crust was crunchy and delicious and so was the rest of the pizza. Would recommend this place over other deep dish places.
"First time at Pequod's last night, and I was very impressed. I don't usually toy with deep dish, but the crust was delicious, and the service was good.I will eat again."
I have eaten a lot of pizza in my days.  (My doctor would probably say way too much.)  But the thick crust pepperoni pizza at Pequod's is my absolute favorite.  Period.  The caramelized sauce and crust are done to perfection everytime.
One of the top five Chicago pizza joints. Love this place!
The best deal in Chicago: come during lunch during the weekdays for a personal deep dish pizza and a drink for $5. Pequod's is consistently ranked as one of the best deep dish places in Chicago and I have to say it is my absolute favorite.
"I'm not from Chicago and I haven't tried the other popular pizza joints, but I am from San Francisco and we do have some pretty darn good deep dish. Actually, it's so good that my favorite deep dish by far is still Little Star in SF, but Pequad's is definitely the runner up on my list. It was definitely memorable, my favorite parts being the burnt edges, but it's not as addicting as I was expecting.JONASAPPROVED!"
"This stuff is flame! Don't sleep on this joint, you tourist will regret it! Mouth watering pizza and a really smooth atmosphere will make wish you were born in such a city. This place is where real headz come and chill and enjoy a slice or two. Don't come to Chicago and not come to this place! Located in the center of yuppie ville, no need to worry about the neighborhood, just watch out for their delivery guys!"
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago! It's truly everything you assume it would be. Be aware of a long wait ahead- usually about 1.5 hours. Also the pizza usually takes 40-45 minutes to make as well. Great option is to sit at the bar and eat there for quicker pizza eating. :)
"I daresay that Pequod's Pizzeria, which is located in the vicinity of Wrigley Field (Chicago's baseball stadium), rivals even Lou Malnati's Pizzeria itself for best Chicago-style deep dish pizza!  I absolutely LOVED my deep dish pan pizza from Pequod's - it was perfectly tender in the middle and crispy on the outside, just as I like my pizza.  The restaurant itself is big and we didn't need reservations at 7pm on a Wednesday night in mid-October.  We were initially seated at a high-top table but requested to be seated at a booth and they were quite accommodating, which I appreciated.  The service was good overall but the food was even better.  I highly recommend the 7"" personal pan pizza - I got cheese only and it was perfect!"
"The pizza here is pretty good.  Not sure about all the hype, but I liked it a lot.   Takes a crazy long time, so plan accordingly."
The service was nice... pizza took about 20 mins... the wait is worth it though probably one of the best pizzas in Chicago if not the best I've ever had... I'll have to come back for the $4.95 lunch special personal pan pizza and a drink
"It was super busy when we came in for our reservation on Sunday. We still had to wait a little which was no big deal. For an appetizer we had the cheese bread and a salad, both were decent. Our table ordered three personal deep dish pizza's which took over an hour before we were served and each one was missing a topping. In fact, the table of four that was seated after us got their pizza's first. I'm guessing our server put our order in late and even wrong. Despite all that, the pizza's were full of fresh toppings and the crust is amazing! The sauce just soaked into the bread, but it wasn't soggy. And it was even better the next day, you don't even need to heat it up. I would definitely come back for another pie. Hopefully I won't have to wait so long to get my pizza next time."
"EAT HERE! The appetizers are hit or miss but lets face it you come here for the deep dish pizza with caramelized crust. I am more of the stuffed pizza fan but Pequod's is a front runner on the deep dish pizza side of Chicago pizza places! If someone offers to take me here I except without hesitation and have introduced several people to their pizza. Its worth it so go!!...be careful if seated upstairs, the stairway is a bit steep!"
"The best pizza in the city! Every time my family comes in from out of town, this is a must try. No one does deep dish like Pequod's"
"Best deep dish I've had during my visit in Chicago! I def prefer it over Giordano's. The crust is crispy on the rim and bottom which makes a big difference for me. You have the option of toppings and size. The personal pizza was more than enough to fill my appetite! The bartender was super friendly, the vibe and atmosphere was chill and enjoyable. Def felt the Chicago spirit here. Sit at the bar for the ultimate experience!"
"Be aware that like most deep dish places out takes a while for your pizza to be made, but luckily here the appetizers are pretty good. The cheese garlic bread was just okay, but the jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, and mozzarella sticks were on point. Pizza uses a lighter crust than other deep dish places which I think is a plus."
"Loved this deep dish pizza. Takes a while. Comes out on cast iron skillet, but flavor of crust, sauce, and toppings are legit."
"Bomb pizza, great beer.  Staff was awesome, so was the dessert.  What more do you need?"
"I was drawn to Pequod's because of its $4.95 lunch special. The lunch special is a personal one-topping deep dish pizza and a drink of your choice. What a deal. The pizza is enough for 2 people, and the drink comes with free refills. I ordered the deep dish with giardiniera peppers, and this was the perfect combination of mozzarella cheese baked into the pizza ""crust"" shell. The peppers and sauce are on top of the pizza, and there was a good ratio of peppers to sauce. The sauce is well-seasoned, and not overly sweet or spicy. Pequod's is located in a line of businesses on a busy street. There is street parking nearby. The establishment itself is dimly lit, which gives it a bar-like feel. There is a full service bar and flat screen TVs showing sports games above the bar. The space itself is small, but I would recommend it for a meeting with friends as many people were doing or just a solo lunch. The service is fast and friendly, and your pizza arrives in 20 minutes with no wait."
"I fly out from Los Angeles and come straight here. Best pie I've ever found in Chicago. There's lots of infamous spots, but this is the one. Not just this location, but any one of the Pequods you'll have the best pie; period love is an understatement. Best of the best is close."
"Usually not a fan of Chicago style pizza, but Pequod's pan pizza is oh so good.  As others have stated, its the crust that makes this stuff so crack-like good.  If, you know, you're into crack and all.  The crust is flakey and buttery on the bottom, but the prize is the burnt cheese crust on the edges.  Seriously, you need to monitor your fellow diners to make sure they're not stealing the burnt cheese crust edges of pieces that do not belong to them.  I know from experience.Ok, ok...its not all about the crust, 'bout the crust....   In addition, Pequod's is generous with the toppings and their sauce is good, too.  I've only had the pan pizza, and only delivery, so I can't comment on the other food items or dining in.  And the delivery can take up to 2 hrs on a Friday evening.  And yes, it was worth every darn minute of the wait.  Like crack, you gotta wait for your fix!"
"Personally, I don't love deep dish pizza, pizza in general is never my go to but Pequod's is a great compromise for me and my boyfriend who loves deep dish pizza!I've been here a few times and the pizza is great if you prefer more dough over cheese. They're usually pretty busy so i definitely recommend preparing to wait an hour or so on the weekends. Also really appreciated them delivering to me when I lived on Adams St (which was one block south of their delivery area). I called on a Saturday night and asked, they had extra drivers that night, we had pizza delivered to us an hour later!"
"Now just a disclaimer that I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza. I'm much more of a thin crust person, but even I like this pizza. I guess it's kind of more a pan pizza than true deep dish but I don't care, it's deep dish enough for me. They cook it to have this crispy halo of cheese around the crust which is amazing!! I've found that Giordanos has too much cheese and not enough tomato sauce, and I don't like the buttery crust of Lous so this is my perfect deep dish pie. Perfect ratios of all the pizza elements with a cheesy halo, what more could you ask for? It's a bit of a wait and it's just street parking but it's worth it."
"Their pan pizza is good. I wouldn't get thin crust as it's not the same and here are better options, but their pan pizza is bueno."
"I came here based on word of mouth, having heard about it for so long.  If I was just judging the pizza,  I would give it another star, as it was very good.  The service, not so much.We came in on a weekday afternoon and there were about 4 other tables being served.  We waited about 15 minutes before anyone came over, and then after ordering drinks, about another 15 minutes before they arrived.  This was draft beer, by the way, and the bartender was about... 7 feet away from our table.  This is a very small place, so it really starts to feel purposeful when you are being ignored for that long.We would have liked to order more beer but we never got the chance to.  We placed our food order and the waitress left, at which point I'm assuming she was abducted or went into a coma in the back of the restaurant.  After about 30 minutes of staring into empty beer glasses, our pizza came.  We asked the bus boy to send our waitress back and he nodded, but she never appeared.The pizza was really good, super crispy, melty, and I really like the personal pizza size.  The sauce was also very flavorful.  Two thumbs way up!When we were done eating though, we had to ask the hostess for the check, as the waitress had never come back, and at that point I would have even just wanted a glass of water to wash my meal down with... so I'm not sure if I'll go back.  I'll probably try delivery instead!"
"Pequods - this is what Chicago natives will tell you when they ask if you ever had a good Deep dish, I mean really deep dish pizza before.Having lived and worked in many different cities before I have had pizzas, normal and the exceptionally thin crusted ones as well. But not the deep dish pizza where you need to navigate through this deep dish pizza with a knife and a fork. Yes this is deep dish, not possible to do it with your bare hands, well yes you can but it will be a mess!The deep dish pizza is good but it makes you bloated after a second piece. Apart from Pequods there is also Giordano's in Central Chicago near to the Willis Tower. Nice but you have to wait for your order, about 20-25 minutes for the deep dish pizza to arrive.Try it! It's an experience."
Oh my goodness. This is my favorite deep dish pizza place of all time. You can't go wrong with any type of pizza here.  I always get extra sauce on my pizzas here which makes them ten times better. You HAVE to go here if you are in Chicago and love pizza.
"For the people who give this place a bad review due to ""burnt crust"" are idiots. That is caramelized parmesan cheese baked into the dough as it cooks. Due a little homework if your visiting or ask about it at the time you get the pizza.  So if your looking for a great deep dish pizza then this place is top 3 in Chicago   Suggest getting the sausage. All the sausage is specially made with their recipe from a local meet place in Chicago. It will take some time to get the food so be patient. Staff is great and efficient. Keep in mind it's hard to just walk in during the dinner time or weekend evening and get a seat. It can take 2 hours if you don't have a reservation. The pizza is top notch. I cannot speak to the rest of the menu, but who goes here and orders anything else anyway."
It's one of the three top pizzas for sure. You're doing this for a chicago tradition. Not for the taste Giordanos is my go-to
The pan pizza had an excellent buttery crust that complemented the loads of toppings well!
"If you get it delivered, make sure it is uncut and you reheat in the oven for a few minutes. Arrives soggy a lot or the time."
"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a super big fan of pizza, no matter it's shape or form, but I can appreciate a good deal when I see it. My wife and I wanted to experience the Chicago Deep Dish pizza and found this place to be well loved by the Yelp community. First of all, if you are relying on public transportation, be willing to go on a mini hike across the LePaul campus to get to this little gem. We came here on a weekday, just barely making it to the lunch specials, which was a personal 7"" cheese pizza for less than $5. That is freaking amazing! Of course, we splurged a little bit more, added numerous toppings, and got a small side salad for $2 and a local, honey infused root beer. Alright, I wasn't a big fan of the salad or the root beer, but it wasn't that bad either. You can see from the menu that Pequod makes each pizza individually, with a minimum wait of 30 minutes to accommodate for the toppings. I initially thought we'd be safe from that wait time since the restaurant was fairly empty (which is unusual, based on the reviews), but I guess the wait time is unique to a deep dish pizza. MY biggest disappointment, aside from the pizza being salty, was that it was served on a regular plate, instead of a deep dish. Ok, so 7"" pizza may not have needed it, but it would have given an unique illusion of a deep dish pizza. We eagerly scarfed down the pizza and found it to be perfect sufficient for the two of us. Unfortunately, I got incredibly nauseous a few hours after lunch, so I had to dock a point for that. Food: 3 starsPrice: 4 starsAmbiance: 3 starsService: 3.5 stars."
"The best deep dish in Chicago, hands down. Took my cousin from New York, he is now flipped!"
I was in Chicago for a business trip and wanted to try some Chicago style pizza.  Our Uber driver told us Pequod's was the place and he was right.  I love good pizza and this may have actually been the best Pizza I have ever had.  If you are in Chicago and have the time (45 min wait for us) it is worth it!
Best deep dish in Chicago that I have eaten at!!
"hands down chicago's best. the sausage is amazing, the crust is killa! love, love, love."
"I'm not a native Chicagoan, but to me this is the best pizza in Chicago. I'm not a fan of deep dish so Pequod's pan pizza is my go-to. Whenever friends or family come to visit we love having an excuse to get Pequod's. The dough has a great bite and the edges get caramelized to crunchy cheesy perfection.  I'm pretty sure it's understood in our house that stealing the amazing cheesy bit of crust from someone's slice is unforgivable. We always get their sausage as a topping. I think they make it themselves and it has so much fennel. Yum! Also - the salad! They cut the cheese into little whales. Love it. The only advice I would give on this place is that the pizza is so much better if you go have it in the restaurant vs. delivery."
"Really casual atmosphere, plenty of room inside, but expect a wait due to this places popularity.Service was great and the prices were reasonable. Came here as part of a bachelor party weekend, and 9 dudes definitely grubbed down. They're thick deep dished pizzas. 4 large pizzas were more than enough for us all, not to mention we also got wings.I'll be honest, I'm not a huge deep dish pizza fan, but won't hold that against the specialty of this place! Be sure to make reservations for a large party!"
"THAT CARMELIZED CRUST THO. If you love Chicago and love pizza do yourself a favor and get here. The toppings are delicious and plentiful, the beer menu is great, the service is good and the ambience, is, well, just ok. Not a deal breaker. It's definitely worth ordering a large and taking the rest home with you."
"Wow! Pequods! Finally!! After a very long time of anticipating Pequod's pizza and taking our out of town guests, I would say Pequods should not be rated as a deep dish pizza because it is not a deep dish pizza. It's like compare apples to oranges.  The pizza is delicious and one of the best pan pizzas, had a little resemblance to Pizza Hut's pan date I say, but it does.  My favorite Chicago deep dish is still definitely Lou Manalti's and Giordianno's! Will I go to Pequods again?? Of course!!! It was a great pizza. If we were to just talk about pizza's, Pequods is in my top 3. Yum!"
"I'm going to say something blasphemous here and say this is the best Chicago pizza out there. I definitely take folks from out of town here more often than their more famous counterparts. Can't go wrong at Pequod's, especially before catching a movie or heading over to B&N to browse some books."
"I don't like deep dish pizza.  Sorry.  I said it.  But THIS deep dish pizza... I love.So delicious!   Best deep dish I've had, and I've tried all the classics (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno).  I don't know what it is, but it didn't feel overly heavy to me.. The crust was delicious, and the filling was gooey yumminess.  The four of us split a large (way too big for us), and we split the pizza in half.  Half was Italian Beef + Giardiniera, and the other was Spinach, fresh garlic, and mushrooms.  Both sides were amazing.  Thinking about it makes me hungry, and I wish I could have some now. :(  Come to Dallas, Pequod's!!!"
"BEST PIZZA IVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!Hands down best pizza I have everrrrrrrr had!!!!!!!Pizza: The crust was amazing like non other, every bite had a crunch to it, and best part was even though it was deep dish I did not feel like I was eathing something that was really heavy.Atmosphere: Place is huge, two floors of pizza heaven, I suggest you call ahead if time and make reservations.Service: All of the staff was friendly EXCEPT for the girl taking our order, from the second I sat down she was giving my group an attitude, it was obvious she did not want to be there. After asking for her opinion on a few items and getting such a salty response all I wanted was to have her leave our table and stop ruining the happy vibe we had that night. Its a shame because there are a lot of people who would love to have a job these days....If the owners are reading my review put the server with the attitude in check....server number AZ010 on my receipt"
Pan pizza like you dreamed of. Lots of toppings. Mine had peppers onions meatballs and sausage. Started with a Caesar salad. Followed it with the crispy crust deep dish. Be ready to wait an hour but worth the wait. Trust me when I tell you there's very little that believe is worth a long wait. I'm an instant gratification kind of guy. This was worth it. Parking is on street and a challenge. Find a way to get there.
"If you are in the mood for deep dish, Pequod's is hands down the best in Chicago. That burnt crust is one of a kind. However, you will need to work to get your pie with waits frequently over an hour. Love the pizza...hate the wait."
"Crust is absolutely amazing. The actual pizza has too much sauce, and too little cheese. Overall, really good!"
Chicago city staple. Not the traditional deep dish but still amazing. Has been featured on many food channels.
"This is the best of the best of the best... provided you order it fresh, at the restaurant. I dislike bar atmospheres, which this place definitely has, but I more than tolerate the dark, the noise, the raucousness for the sheer sublimity of this perfect expression of Chicago Pizza. The platonic ideal, to wax philosophical. It's also more than worth the long wait/the long prep time if you call ahead (recommended). It's a chain, but *barely,* with just one other location--the original, in the suburbs. Nothing like the tourist-friendly polish of Giordano's/Lou's, with a freezer in the front for tourists to ship ""authentic Chicago""!!!! pizza souvenirs to their buddy Joe in Montana. Now, it's well-known that the mere fact of being geographically served within Chicago's city limits does not a true Chicago Pizza make. There are four or five valid choices, in order of my personal preference: Pequod's, Giordano's, Uno's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's. The final four in that list are pretty close in ranking, and reasonable people can quibble about the order. Pequod's is in the #1 slot by leaps and bounds. Be prepared for a thick, doughy, bready crust which caramelizes to crisp perfection. It's not ""burnt"" and won't give you cancer. Just exquisitely cooked cheese and tomato sauce. The deepest pan of all deep-dish joints. Fresh ingredients (I usually order with double mushroom, broccoli, and garlic). And the most FILLING pizza you've ever had. Two or three slices are all most people can handle.As I said at the start, this pizza is really best eaten fresh. Ordered as delivery or takeout and reheated at home still results in an excellent, exceptional pie... but a good chunk of the magic is lost and it becomes more in-line with the others."
"Came here in the middle of December for what my Chicago friends said is very good deep dish. Actually their exact words were ""this is where Chicagoans go"" Was not expecting this at all. Pizza was very good but it is not deep dish....I know shocking right? It's a stuffed pie not deep dish, and yes there is a difference. Nevertheless it's still a really interesting take on a classic, one that I wasn't aware of til that fateful winter night. Go, be happy and enjoy ""stuffing"" your face."
"Best deep dish pizza on the planet! Seriously. Takes a little while to cook, restaurant is usually packed, but it's worth it."
"When I am craving pizza and happen to be in the city, I always head to Pequods! Located on the corner of Webster and Clybourn in LP, it is the perfect spot for Chicago style pizza. My favorite thing to order is the pan pizza with extra sauce and tomatoes. The sauce is on the sweeter side, which I love! The appetizers are pretty good as well. The chicken wings and fried mushrooms are my favorite though. Every time I've been there, the service is great. Friendly and fast!  I think Chicago wins with all the pizza choices, but Pequods is by far on top of the list!"
"I hosted my birthday here last night and requested a table for 10 a few days prior to the day at 7pm on a Saturday (a very busy time). I received a confirmation within 20 mins. I then wanted to increase the reservation by 2 and also received a quick confirmation.Upon arriving with many people waiting, we were seated right on time. It made my birthday experience great and is much appreciated. I highly recommend this place and also utilizing the prioritized seating request. Lastly, the pizza and service was great as always! Thank you!"
"I'm a big fan of Lou Malnati's for deep dish and it's my go to place but I kept hearing great things about Pequois and wanted to give it a try. The wait on a Saturday was pretty long (we were quotes 2 hours but it ended up being 1 hour). There's a Barnes and Nobles across the street so you can pass the time there. The restaurant/bar is pretty small although there is an upstairs I didn't see. We got down to business and ordered a small sausage along with a Pequod salad. The salad was standard and the whale cheese was a cute touch. The deep dish was generous and delicious. That infamous caramelized crust lived up to the hype, the crust is lighter than Lou's, and the sauce is bright and flavorful. I was bummed the sausage wasn't an entire layer like at Lou's but that might be personal preference. Overall, really good deep dish that I think will win over devotees and first timers alike. A fun atmosphere that is a great place to grab a few drinks and eat some pizza."
Love the pizza and wings!!!  Service is okay. Wait for delivery is usually 1:45 minutes so I end up picking it up which isn't ideal because It's usually a mad house in there. If they could improve the delivery service I'd give five stars for sure.
"If I were to come down from a mountaintop and found a religion, I would never be more certain of anything in my life than I am of the unassailable quality of this pizza. The crust is Dante's Paradiso in cheese and bread, and the sauce and toppings are the east, the sun. Truly cannot recommend higher to any lover of deep dish. Pequod's Pizza is truly the still point of a turning world. It reminds Chicago of what it should be, and indeed all that it COULD be, on a daily basis. Service was pretty good"
"This deep dish pizza is amazing, from the toppings to the caramelized crust. I recently came to the Pequod's on Clybourn on a trip to Chicago and felt at home in the restaurant. It smells great, and there's a great atmosphere. If you like eating pizza and watching sports, this is the restaurant for you."
The best pizza in the city! The service was lackluster on our second visit but the pizza is fantastic
"Me and my BF decided to get carry out from this place as a Saturday night treat. I called to order and was told it would be an hour and 15minute wait for a carry out pizza. I was a little shocked but said it was fine since neither of us were starving. We arrived to pick it up at exactly the 1 hour 15mins mark and were treated by hoards of people crowding the entrance and spilling out onto the street. Once inside, it made sense. It was a Saturday night and this place is a little on the smaller side, so lots of people were waiting to be seated. I over heard the hostess saying it was a 1.5-2hour wait for a table, wow.We ended up waiting in a slow-moving line to pick up our pizza. It was a little annoying how long it took to simply pick up a carry out pizza. And, we were lucky out order was actually ready when we got there. Some people had to wait even longer after paying for their order to be ready. Also, this place isn't super expensive, which I like. I'm pretty sure a medium pan pizza is only $16. The only outrageous thing is that each extra topping adds like $2.50, which adds up quickly. We paid $23 for a medium pepperoni and sausage pizza.Once we finally got the pizza, it was good! I really really love the crust on this pizza. It's the best pan pizza crust I've ever had--nice and dark, but not burnt, and super crispy. I also loved the quality of the ingredients: nice, huge chunks of tasty Italian sausage and literally the entire pizza was covered in pepperoni which was awesome. The sauce was also good. My only complaint is that I felt the pizza was super skimpy on cheese at some points I was like, does this pizza even have cheese on it!? But seriously, this pizza is damn good.Overall, I'd avoid this place on the weekend unless you're willing to wait 1-2+hours for your meal! But definitely check it out on a week night, this pizza isbomb!!"
"Got a large pan pizza, half pepperoni, half mushrooms and green peppers. It's appropriately filled up 4 people, and compared to the other major pizza spots around town it was actually a little bit cheaper(large pizza w/2 toppings $24.65). The first bites were actually pretty amazing; the cheese by then was still very gooey and, being a pan pizza, the crust was crisp but also incredibly fluffy. It's not like the buttercrust at Lou's where you have something of a more pot-pie consistency, this is straight up large pan pizza. Also, was a little skeptical about the caramelized cheese crust at first, but after trying it I'm a fan. Not as incredibly amazing as most people say it is(I mean, at that point you can't really even taste that it's cheese), but the texture is great and I think I'd prefer it to other deep dish pizzas in that regard(after all, you're still getting plenty of the thicky doughy goodness on the base of the pizza...no need to have more on the sides). The pepperoni were nothing special, and would opt for the sausage next time.One dangerous downside...after initially amazing first few slices, once it cools down a little bit you actually realize how much of it is actually dough compared to filling. Whereas with say giordano's you really have a ton of sauce and toppings and the pizza dough is maybe 1/3 the width of the entire pizza, here it's the opposite; the dough actually accounts for like 75% of the height. Once it cools down this becomes very apparent, as you notice the thin layer of cheese and toppings compared to the dough. That said it's all super fluffy so it doesn't feel as if there is that ratio upon eating it, but it does take its toll after a while.So final deep dish verdict? Actually a fan, and would say this hits the right price point too. Only major cons are that I didn't get the sausage(not their fault), and that there is a lot of (albeit very fluffy) dough which makes the ratio seem a bit off."
"Pequods has been on my bucketlist for a while now and today I finally got to experience the deep dish and it did not disappoint! First off this restaurant has 2 floors, the bottom floor was really busy so we were asked if we would like to sit upstairs and so we did. There were TVs to keep us busy while we were waiting for the personal deep dish pizza. The lunch special of $4.95 a personal cheese pizza with a fountain drink is an absolute steal and I really enjoyed it. The crust is the best deep dish crust I have tasted to date, it is soft and it melts in your mouth. Everything about the deep dish is delicious from the cheese to the sauce to the crust. It is also very filling! I will definitely be coming back here."
"What's the all the hype about Pequod's? It's not even deep dish - it's a pan pizza. Seriously, check the menu. It's a pan pizza than a traditional Chicago deep dish so there is a lot of dough - kind of like focaccia bread. There are two things going for their pizza - the burnt cheese/crust and the tomato sauce. Yes, burnt food can lead to cancer but it tastes so good. Why can't things like cheese and butter be good for you? The pizza is generously drenched in the tomato sauce but I didn't mind because it was thick, robust, and zesty. I would eat a bowl of pasta topped with the sauce since it was that good. If DePaul students weren't spoiled enough, the Lincoln Park location is open until 2am on the weekends vs. the 10pm hour at the Morton Grove location. Pequod's - not quite a true Chicago deep dish pizza but still good."
"This place is legitimately one of my favorite places to get deep dish pizza. Their crust is light and buttery, but the burnt cheese crust that you save for last is the best part. Also, their service is great. Everyone is nice and friendly; they do their part to make you feel at home."
Best deep dish pizza I've had. The sauce and the crust were equally delicious. One of the toppings we ordered was with garlic and it was a lot of garlic! We ordered their buffalo and bbq wings and the bbq sauce was amazing!
Who doesn't love Pequod's pizza?  Was in before a movie at Webster and enjoyed the classic pan pizza with burnt crust. Yum!!  Just head's up the service is (still?) touch and go. Are they all just spacy or just always really busy? I don't know...they are nice enough and the pizza is delicious.
"BEST PIZZA PLACE HANDS DOWN. I have lived in Chicago my whole life, and this is the best!! Awesome atmosphere and when you call ahead they will put you first on the waiting list.I'd recommend calling a few hours before you get there- don't just show up, the wait is usually over an hour!"
"Really is as good as it gets. No specialty pizza needed. Classic cheese, sausage or pepperoni is enough to make anyone believe that the pan pizza is the perfect style pizza there is. And Pequod's sizzles. The cheese is puffy and stringy. When you bite in, you keep biting for a hot second. There's a lot of pizza there.I'd eat it at least once a week if it was more conveniently located!!"
"Holy cow. I finally tried Pequods pizza after living in Chicago almost my whole life. What took me so long. My 21 year old daughter and i had the day together today and she wanted to try it. It was amazing. The burnt cheese crust was something amazing and absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked. The restaurant is really cool inside. Ambiance is terrific. It looks small when you walk in but they have multiple seating areas. Parking is a challenge but well worth it. Service was a little slow as our server wasn't as attentive as you would like, but the food really made up for it. Prepare to wait to be seated at peak times. Go on off hours to get in and out faster. I can't wait to go back again..."
"My first experience with  Chicago deep dish turned out to be enjoyable. I shared a sausage onion pizza with a friend. The sauce was very good, the crust was deliciously crispy and the dough was what I expected - a bit soggy but I guess that's Chicago right? Still doesn't beat New York though!"
Hands down best deep dish in Chicago! Worth the 2 hour delivery. The pepperoni pizza is a must order when ever I have friends in from out of town. The burnt cheese crust sets it in a class of its own.
"Wow, more like eating a casserole with bread underneath but very tasty, fresh and light and rich, somehow simultaneously. I was good for a slice and a half and called it quits before things got out of hand. Amazed that the place was jammed at 1pm Sunday. They sure have it going on."
"We got pizza to-go, and it was fantastic.  There really isn't a place to stand and wait, so make sure that you are not 20 minutes early like I was.Pizza was fantastic, and the staff was really on top if taking care of me the entire time I was there.  Offering me water while I wait, and checking on my pizza every couple of minutes.  I'm pretty sure that my pizza was in my hands less than a minute from leaving the oven.Overall it was a fantastic experience."
"Hipster atmosphere. Crowded most times we go. Decent crafts beers. Great deep dish pizza with primo ingredients. Could argue that this is the best pizza joint in Chicago. Expect about a 45-60 minute wait once you order your pizza. I usually get a deep dish [pan pizza] w/ extra cheese, sausage and pepperoni. The ingredients are huge too. Not those little sausage balls at Pizza Hut. I don't order extra cheese at any other pizza spot but here i think it's necessary. Just don't think it's enough cheese on their pan pizzas. Pizzas come out great every time. The only downside is that once you wait an hour for your pizza by the time it gets there is still too hot to eat so you end up waiting longer to eat it.  Fml. But with great conversation and a few drinks you'll be eating in no time. Really enjoy this spot. Would recommend a few more beer selections but that's just being picky. Definitely  a must go to  spot in Chicago.Almost forgot to mention the cheese melted to edge of the cast iron cooking pan. Cheese gradually goes from cheesy to burnt. Sounds weird but it give the crust a nice carmelized taste. Loves it!!!"
Ordered pizza for the first time as we like the thinner crust vs the traditional deep dish here in Chgo. Prepared perfectly and tasty. Delivery timing was also great. I highly recommend. Trying Pizanno's soon as a comparison .
"Hands down,  the best pan pizza in Chicago.  The pans are so old and seasoned from repeat use, the flavor is out of this world.Order wait is like any pizza place, it takes a while, the place is a bit crmped but always busy because it rocks."
"this is the deep dish place--excellent without being a soggy gooey mess. Also, since it is so filling, the price per head is very good. Second to none for deep dish and a pretty decent thin pizza too, a good bargain."
"I've heard that real Chicagoan's don't like deep dish. Whatever. This place was backed and decked to the walls with Blackhawks stuff. The best part of the meal, but also kind of the gripe about it, was our pizza. We ordered a spinach and tomato pie, but they told us it was a mushroom pie? (It wasn't--just spinach only, no tomato). Not sure how this all got bungled up but at the end of it a $27 medium pie was more than enough for the three of us for dinner. The pies take a while, especially since it was busy, but it is well worth the wait--just get a pitcher and put in an app order. When the crispy edged, gooey pizza finally arrived, we demolished it."
"Grew up in Morton Grove, a few minutes drive from the original. May be the best pizza in the US! This location has late hours, befitting it's location, and been here many times with my daughter. Always had good food and service."
"Great deep dish! If you're an out of tower and want to experience Chicago's pizza, you have to come here. I was a little worried because I like crispy crust pizzas and a thick crust made me wonder how good it would be when its soggy, but boy was I wrong. It added an extra bready flavor to the pizza and Meade it extremely hearty."
"::phone ringing::Pequod's: Pequod's, can you please hold?Me: Yes.Pequod's: How can I help you?Me: Can I get an order for pickup?Pequod's: Is this John?Me: Yes.Pequod's: What would you like?Me: Large pan pepperoni.Pequod's: Is that all?Me: Yes.Pequod's: Ok, large pan pepperoni. 45 minutes.Me: Thank you."
"Wow.  How do I describe this place.  It's Chicago style pizza, but better!  They put cheese on the crust.  How can that go wrong?"
"We are from Miami and wanted to go to where the locals have deep dish pizza. Luckily one of our uber drivers suggested Pequods and let me tell you it was SPECTACULAR. People say it's more of a pan pizza, but to me it felt like a deep dish. Anyway way better then Giordano's which is where all the tourists go to. You can get decent deep dish pizza where the tourists tend to stay at but if you are willing to take a 15 mins uber drive from downtown to Pequods it will not disappoint!"
"Lives up to the hype and worth the wait. it's the best deep dish, bar none. I am not a huge fan of deep dish generally but this place won me over! Get enough for leftovers and pop right in the oven. You won't be disappointed, as it is just as good day 2."
"I'm normally a thin-crust/NY-style pizza fan, but I'm down for deep dish pizza ANYTIME if it's from Pequod's. It was so good that I overate and had a stomach ache the rest of the afternoon.Keep in mind that you end up waiting ~20-40 minutes or so for your pizza since it's a deep dish and needs to bake longer.   There are a lot of pizza joints to choose from in Chicago, but  if you're trying to pick one, Pequod's should be at the top of that list."
"Although my friend who suggested this place has never been here, she said this place is talked about by everyone so we made our reservation around noon for a party of 11 to dine at 7pm.  We had other friends joined us and called them about 3pm to change it from a party of 11 to 15 including kids.  So reservation is a must if you're with a large group.When we arrived, the wait wasn't long at all, about 10mins before they escorted us upstairs to our seats.  The place was jammed packed so I'm glad they take reservations.  The waitress was very attentive as she took our orders before everyone arrived since the pizza does take a bit long to make.We started out with a pitcher of beer, salad, and some breaded shrooms.  The breaded shrooms are must haves.  They were very flavorful.  The kids loved it as well.  It was all gone before the rest of our party arrived so we placed another order of them.  We ordered 2 large thin crust and a large pan pizza.  As everyone was arriving, we ordered another pan pizza and a couple more pitchers of beer.  For a party of 15, 4 pizza was more than enough. The pizza was delicious.  Very flavorful and the crust was the best I'd ever had.  It was nice and crispy.  I have never had a caramelized crust pizza before and I must say, it was awesome. The price was fair and wasn't to pricey.  I would definitely recommend this place but do keep in mind, it's a long wait if you're there on weekend because we were there on a tuesday night and the line was super long already.  So glad we made reservations. It is also a kid friendly place.  One of the best pizza places I've been to."
"We stopped in for pizza having been told this is one of the best in Chicago for deep dish and they weren't wrong. However, in trying it for the first time, I don't think my husband and I are a fan of the pizza style itself. The service was wonderful, pizza arrived quicker than what we were told to expect, and the environment was great. I just wasn't a fan of the sauce and my husband didn't like the crunch of the bottom crust. Great pizza, just not our preferred way to eat it. We'd probably go back, just to try the thin crust version!"
"I live in San Antonio and wanted some Chicago deep dish pizza! One morning hopped a plane and took the ""L"" toward downtown. I was told by a former resident of Chicago to try this place! Walked around 1130 just in time for the $4.99 lunch special. Which was a personal pizza and a drink! Long story short the pizza was amazing I recommend getting sausage on it! Pairs perfect with the local beers. Took one to go back to Texas. Got back home the same day and went to bed with a full belly! I'll be back for another day trip Chicago! Worth it!!!!!"
"This is my favorite deepdish in the city. Their caramelized crust is the bomb, and they have a killer lunch special during the week. They are a little pricier and the waits are longer at night, so that is the only reason for the four stars. Awesome pizza though, and great appetizers too."
"A++. Warning: can get crowded. They handle it well, but there's only so much they can do. We waited 1.25 hours on a holiday weekend night to sit, and once we did, people were waiting 2 hours or more. So, come on an odd hour, or a non-busy night. Otherwise, do like we did: bring a good book, sit on a bench outside (or order a drink at the bar next door), and wait. It's worth it."
"I won't get into the debate of New York Pizza and Chicago-style Pizza, but I will say that Pequod's definitely exceeded my expectations. Everyone told me that this was better than Lou Malnati's, so I had to try it out when I was in town visiting some friends. Tables were very crowded, but we managed to come at just the right time.The bar scene was great, and we were definitely stuffed after ordering our own specialty pizzas. The crust is great and the amount of cheese to sauce is just right. Gotta love that stuff. Just wish it didn't take so long for to come out. I know it's common place for deep dish to take longer, just had to say it.One thing I love was the presence of Fat Tire. I know Fat Tire might be pretty commonplace in Chicago, but it's actually hard to come by in New York City. I definitely drank my share of Fat Tires while I was eating, which made the experience even better. I'll definitely be back, next time I'm in the area. Might need one more visit to push me over the edge and declare deep dish pizza as the better alternative to NYC pizza."
"Once you've gone Pequod, you'll never be able to go back to regular pizza. Seriously, I do not know how I am going to be able to order and eat pizza in Saint Louis again. I was in Chicago for business and meet up with two local Yelpers, Lupe d. and Damian P. for lunch. If it were not for their hospitality I would have never discovered Pequod's and true pizza.Side note: Meeting up with a fellow Yelper is easier then someone on those Internet dating sites. Yelpers post ""real and current"" pictures. Both Damian and I started out with a Pequot Salad (Half Size). What attracted me to this amazing salad, is that they use no Iceberg lettuce. I have a strong dislike for Iceberg and was thrilled that they use Romaine. They then garnish it a variety of fresh vegetable toppings, pepperoni, pepperoncini and cheese. If it were not for Lupe being a regular and alerting us to take note of the cheese. Damian and I both would missed the detail that the cheese is sliced in the shape of a whale. Another big bonus point is that they always serve the salad dressing on the side in a little cup. Besides the conversation and meeting fellow Yelpers from another city, the piece of resistance was the pizza itself.  Being a man from Saint Louis, I am use to thin crust and not a fan of ""deep dish pizza"".  However, when I saw the description how they make their pan pizza on the menu, I was sold. Pizza prepared in cast iron pans that have been blackened by decades of seasoning, is a winner. Then being told that the overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust had me saying, ""thank-you Jesus"". My personalized 7"" size pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage and jalapeño blew me away. I will tell you, Pequod's does not skimp on toppings, the tomato sauce is rich and the mozzarella cheese melted perfectly. The service was friendly. We had a main server who was there when we needed her and other team members assisted making sure our food was delivered to our table in a timely fashion. I have found my pizza heaven, I just wish it were closer to home."
"Best pizza in the world! Pepperoni, sausage, meatball.. love them all. Delivery can take awhile and sometimes may make sense to order half baked and finish in your oven. (Honestly, it comes out perfect.) I'd avoid getting too many vegetable toppings on same pie, as the veggies are cut kinda big. Lunch special is the best deal on the planet. Been eating this for a decade and never disappointed."
"This is without a doubt the best pizza in Chicago! they do a great job handling how busy they always are too, expect to wait a little but, but 100% worth it"
"My family and I visited weeks back and I'm just finding time to review. This pizza was iconic back in the day and I haven't visited in many years. Maybe it's unfair to compare to my memory but our last visit was mediocre at best. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread and it was warm, gooey and satisfying! We followed this with a pepperoni pan pizza which is their version in the deep dish pizza.  We all enjoyed it but feel eve crust was soggy and impossible to pick up and eat causing us to have to use fork and knife. This was fine for me and the hubby but the kids had a difficult time and made a mess. Service was a bit slow but it was a packed house."
"A little crowded.  A little hot.  But great bar atmosphere, and great chicago style pizza.  Burnt cheesy crust is fantastic."
"Good pizza! We got a medium pan pizza. Very filling obviously with good flavors. Delivery took about an hour and 20 min but they told us that right away and asked if it was ok so I appreciated that. It was good deep dish, the caramelized crust was pretty good. Little burnt but it was our first time getting this pizza so maybe that's how it always is? We liked it. Might try and eat there next time I don't know if delivery did it justice but even the delivery guy was really nice so I can even say they have good service haha."
"It's an o.k. spot for pizza. It's not the best deep dish pizza in the city. but it's also not the worst. It's an alright spot. It's comfortable, casual, and affordable. I would go again and I would recommend it to friends too. It's a good place to drop in after seeing something at Steppenwolf theater, or after Spamilton at the Royal George Theatre like I did."
I really liked the deep dish here! The pizza was soft and moist but the crust was still nice and crisp! It was worth the wait! I think their pizza is a good size and can definitely serve up to 4 people. Definitely check this place out if you're in Chicago!
"Okay, I am generally just not a fan of deep dish pizza but after checking out some reviews, it sounded like this needed to be a must do. It was pretty tasty! Great ratio of cheese/sauce/dough -- even for that doughy deep dish, haha. Going off hours (e.g. the bar on Saturday afternoon) may be your best bet to avoid the line."
My favorite Chicago style pizza joint. The crust makes this pizza stand out. Also had the wings which were good while waiting for the pizza.
I really like the pizza have had it at the restaurant and take out. Good customer service good pizza. Couldn't ask for more.
"First time having pizza in Chicago and my friend suggested here over all the places in downtown where i was staying. There was a wait for parties of 2+ but we were seated right away at a 2 top. Place isn't too big and is kind of dark like a pub. They said about an hour for the pizza so we ordered wings in the meantime. They were actually really good and I'm picky with wings. They were big and crispy and not too spicy or saucy. The pizza didn't really take an hour i don't think. Im not  huge sauce fan so I'm glad i tried this pizza rather than the 'traditional Chicago style deep dish' that has all the sauce on the top. It wasn't too heavy and doughy. Could've had a tad more cheese but the caramelized crust totally made up for it. The bill wasn't too bad for a medium pie, wings and two drinks, but we did only got one topping. Came to $40. Only thing that could've been better was the service. I mean our waitress was training someone and it  was busy so she was dealing with a lot. I just could've used a refill :)"
"In my opinion, this is the go-to deep dish pizza place in Chicago. The cheese baked into the crust is what sets it apart, giving the pizza an extra little something. And surprisingly it's light enough that you can get three slices and not feel stuffed. Or maybe that's just me."
"Wow, that is an excellent pizza. Believe the hype folks.  We ordered a meatball and gardinera pan and it was delicious.  No wait, on a Saturday afternoon.  Wife says we'll be back to try the thin crust too."
"Great pizza. The appetizers are horrible especially the bruschetta, but the pizza is to die for. I really liked the grungy vibes of this place, and all the AC/DC & Led Zeppelin playing. We got a deep dish with pepperoni and that was the way to go. It was recommended that we don't load the pizza with too many toppings.  It was two of us and we both can eat a lot, and the small size pizza was plenty. If you love deep dish pizza, this is a must try."
Thin crust pizza had fresh ingredients! The jalapeños and olives were so good. I like the flaky thin crust. Tastes almost like a thin croissant. The small was perfect for two people. Pizza took a while but I guess you gotta wait for quality food. Iced tea tasted watered down but I didn't give them a chance to fix it so can't dock them too much for that. Manager was attentive and was there to get things done!
"I've never had an issue with the wait, and it's right across from the Barnes and Noble I frequent and Wegster theater. I think the longest I've ever waited was fifteen minutes despite everyone always saying it's a long wait (lucky timing, mayhaps?). I got the sampler platter once which was ""meh"", but what you're really there for is the pizza, I imagine.I've had the pineapple and ham, the sausage and mushrooms (and I usually hate mushrooms) and a few other combinations and always have to force myself to stop eating so I don't puke from being so full.The wait staff kind of leaves you alone unless you look like you need something (in a good way, I'm never glancing around for the waiter in desperation for a refill or something equally insane).Personally I don't buy the ""crisped"" edge thing. It tastes burnt but hey, I eat the hell out of it. Everyone else likes that blackened crust (which they do on purpose, it's not a fluke or an excuse) thing but I could do without, personally.But, I know I'm getting it when I order and I keep going back so I've gotta be a little bit of a hypocrite because Pequod's is one of my go-to's."
"So Lou Malnati's is my spot for deep dish in the city but I was recently made aware that Pequod's was giving them a run for their money. On this latest adventure to Chicago I knew I had to give this spot a shot so as I landed at O'hare on a snowy Tuesday I placed an order for this pizza. I had a feeling the wait would be long and sure enough it was a 2 hour wait to get the pizza delivered. I made myself comfortable in the hotel and sure enough after the 2 hour wait, I received a ring to get the pizza. I had opted to go with the sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno deal. The pizza itself was massive and of course as soon as I held the box it felt like a million pounds. After a few bites into the pizza obviously the sauce was rich in flavor with the toppings adding tons of flavor making a great combination. They had the perfect sauce to topping ratio and man.... The CRUST be out of control. Yes the caramelized crust is really that good and worth the mention in itself. I was unable to finish the entire pizza but had to kill the crust of it all the way through. The sausage had a nice spice to it however my one item is that I like a bit more cheese to my pies... personal preference though. All this said leads to a solid deep dish pie but personally I still am partial to Lou's ""sheet of sausage"" and the way they pull their pies together. Still a solid joint and definitely worth a visit and my second favorite pizza joint in Chi Town."
I came here on my off day for the lunch special. The staff was super friendly and attentive. The pizza was super delicious as always! My favorite thick pizza in the city by far.
"Different kind of pizza. Two locations. Both divey and downscale. Fun, good pizza.Nothing bad here."
"My favorite pizza in Chicago! As a Chicagoan, born and raised, this place is the best in town! They only have 2 locations (one city and one burbs), making it even more desirable. The fact that they are exclusive to Chicago is what I love about this place! The Chicago location is a bit cozy so try to keep your party under 4. Otherwise getting a table is going to be 1. Very Hard! Like... incredibly, super duper hard!   2. You'll get to know your friend really really well.  The seats are kind of tight too, so hang your winter coats at the hallway coat hangers.  It'll save up the space for the very cozy booth seat for 4.Get the sausage pizza cause that's the best!  Their sausage is seasoned differently.  It's a little sweet, with a touch of anise.  And the crust of this pizza is the best!  The cheese is caramelized within the crust!  Unlike any other Chicago Pizza, the crust is thinner and chewier.  It's not too fluffy and not over dough-y.  The balance between crust, cheese, and filling is perfect!"
"I've loved Pequod's ever since I was little and my mom would bring home a pizza after work from their suburban location.  Now that I live close to Lincoln Park I try to go here every once in a while.  I won't get into an argument about the best deep dish in Chicago but just know that no discussion is complete without someone mentioning Pequod's.The place gets crowded so last time I was strategic and arrived just as the Hawks game was finishing.  This was perfect as everyone was leaving and tables were opening up left and right.  We opted to sit at the bar.  We were told the pizza would take like 40 minutes so we ordered mozzarella sticks.  The pizza came out about 20 minutes later so I was pretty bummed we ordered an app, which I wouldn't have done had I known the pizza would be out soon.  I guess that's a good upselling technique on their part but I didn't have enough room for delicious pizza.  Tell your rumbling tummy to shut up (or hold it over with beer) and wait for the pizza.  They also have a really good salad, if you're into that kind of thing."
This was a recommend by one of our friends that used to live in Chicago and I'm glad she told us about it as we wouldn't have otherwise checked it out.  Best deep dish we had in Chicago hands down!  The caramelized crust alone should win awards.  We came early so there weren't many people when we arrived but there was a line when we left so get there early.I'd come back to Chicago just to have another pizza from here.
The pan pizza is a staple and the thin crust isn't too far behind.The dining service has always been so-so (My party invested 3 hours one time due to waitstaff errors).Overall a great place.
I prefer Pequod's over Lou's. The one thing I will say is that eating it there out of the pan is much better than getting delivery or take out!
This is one of the best pizza places I've been to! The food is amazing and the service is pretty fast for a deep dish pizza place. I ordered the cheese fries and an Italian beef pizza. The fries were delicious pizza was surprisingly super great. This place is so underrated.
"Listen here, you must understand that this is a super busy and popular pizza joint that cooks deep dish pizzas (longer cook time) and you should proceed with caution and patience. This place is in no way a fine dining establishment so if you are looking for a wine list, a cloth napkin, and a server to be kissing your hand and feet as you enter, then this is not the place for you. This is a fun, busy, crowded and loud sports bar. The pan pizza is delicious, the apps are great, and there are a million TV's. It's so easy to see snotty and impatient customers around you not understanding why the pizza is taking so long? Or complaining about no wine list? Or that it's too loud, or too hot, or too crowded, or blah blah blah! Come on, take it as it is, have fun and enjoy the experience! Pequods will always have a place in my heart! Also, GO BLACKHAWKS!"
"The fam and I tried this fine pizza establishment while visiting in April. The pizza crust was thick and flavorful with a cheesy crunch. We (five of us) ordered a large and could not finish our pizza. They have a bunch of flat screen TV's on the walls so this would be a great place to have drinks, and food and enjoy a game. Our waitress was friendly and quick and we enjoyed our meal here."
"The Italian beef and sausage sub was just incredible. The deep dish was great too - kids loved it, but I'm a thin crust guy. Great ingredients, service, and atmosphere. A must for a Chicago visit."
"Hands down the best deep dish/ pan pizza in the city. Been here 4-5 times and every time I leave craving more pizza but so stuffed. Decent selection of local beers as well. Come here early or on a week night because there will almost always be a wait and if you call for delivery and phone is busy, they are open but will not take your order because they are so busy. Would give this place  10 stars if I could."
"It's frickin' good pizza.  I thought nothing could beat Lou Malnati's but I was wrong.  A co-worker suggested I try this spot and the pizza didn't disappoint.  I ordered one with extra cheese, basil, and sausage.  That frickin' sausage was to die for.  And the burnt crust at the end was really good.  I'm sorry I wasn't able to take a pic of it since my phone died.  We each at a slice and was so full we packed it and decided to give to a homeless person.  Was happy someone could make a meal out of it."
Came in a bit after midnight right after the Cubbies took game 1 of the NLCS - surprised that we did not have a wait. We were immediately seated and placed our order shortly thereafter. While it does take a bit of time to get your order out (I think anticipation makes the wait seem longer than it actually is) it was absolutely worth the wait!Can't wait to get back to Chicago soon and this will definitely be a place I would head back to everytime for deep dish.
"Yummy in my tummy! I have been coming here for take out for about a year now and I love it!  I usually order the same thing every time which is the deep dish pepperoni pizza with extra sauce! The sauce they use is rich, seasoned right and just plain delicious, so that's why I say extra sauce!!! The caramelized onion crust is what makes these pizza's perfect! The most recent visit was unforgettable! I ordered a pizza for pick up and I arrived early. So, I told the hostess I will be waiting in my car and I will come back in 10 minutes. As I was waiting she knocks on my car window to deliver me my pizza! Now that is worth 5 stars!! If you are looking for somewhere different for deep dish that isn't Lou or Gino east.. Come to the north side of Chicago and experience a different style of pizza with outstanding service."
This is Chicago's BEST deep dish pizza. Period. I've lived here for 28 years and nothing comes close. Definitely worth the often very long wait.
"We tried two deep dish places, Pequod's and Giordano's. We were a little disappointed by Giordano's, but Pequod's more than made up for it. They are totally two different pizzas. Giordano's is a layered pizza like a lasagna. Pequod's is like a traditional pizza with a thick crust. We tried the pepperoni and it was delicious! The caramelized crust is amazing.They also had an alcoholic root beer, which tasted exactly like root beer. The atmosphere was chill and didn't feel touristy like Giordano's. This is the Chicago deep dish to try."
"After a full day of drinking, walking, shopping, and doing touristy things, I was delirious by the time we arrived here for dinner so I can't accurately comment on anything prior to the food, but hey that's all that matters.From what I -do- remember, ambiance was nice (I felt cozy, and cozy is always a good thing for me), service was very friendly. The only poopoo was that our appetizer was forgotten until after our pizza came, but it was comp'd so I can't say shat. Will not beat a dead horse and rave about how DELICIOUSSS the pie was (burnt. crust. ohmygahd), except to say that pizza is forever ruined for me. Perhaps I'm biased because this is probably the only real pizza I've had, but for now I truly mean it. Would find any excuse to visit Chicago just so I can come back."
This is the best pizza around!  Beyond good!  Order the deep dish and you'll smile with every single bite!!!
"Well.  This is my second time here.  First with the wife and now with the boys.  I love the deep dish.  What a relaxed place and good environment.  Pizza takes 50 min.  But if you relax and have good people to chat with, it's all good."
"I'm not a big fan of deep dish, but I liked this spot! You can get individual sized pizza and they have lots of different toppings. Also loved the vibe of the place and they had lots of craft beer on draft to choose from! If you are having a hard time picking a deep dish Chicago style spot, this is the place to go!"
"Been coming here for years and despite the lack of parking and the long wait times, we keep coming back because the pizza is just that good!  This place is well run and employees are well trained by the manager who is a fixture here!  He runs a tight ship and leads by being a hands on perfectionist in an environment that could easily be chaotic and unmanageable!  Kudos to him."
My personal favorite deep dish in Chicago.
"1970's Chicago deep dish pizza in a 1980's atmosphere.    I remember places like this when I was a child growing up in Chicago.   Pequod's is one of the only deep dish pizza joints remaining that I consider to be authentic.PROS:1.   Possibly the very best example of classic Chicago deep dish pizza, evoking memories of my childhood 40 years ago.2.   It's delicious!3.   The menu is everything you'd expect.   It's almost as if a committee got together and spent a year coming up with the most prototypical pizza joint menu.    CONS:1.  Success hasn't ruined this place, but it sure is crowded.    If you are a bigger group and plan ahead, you can sometimes get your name in for a big table.    But if there is just two of you, expect a very long wait, and to get stuck in a claustrophobic table if you are unlucky.  2.   The location is really only good if you live in the area, or are visiting nearby Webster Place.    Nothing convenient about Clybourn Avenue.   (The good pizza is worth it though!)Visit this place during an off-peak time, and take a cheese-filled trip back to the Chicago of the Richard J. Daley era.    If you grew up here, you may find a bit of yourself in this place."
Just what you ever dreamed of for deep dish pizza. I had this delivered during my first try and was a bit disappointed but decided it was worth another shot. Have been to the restaurant twice now and am obsessed. I have ordered pepperoni and pepperoni/mushroom and both were phenomenal. A small is definitely big enough for two. Definitely call before OR order an appetizer because the pizzas take a bit to bake. Skip Lou's and Giordano's which is basically just a chain now and head to Pequods. You really won't be disappointed.
"Had my daughter's first birthday party here the other week. We had 30 adults and 10 kids. Party was upstairs in the private room in back which has a number of booths. Reserving the space was easy, just did it online and also got an email from Sean. I had a ton of questions and he replied quickly. We decided to order off the menu. We ordered baked mostaccioli with marinara sauce, pitches of soda and 12 pizzas. Ordered both the thin and the pan. All different kinds of toppings. Food came out when we requested it, service was great. Janet was the main server and she was so nice and attentive. Everyone loved the food and it was a good time. For the amount of food we ordered and the number of guests, the cost wasn't bad at all and food really did taste great. Thin was crispy, pan was nice and cheesy and had a nice caramelized crust!It's nice that the room doesn't have an amount of time you can have it for. We set up at 11am, party started at 1230. Food was out like I requested at 1pm and the party was over around 3:30 and we got our stuff together and left by 4. The room has 2 tvs so the guys were able to watch games. I would have a party here again, too bad there wasn't more parking in the area, but it's the city!"
The best pizza in Chicago. Worth the wait as the caramelized crust is to die for! We went at 11 AM Saturday morning and it was dead.
"Definitely an upgrade from Giordanos which I've been told no self-respecting Chicagoan would find himself or herself eating at (whoops for me). It was still the 45 minute wait for food, but the pizza quality was definitely noticeably better. The staff and service were great and the happy hour seems like an awesome nice touch. I can't really comment on the pizza other than it was tasty and better than the last Chicago pizza joint I was at.Space can be tight so coming at off hours can definitely help get you a table faster. You might also have to get creative with where you park (farther from the restaurant) iif you're an outta towner like me."
"I don't like deep dish pizza but this is definitely the tastiest I've had and, oh man, that crust! But we had a rather unfriendly waitress when we went so I have to subtract a star"
"I heard good things about this place. So we decided to order take out. We had 9 pickup orders, mostly personal pans and one was incorrect. I feel that you'd have to eat there for the full experience, but the lady through the phone order was quite short with me. The pizza was alright overall, but service was only satisfactory. Parking is abysmal in this area."
"I stopped here for lunch with a friend. The pizza was good and the price was right. I also like that it's BYOB! I ordered the lunch special, they make it fresh so it takes a little while but it is hot and delicious. I will be stopping again, Check it out if your in the area."
"Great pizza good environment, awesome beer. The waitress was nice, also the wait is a bit long but well worth it."
Excellent example of Chicago deep dish. Decent zucchini fries too. Great beer selection. Fun servers. If I have a complaint it is that it feelsLike it takes forever to get that pie you were dying for a half hour ago.
"This is my first review of Pequod's after two visits. This place is way up there in the Chicago deep dish hierarchy, and it is well deserved!First tip, this place gets really busy on the weekends. Time for a pizza can be 45-60 mins, even much later on in the evening. But it's worth it! The first time I went I got green pepper, sausage and pepperoni. It was delicious! The crust is really unique at Pequod's and the meat was SO good in this pizza. The second time I got just sausage, which I didn't like as well. I recommend getting multiple toppings, it just adds more flavor.This is a must visit place in Chicago. The pizza is outstanding and the building itself has a lot of character. I will definitely be going back again and again."
"Since moving out from Chicago, the two things I miss the most are Portillos and Pequods. Nothing else compares to the crust and sausage you get here."
"Let me start of by saying pizza is not one of my favorite foods, but I do consider myself a pizza connoisseur. I back this up by saying that I grew up with a father that loved pizza. Loves pizza so much. We frequently traveled to new pizza places always trying what's new and highly rated. So, with that being said, I have a strong opinion of ""good pizza"" - I do believe there is bad pizza. Pequod's is the opposite of bad, it's one of the best. The ingredients are super fresh and I would go as far to say the best sausage I have ever had on a pizza. Besides, Burt's Pizza, who was the guy that opened Pequod's and then went to a smaller pizza location in the burbs until recently, when sadly he passed away. The pizza was delicious, yes it is doughy, if that isn't your style, you may not enjoy this. Mike, my boyfriend, wanted to make sure I mentioned how great the crust is, in his words ""it's top-notch"" (I don't eat crusts). My only complaint is the garlic bread. How can you have such delicious pizza and such below average garlic bread.  Will we be back, absolutely. Pequod's definitely hits the spot and fills your pizza craving."
"The BEST deep dish Chi city has to offer.  I had to go gluten-free due to some health issues and losing this pains me the most. Sometimes I think the fatigue, bloating, and atomic farts might be worth cheating for!"
"Friendly greeting upon arrival, got there early enough that the wait time was only 15 minutes. Started with the cheese sticks, they were good and served their purpose, take the edge off while waiting for our pizza. Ordered a deep dish with sausage, onion and green pepper. It was very good, but it could have used more cheese. Overall it's a great pizza with a unique flavor."
"Last week was my first time eating deep dish pizza. There were so many options of pizza in Chicago. After reading so many reviews on whether it was better to eat at the tourist chain restaurants or driving out to Pequod's, we decided to listen to the locals.  We went on a Monday night and even though they didn't seem too busy we still had to wait a while to be sat. Keep in mind your pizza will take an additional hour to make after you have put your order in. I was with a group of 5 and we ordered the mozzarella sticks and the garlic cheese bread. The mozzarella sticks were nothing specials but the garlic cheese bread was so good and got us even more excited about the pizza we ordered.  Our pizza definitely did not disappoint! We were so stuffed. We ordered two large pizzas and we were not able to finish one! We did not get a chance to visit Giordanos or Lou malnati's, so I can't compare the pizza to theirs but we were definitely happy with our experience at Pequod's.I did take a star off for service, our waiter was very snappy. Took too long checking in on us and bringing us our drinks."
Always good!   A must try!! The best Carmelized pizza crust!  And if you can order ahead pizzas take at least 45 minutes.. But so worth it
"Not much more to add besides I loved the pizza. Personal size is the right amount for one hungry person. Also, well priced for the quality you get. About $10 for a personal size with two toppings. The caramelized edges are the cherry on top of a fine pizza."
"The crust has the consistency of a fluffy biscuit + caramelized, the tomato sauce is light and sweet (not salty) makes for an incredible deep dish pizza, not as cheesy and saucy as the others."
"I guess I'll be generous and give this place 4 stars instead of 3.  I rate it at 3.5  The pizza came out relatively quickly, or at least it seemed like it.  I wasn't a huge fan of the crust, but the top outside edge where the cheese carmelized was pretty tasty.I still love the deep dish pizza from home (Zachary's and Little Star in Berkeley) I always compare deep dish to them and they are still the best in my opinion.I was in Chicago for a 5 day trip and wanted to try out some of the best rated and highly recommended pizza places.I liked Lou Malnati's better than this place, but this was still a good option.The service was good.Sorry for the boring review..."
"I first saw of this place on man vs food and thought I have to try this place. I am glad I did!! This place can get packed but luckily my husband and I beat the lunch rush on a Saturday and got a table quickly. Our server told us their pizzas take about 45 minutes so we put our order in and started with mozzarella sticks. They were pretty average. Our pizza finally arrives and on my goodness, DELICIOUS! The pizza is definitely worth the wait. It is so thick and the dough has a sort of sweet flavor to it which is amazing. My only complaint is our server was beyond rude. We asked for clean plates after our appetizers and that really pissed her off. So much so I saw and heard her complaining about us to the bartender. She didn't ask how our food was during our meal but sure did perk up when it was time to drop the check. Other than her nasty attitude, the place is great. We will definitely be back our next trip to Chicago."
Great thin crust pizza!!!! Definitely worth a visit!!!
Maybe it's the crust... Maybe it's the insides of pure gooey heavenmaybe it's that I can put whatever the fuck I want inside (haha) what am I describing here?! A GOOD DAMN PIZZA I love deepdish. I know Giordano's is supposed to be the best or even Lou mal- but I really never like their deepdish the way I love Pequod's. They are good until you come here. And than a little light in your head turns on. And you realized you were settling for less! They have Chicago beer and Chicago pizza. And they keep this city girl happy :)
"Dear Pequod's, You are the sand to my beach, the peanut butter to my jelly, the wind beneath my wings. No but for real. Today was a great experience of many at this wondrous pizzeria. Although we waited almost thirty unbearable minutes to get seated, it was all worth it. Emily, our server, made us laugh! And not like, AT her. WITH HER. She was timely, well informed, and helpful. Our nervous, yet very cool busboy, James, was fantastic! It was his first day on the job, but he even remembered my boyfriend's request for blue cheese when I had forgotten. The appetizers came at just the right time and temperature. Our beers were brought cold and filled to the brim. The pizza was perfect! Caramelized crust, melty cheesy goodness, filled with the right amount of pepperoni and spinach. Just the way I like it! Pequod's is hands down the best place to bring a newbie for some Chicago style pizza. The atmosphere is great for every kind of person. Not too sporty, not too hipster, and not too yuppie. I recommend to all!"
"What a gem! I love the vibe in Pequods, the staff, & the food. Normally I am not a fan of their pizzas, but I do find that their pasta is AMAZING!! I love how this Chicago pizza place separates themselves from the others. It's definitely worth a stop!!"
"Great Pizza, use lots of napkins, as it can get messy. Burnt cheese crust is a nice touch"
"We had waited over an hour for seating our group of 7... they do not take resv, walk in only.  The pizza pies were incredible!! The only thing was they had recommended 3 pies for our party and we only finished 2.  Trust me ... we tried! It was very cheesy and tasty!!"
"As a Chicagoan, I'm embarrassed to admit that I just had my very first Pequod's experience last weekend. I can't believe I've been missing out on this much goodness for this long! Pequod's is a jam-packed pizza place, and for good reason! Their pizza is the ooey-gooeyist of all the Chicago style pizzas. Their famous carmelized crust is just as good as everyone says it will be, and their tomato sauce is hearty and flavorful! If you come to this location in the City, be prepared to wait! They do not take reservations but do have a priority list, which cuts down the wait time. We came in on a Sunday evening and waited about 40 minutes for a table, and again about 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. While the atmosphere is definitely divey, and while the place is jam-packed, it's worth it to experience the greatest of the Chicago deep dish options."
I love pizza!! I went to this place about twice the first time I was very happy because we were able to get seated right away and the food didn't take too long to come out. The second time I came to this place there were less people and for some reason our food took forever to come out and they tried charging us for water. I'm never a person to really point things out like this but I found it very distrubing that we didn't get the best service that night. But other than that the pizza was great.
"This pizza is delicious. Gooey, cheesy, perfect. The tomato sauce is sweet and bright, and the crust is buttery beyond belief. We added garlic, mushrooms, and spinach to the pizza, and split between four people (and still had leftovers!) We ordered a salad as an app, and the cheese came shaped like a whale (in honor of the restaurant's namesake). So cute!!"
"Not a huge deep dish fan, but if you like deep dish, this is the creme de la creme"
"Where the locals go and for good reason. The crust is bomb. Worth the wait, but if you go on an off day. We got seated right away!"
So Lou Malnati's was my favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago.... I thought no other deep dish could compete.... I WAS WRONG. Pequods.... wow.  I really don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said about their amazing pizza.  The sauce... the fresh toppings... that crust!!!I will happily drive from the suburbs to carryout from here.  I suggest you all do the same !
"Hands down my favorite pizza place in Chicago! Good brews, amazing caramelized crust and a fun environment! This is my go-to rec for people looking for the best in Chicago style cuisine. Period."
Real good pizza!!!! Went to the one in the north suburbs since the wait for the one in the city was to long.. worth the drive.
"Simply the best Chicago style pizza; not even close. You will walk out here with a belly full of bliss, delight and complete satisfaction. Wing are great, too."
"The best.As a south sider, to give that distinction to a north side joint, and for pan pizza is a big deal.  But it's the best in the City of Chicago.  You won't find anything close.  Lou Malnati's has a crust that can be compared, but it surely doesn't top Pequods, not by a long shot.  I literally go out of my way to stop in here, and we try to visit only once in a while to preserve the sense of novelty and make it a treat."
"Move over Lou Malnati's and Giordano's! This is the best pizza in Chicago, hands down. Technically it is considered ""pan pizza"", not deep dish, but that makes it all the more delicious! Imagine the Noble Roman's pan pizza you loved as a child, pumped up on steroids. That is Pequod's. I am really picky when it comes to cheese/sauce/crust ratio on my pizza and many places like Giordano's are very heavy on the cheese and don't put enough sauce on the pie. Pequod's has the perfect ratio with a perfect amount of sauce so you don't have to order extra. The sausage is packed full of delicious, fennel(ly?) flavor, but the real show stopper here is the crust. It's deliciously chewy and caramelized around the edges. The only downside to eating here is that the wait is often incredibly long, but it's definitely worth it."
"For my first ever visit to Chicago, I knew I had to try the deep dish pizza. As a NY native, I am a die hard fan of the thin crust. But when in Chicago...I had heard about the magnificence of Pequod's pies and came ready to eat (and wait). To our surprise, there were many seats available on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm! We got seated immediately and put in our order for a sausage pepperoni medium pie (6 slices for 3 people was more than enough).My first bite into the slice was the best. It was loaded with sauce & cheese and man, that deep bottom crust was so good. The only thing I wasn't blown away by was the caramelized outer crust that receives a lot of hype. I preferred eating the actual pie instead.I was impressed by myself that I was able to polish off 1.5 slices. Be careful trying to finish two; you may feel sick for a while. Otherwise, worth the visit and the future stomach aches!"
"Got take out, so I can't speak for inside of the restaurant. I had a friend visiting and he was on a mission to try different kinds of deep dish pizza. This place did not disappoint. The crust was sort of odd, more like bread, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't recommend their deep dish. We kept it pretty simple with giardiniera and sausage in one, with pepperoni and basil in the other. Very tasty!"
"If Pizza Snobs were celebrities I would be the Olsen Twins + the Kardashians.Pequod's is really, really good pizza.  I would also label it as a Chicago ""must try"" given its uniqueness.   For those new to Pequod's I think its important to point out:1) Their thick pizza is Pan, it is not Deep Dish.  Do not let anyone else tell you otherwise.  It is more of a Sicilian style thick crust pan.   2) The thin crust should be avoided.  It's not bad, it's just as good as others in the Chicago thin crust scene, and the crust is fairly thick and dull.  They don't apply the same burned cheese, mouth drooling, method that is used on the thick.3) The burnt cheese crust on the thick crust is awesome, and it just gives you that killer pizza ""I am going to devour you"" reaction aesthetically too.  Anyone who's had John's NYC will understand.4) Sausage and meat quality overall is fantastic.  Huge chunks, be prepared."
"If you're looking for authentic Chicago deep dish style pizza then look no more.  Being a guy with eyes bigger than his stomach I believed the medium wouldn't cut it, boy was I wrong! After eating two huge slices my stomach couldn't budge anymore. It was either throw up in the restroom to make room for more or just settle for a to go box. The vomiting choice would be a win/lose. You win more room in your stomach, yet you lose the delicious beauty that you just scarfed down. Looks like you're in a picks huh? I ended up taking half to go. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency, and the weird thing is they didn't have a microwave in the room. So I was forced to keep it inside the mini fridge and eat cold pizza when my digestive system passed through all the cheese and bread from the two slices before. One downfall is this cold pizza was not satisfying. There is just too much bread that it just hardens up and doesn't taste like a normal cold slice of pizza. Other than that, I was more than satisfied with this place and I'm sure you wonderful Yelpers will be too!"
It's the best deep dish the tourists don't know about it. I take all my visitors there.
"If you don't like their deep-dish pizza then deep-dish just isn't your thing. Plan ahead before going, because the place gets packed."
"Best deep dish in Chicago. If anyone is ever in from out of town this is my go to ""Chicago pizza"". The pizza does take 45 minutes at least to bake, so plan ahead. BUT you won't be disappointed with the delicious, cheesy, crispy, crust. Just writing this review is making me hungry for Pequod's"
"I thought it was quite good! Prepare to wait because it will be a while. From the moment we put our names in, to when we left it was about 2 1/2 hours. But that is to be expected from one of the best deep dish places in Chicago (so stop complaining, people). The only downside I thought was there was much more bread than cheese and toppings. But it was still tasty nevertheless! I highly recommend it."
"I can only speak for myself here, but if I'm given the opportunity to order a final meal on death row, it's gonna be from Pequod's. Their pizza is the gold standard for me (both the abundant pepperoni thin crust AND the caramelized pan pizza), and the salad is also an absolute treat. My favorite now, forever and always."
"Delicious crust on the outside, undercooked crust and veggies on the inside. I'm torn because the outside of the deep dish was so good (on the well done side with cornmeal), but the inside was meh. The yummy sauce was the tie-breaker, which is why Pequod's gets 4 stars instead of 3. That, and of the 3 Chicago style deep dish places I tried in my 3 day Chicago visit (yes, you read that correctly... I felt like a fatty for many moons after this visit).The service was kind of slow (it seemed like a busy night), but tvs with bad movies made up for it  :)"
Probably one of my favorite pizzerias in Chicago.  Came here on a later afternoon on Sunday and got seated quickly (table for 2).  Ordered a draft bud light and the garlic cheesy bread to start.  The cheesy bread was delicious and toasty with a little burnt cheese on top with an amazing marinara dipping sauce.For the pizza (now we're talking) we ordered a small (shareable between 2) deep dish topped with mushrooms and sausage. It was delicious with the perfect amount of burnt crust on the edges (known for that buttery and cheesy crust).  I think next time I might just order the pizza with just extra mushrooms.
"This isn't pizza, sorry Chicagoans.But for the casserole that this is, there's none better. Incredibly flavorful, delicious, perfectly cooked pie with great ingredients."
"I was in Chicago. I needed to get pizza - the real stuff. And I had just come off one of those: ""last night - late night ....had to order what I could, what was open.. last ditch effort unspeakable thin crusts that actually arrived to brick cold and bleh."" Thats a review to come later - Save the better for first.I did take out and called ahead from the train - I had to do a quick stop and grab on our way to the airport or I couldn't squeeze it in. I walked like miles off the train for this pizza and I don't go far out of my way (which at the time it seems like I was walking forever) but it was WORTH IT, amazing and the people were rocking.1) I don't need to even comment first on the pizza - because let it speak for itself. I liked the atmosphere. Cute, on the corner - walked in - we were greeted right away with smiles and ""What can we help you with!"" Awesome! They were so gracious and kind - basically knew it was me! We were thirsty and they got us cups to go, accommodated us for our road walking journey with a speedy check out. I was so grateful. I wanted to stay!2) Pizza smelled so good in that box. Good price too although I just got myself a small thick crust cheese (basic) but it was piping hot and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Rich and saucy. I was in heaven. I couldn't eat it all and that says miles for an appetite like mine. I was fortunate enough to pass it off to someone in passing that probably needed it more than me and they got to share in Pequod's Yumminess too.Thanks for your ""drive by"" hospitality, delicious pizza, affordable pricing, cool venue and lifesaver when I needed my Chicago Style Pizza. I will be back!"
"This is my favorite pizza joint. I can't say anything bad about this place. Everything is sooo perfect!! I never eat sausage but this sausage pizza is soooooo amazing. Even if we waited 1hr for a table, and then another 1 1/2 hr for the food. It was all worth it. It used to be a 6 stars in my eyes, now it's only a 5. Hopefully they will go back to being a 6. :-)"
"The thin crust pizza was so, so good. I'm still thinking about it and it was two weeks ago when I had it for the first time. I didn't know the background of this spot. We just saw it was close to the movie theater nearby and it had some good reviews. We ordered a thin crust with pepperoni and ground beef. Pizza heaven on a platter I tell ya! Let me just say I came away impressed. Crust is a nice golden thin crust and not fake thin or soggy. Cheese and meat were fresh and quality. From the outside by all appearances it's very much a neighborhood dive bar/dining spot that one may not guess has excellent thin crust pizza. But this spot had waaaay better thin crust than many bigger chains or touristy stops I've been to that tout good pizza. If you're a big pizza fan you definitely have to try this place. I haven't tried the deep dish so I can't speak for deep but the thin crust was all that."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! One of my favorite pizza places in the city!! I can't believe that other chains get more recognition because Pequod's is definitely one of the best!! Aside from the phenomenal pizza, the hot wings are also delicious!"
This will be my shortest yelp review ever...BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO - by a long shot.
"My first visit to Pequod's was a pleasant one.  Very unique and delicious crust on the deep dish pizza.  The mushrooms were incredibly fresh and the sausage was wonderful.My only complaint, i had a side salad and their Italian dressing left something to be desired.Will be going back again!"
Pequod's has amazing pizza. It might be the best in Chicago. Everyone should try this place at least once.
"There are certain milestones when it comes to becoming a ""real Chicagoan"" and not just a glossy-eyed transplant from Cleveland. For me, changing the alliance of deep dish establishments was one of them. I had heard about Pequod's from people at work, but I stuck to Pizzeria Due and Giordono's as my go-to places. Until I tried the glorious caramelized buttered crust of Pequod's that is...then it was game over! Is the wait horrible most time? Yes. Is it kind of a pricy option? Yeah. But is it worth it? Heck yes!  If you're dining in, the restaurant is small, poorly lit, has horrible parking, and no where to wait...but the bar next door is pretty chill. But Pequod's delivery range is pretty big so it's easy to skip the hassle, stay in sweatpants, and have it dropped off right at your doorstep. This is THE deep dish to get in Chicago, end of the debate."
"All i can say is that their pan pizza is great, but keep in mind that the bread will get absolutely soaked and soggy if you take it to go."
"My favorite Chicago deep dish. Lou's is a close second, but something about the crust at Pequod's is just utterly delicious. I love the meaty meat toppings, abundance of both delicious cheese and sauce, and did I mention that crust‽ I don't have much else to say as I haven't eaten in the restaurant and I always make the same order, but had to share my love for Pequod's."
Chicago's best deep dish. Sausage and pepper medium was delicious. I recommend not getting the large as the caramelized crust on the large is slightly overdone
"Pizza so delicious, you can overlook their awful pick up process.Seriously, it's that good."
"It isn't technically Chicago style pizza, but it is my absolute favorite pizza in Chicago. Try the ground beef pizza, it's not the most traditional topping but on their pan style it really works."
Went on a weekday for lunch and there was no wait. The pizza was good and I can see why Chicagoans are big fans of Pequod's. I think I still like the butter crust of Lou Malnati's better but that might just mean I need to give Pequod's another visit soon.
"This place has been hit or miss for me. The quality can really vary every time. The first time i went I wasn't a fan. The last time, it was absolutely delicious. So if you go once and don't like it, give it another try! Also better to go on off-peak hours when they're less busy."
"Yummiest deep dish in town. Period! Must go, must try."
"They have great service and great tasting pizza. The crust comes out burnt so if you don't like burnt crust you should tell them ahead of time. When you get there they tell you the wait is 1hr to 1.5hr, but don't be shocked they usually get a table for you sooner than they say."
"I've had Chicago pizza from many places and I feel like a pizza snob (Very high standards for pizza) in a way. I am not originally from Chicago (Kentucky originally) but lived there for many years and moved away. My favorite place was Petes on Western near Grace. My girlfriend, who is originally from New Hampshire, has never been to Chicago or had authentic Chicago pizza. Well, we decided to make a 7 hour trip from Kentucky to Chicago just for pizza. Absolutely no regrets at all. Service was great, food was fresh and hot, and staff was friendly and welcoming. I didn't expect anything else. Needless to say, we are fans of Pequod's and will be coming back. Next visit will be after we move. Such a great place and cannot express how happy we both will be moving back to Chicago. Thanks for a great night, Pequod's."
"Hmmm... where do I start?Basically if I ask you what your favorite deep dish pizza is and you give me a different answer other than PEQUODS, I'll either assume you've never tried Pequods and/or you're from out of town... or that you have bad taste. Loads of cheese and sauce and they don't skimp out on toppings. THAT CARMELIZED CRUUUUUST. Their wait times are anywhere from an hour to more. But can you blame them?? It's deep dish pizza made by the Pizza Gods. I always bring my out of town guests to eat Pequods and I've never heard them say anything like ""Hmmm, I've had better."" or ""It's just ok."" Their eyes light up as they take that first bite and tell me things like ""HOLY F*** THAT'S GOOD!"" or ""Don't talk to me for the next 30 minutes as I stuff my face with goodness."" (Now that I think about it, I really hope they're all being sincere.)I can't remember if I've ever had bad service there, but I think personally the pizza itself trumps and cancels out anything negative, so 5 stars!"
We are in such a huge hurry because we have to get our guest to the airport to catch a flight but we ate here before and frankly it is the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago hands down!!!The carmelized crust is so freaking delicious and somehow the bottom of the pizza stays really crispy too which is rare for a deep dish!I say you should make every effort to visit this pizza place on your next possible opportunity!
"Came here on a weekend getaway and we were prepared for the long wait so that didn't bother us! We got the wings as an appetizer while waiting for the pizza and they were DELICIOUS I totally recommend them. Since there are plenty reviews on here I will tell you ONE THING. Follow the advice of fellow yelpers and keep it simple when ordering... They pack the toppings on so no need to go crazy! My boyfriend didn't believe me when I told him yelp said to keep it to a couple toppings, he got a supreme style, and he wanted my plain pepperoni (but I didn't want to share)!"
"The pizza was great, very filling, and we were prepared for the wait based on tips here. Busy weekend night but we were given a booth & plenty of time - weren't rushed out the door. The only thing I found confusing is that the wait staff didn't have a set uniform - some were wearing black tshirts with the logo, others were wearing street clothes, and someone who seemed like a manager was wearing khakis. It made it seem like customers were rushing around, which I found confusing and distracting. The room got warm as the crowd grew."
"Pequods is my favorite pizza place in Chicago so much so that I always bring out of town guest here first because you can easily get Lou Malnati's or Giordanos but noting compares to the caramelized crust and indulgence that is Pequods.For people that are uninitiated to Chicago pizza, I always say that you must try a couple of places and compare it to other Pan/Deep Dish places. You will be unsatisfied if you compare Pequods to other pizza you've had because of the difference in the category. Also, be careful reading any reads on Yelp -- always see where they're from! Most people giving low reviews to Pequods are out of towners and have not had Pequods or any deep dish pizza place more than once. If you compare it on it's merit to other Pizza, you'll be disappointed because there is no proper comparison (apples to oranges, both are fruit, but quite different.)  The one thing that Pequods has over it's closely competitor is the amazing crust. It's caramelized and burnt looking but it's toppings are no joke. Equipped with a fork and knife, it's a difficult proposition to eat more than a couple of slices. Generally, a large can feed a group of five or more!My only advice is to actually request more sauce. On lazy days, the pizza may come out too dry and a dry pizza is no good. More sauce gives it more of a hearty tomato taste that really balances out the superior Pequods crust.  Otherwise, pick your favorite toppings (Note: pepperoncini is not pepperonis, don't learn the hard way). Overall, the place is good for groups EXCEPT on any game day which will inflate your wait for both the pizza and a table. I wouldn't necessarily suggest bringing a family here either especially with younger kids or older adults because it has a very bar-y feel to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's a great place for friends (esp. those visiting from out of town to convert to Chicago pizza believers)."
It's good. There are many things that could have been better - but the ingredients were good. Overall 7/10. Service was meh - lots of upselling.
"Love this place! Try not to eat this kind of food often, but everytime is a meal well planned. Great staff everyone was thoughtful and carried the place Well. Gold i call it golden. This joint right here, Yummy for sure! Dont forget to ask Sally when you get there to Upgrade the special you will leave insatisfaction mode."
"I'm not much of a deep dish pizza guy. Like Jon Stewart once said, I see it as more tomato soup in a bread bowl than an actual slice of pizza, but when in Rome (er, Chicago), why not indulge as the locals do?Pequod's was suggested by a friend who has awful tattoos, but a pretty solid taste in food and he didn't steer us wrong. A small deep dish was more than enough for two people and it was quite affordable as well (I believe it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $12). The best part were the burnt ends of the crust, and as someone who doesn't always end up eating the crust, this was a nice surprise at the end of the tomato saucy rainbow.The place itself is a bit of a dive and the perfect setting for a quick bite before a Cubs game. If I lived in town, chances are this would be my go to spot when craving a Chicago style pie (or ""a f**king casserole"" as Mr. Stewart calls it)."
"Golden Carmelized deep-dish pizza!  Need I say more?  The timely waitress returns to make sure food IS good.  The manager circles the tables to ensure the service is spot on.  The atmosphere is cool and clean, pepperoni is plentiful, slices are thick, and the Coca-Cola classic is bubbly.  No Kitchen Nightmares here.  Nicely done!"
"I have been enjoying and recommending Pequod's Pizza ever since my first taste but my recent customer service experience set my opinion above and beyond what it was before (I apologize in advance, this will be detailed).My parents were visiting for dinner so I ordered a pizza for pick-up. When I arrived to get the order, the restaurant was swamped with at least 20 people waiting outside for their tables and even more waiting for their to go orders inside. A woman also picking up a pizza had an issue with her order but I didn't give it much thought until I brought my pizza home. After digging in, I realized there was a number of things wrong with the order and I sent a Facebook message to let the management know since something seemed to be happening in the kitchen causing orders to come out incorrect.I received a response that night offering to send a gift card, which wasn't at all necessary, but certainly appreciated. I received the gift card two days later and just went to enjoy a Friday night out for dinner. Upon arrival, we were told the wait was significant so they recommended we wait at a new bar two doors down where a receipt for our purchase there would give us a discount at Pequod's. The wait was much shorter than anticipated and we were able to place our order immediately once seated. The beer was exactly what we wanted on this steamy evening, the pizza was perfect and our Friday night was everything I wanted!Although the initial order was wrong when my parents were visiting, the customer service I received exceeded my expectations. The suggestion to wait at the bar next door, who's atmosphere was exactly what we wanted,  was everything we were looking for on a Friday night. I already was a loyal customer, but this experience was so much more than I ever expected that there's no doubt I'll go anywhere else for pizza, beer and Blackhawks games. Pequod's, thank you, for this experience. Businesses can take a note from you on how to ensure lifelong customers!"
"Absolutely love this place. I'm a huge Lou Malnatis fan and this is my new favorite. Now let's be clear, Pequods is not deep dish. It's Pan. So everyone comparing it to deep dish is way off! Anyways the crust is caramelized cheese and it's the best part! If your in the neighborhood check it out!!"
"I came to meet some friends here that live in Chicago, they suggested this place and wow did it live up to there words. I'm from nyc so we do flat pizza and the last time I was in Chicago I had giodanos and its was not what I thought. But lord this place the pizza was amazing! It just was to good and I loved it."
"As much as I enjoy the Malnati's ""Chicago"" butter crusted  deep dish, the ""za"" at Pequod's is my favorite in Chicago. Thick cheesy deep dish pizza piled high with the toppings of your choice make this my favorite place for dine in pizza. The pizza is best eaten on site as it does not travel as well as Malnati's pizza likely secondary to the many vegetable toppings we had selected. We have eaten in several times and it was always excellent but took the same pizza to go and ate it thirty mins later and it had become fairly soggy so in other words it did not travel well. It frequently has a line/wait so be prepared especially on ball game days. In summary, if you want the best pizza and have the time to wait 15-45 mins to be seated then this is he place to go."
"Great pizza, fun and lively atmosphere and good service. Got a table right away, but had to wait a bit for the pizza (but they tell you that right up front, so you are prepared)."
"This is our go to place for Chicago deep dish pizza. It is extremely hard to get into on the weekends. We have tried twice and been told an hour to an hour and half wait. Add in the wait to cook your pizza, and you're looking at 2-1/2 hour wait to get to fed. My advice if you intent on Pequods for a weekend night, don't go hungry! This last time we went on a Tuesday. A 10-15 minute wait was acceptable. We actually got seated in 5 minutes! Pizza was delicious as usual. Their sauce is great fresh, sweet tomatoes. The salad was disappointing. Lou Malanatis has better salads, they use romaine lettuce and their dressing is fresh, made in house. Our Cesar salad was made with leaf lettuce and the dressing was overly thick and salty. We ordered beer but unfortunately they were out of our preferred Allgash. Disappointing."
"As a Chicagoan, I love all pizza. Thin, thick, stuffed, pan, deep dish, bagel bites, pizza for breakfast, cold pizza straight from the fridge. Pequod's does live up to the hype. I wouldn't say it's the best pizza, mostly because I don't have a favorite. I love all sorts of pizza, remember? Don't come here starving to death because you will most likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for a table. And then after you order a pan pizza, you'll have to wait another 20+ minutes. And for that reason, we ordered mozzarella sticks so we could have something to munch on. Nothing amazing with the mozzarella sticks and, unfortunately, ours were only slightly warm, which means the cheese was not ooey gooey.. boo. Anyway, the pan pizza is HEAVY. I would say a small 10"" pan pizza is enough for two people if you don't want leftovers. In my opinion, the more toppings, the better! So we usually get pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom. Their pan crust reminds me almost of thick focaccia bread doused in butter and cheese and baked until a nice, crispy outer crust is formed. It's definitely a delicious pizza straight out of the oven, however, I don't recommend take out since the pan pizza can get a bit soggy."
"Best pizza in Chicago- it's as simple as that. Definitely expect a line, but definitely know that the wait will be well worth it in the end. If you're ordering delivery, it's gonna take a GRIP, but again- worth the wait."
"I was in Chicago last weekend and on Sunday night me and my buddy wanted to gorge on some good Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I had tasted deep dish before, and knew what to expect.My buddy and I were bar hopping, and every bartender we spoke to told us to visit Pequod's Pizzeria for the best experience. As we were in downtown, we had to Uber it to this location, and it was less than a ten minute ride. It was late on Sunday night, so luckily for us the place was not totally packed although they only had a few tables where we could seat ourselves. Since we are vegetarians and were only two people, we ordered the ten inch, and added veggies (onions, tomatoes etc) to the basic pizza. The waitress told us it would take about 30 minutes to get ready, and we knew that going in. We asked her if we could go next door to Drinking Bird for a quick cocktail (Our bartender friends had also recommended we visit this bar). To our surprise, our waitress had no issues with us leaving the place for 30 minutes, and she did not ask us for a card or pre payment. That was awesome!Upon our arrival, our pizza was at our table and it looked delicious. Needless to say, it tasted amazing and the crust was so chewy and did not crumble.I cannot vouch for the meat laden pizzas, but ours was top notch.Will make it a point to visit this joint when I am in Chicago next."
"Pequod's gets my vote for best Chicago deep dish.The cheese-to-sauce ratio is the golden ratio of pizza, and Pequod's is perfect. While some local deep dish places tend to go lighter on the sauce, Pequod's layers it on (but not excessively). Their sauce is full of seasonings and rich tomato flavor.As important is the crispy burnt cheese crust. Deep dish pizza tends to get a bit soggy, so the cheese crisped around the edges adds a nice crunch. And who doesn't love nearly-burnt cheese on their pizza?The individual (7"") size is enough to satisfy two moderate appetites, but if you're hungry, you can probably polish off one solo. And with inexpensive delivery and no delivery minimum, Pequod's makes it easy to do so."
"Hard to believe that I've been to Pequod's as much as I have and never bothered to write a review until now.  Let me start by saying I like this place so much that we held our rehearsal dinner here.  They have a back room upstairs that you can rent out that holds about 50 people, and I want to say they charged $40 per person for all you can eat and drink (including draft beer and I think house wine).  That would have been around May 2013, so not sure how pricing is now.I've had most if not all of the ""famous"" places around Chicago, and nothing will ever beat Pequod's for me.  I can't even tell you how many friends over the years I've turned on to this place.  Some are local and have since made it their staple place, and some are distant and now make this a priority stop when passing through Chicago.  I'll specifically never understand how anyone can like Lou Malnati's ""wheel of sausage"" pizza better than this.Regarding the pizza, the crust is amazing.  I know that it may not be ""traditional"" deep dish, but it's thick as hell and impossible to eat more than two slices, so it's deep dish to me.  When I eat the crust on most deep dish, it seems like I'm just eating a lot of cooked bread.  Pequod's caramelizes the crust, and most lovers would agree it's the highlight.  The sauce is also delicious, as well as the toppings.  My personal favorite pie is pepperoni, Canadian bacon, & giardiniera.  If you like spicy, the giardiniera is absolutely delicious (most of my non-Chicago friends don't even know that's a thing).Word to the wise, if you go at a time when most places are crowded, be prepared to wait a while to be seated, and to receive your food if you order deep dish (since it takes longer obviously).  This is Chicago after all, and any good restaurant is slammed when you'd expect it to be.  However, you can call ahead to make reservations, and last time I was there they accommodated a party of 14 for us on a Saturday night no problem, but I did call weeks in advance.  Also, a trick is that if you know what you want to order, you can place your order while you wait, so that once you are seated, your food comes out much faster than if they take your order at that point.Regarding the service, we've had some wait staff that was better/worse than others.  It's never been amazing and never been terrible, so we've never really thought much about it.  It's never gotten in the way of the goal, which is devouring as much of their pizza as possible before face planting."
The pizza here is awesome!!! A bunch of us went after work and had a great time.  The service was really good and our server was very patient with us.
"Great service - really friendly! I brought 17 co-workers here on Friday for lunch and they were so accommodating! I called an hour beforehand and before we got there, they had set-up a table and small, semi-private area for us!The food was incredible - the personal pans, appetizers and salads were all a hit!"
"Recommended to me as the only deep dish Chicagoans actually eat and can see why. The caramelized crust lives up to all the rave reviews, tomato sauce is not too sweet and cheese is just enough. Put your name down, grab a buzzer and have a cocktail next door at Drinking Bird."
"The pizza was great and salad wasn't bad for what I expected. They said the pan pizza would take 50 mins.., but probably just wanted us to order apps. It came out in less than 30."
"My favorite pizza in the world. I am not usually a thick pizza fan, buy I am a true pizza lover. This is the best I have ever had. The dough is awesome. Sauce slightly sweet. Topping are quality. We always get a pan pizza with mushroom and giardinera. This place is basically a local bar with the best pizza in the world."
I've been going to/ordering from Pequod's for years....dating back to when Blackhawks home games weren't televised.  This was the only place in town that had NHL Center Ice and a chance to watch a home game.  Definitely top 3 best pizzas in Chicago too.
Dining in is a automatic 5 stars.  Delivery I can only give 3 stars. The pizza dining in is the best in the city. I have never been let down.
"Pequod's is freaking awesome.My husband and I recently did a ""Tour de Deep Dish,"" and went to all the big deep dish joints in Chicago over a 2 week time course.Here's my side-by-side comparison:5. Uno's: Medium-density crust. Heavy on the cheese, medium on the sauce. Zesty sauce. Solid salads.4. Giordano's: The most well-rounded (potentially) of the deep dishes. Medium-density crust. Heavy on the cheese, light on the sauce. Sweet sauce. Great salads--would go light on the dressing.3. Lou Malnati's: High-density crust, probably the most densely infused with butter. Hard and crispy. Heavy on the cheese, medium on the sauce. Sweet sauce. Solid salads.2. Pequod's: Light-density, airy crust (as airy as deep dish goes haha). Added bonus (!) acclaimed halo of cheese surrounding the crust. Medium on the cheese, heavy on the sauce. Sweet, savory sauce. Average salads; definitely more options for greens at the other deep dish venues. 1. Gino's east: Medium-density FLAKY, buttery crust. Heavy on the cheese AND sauce. Sweet, zesty sauce. Awesome salads.Definitely love Pequod's, and it would totally be my fave if the Gino's combo didn't strike my fancy so fittingly. I think the attraction in Pequod's is that they dare to be different. Most deep dish places are just a variation on the theme. Pequod's really does have a distinct deep dish that dances to the beat of its own hip drum."
Make sure to ask for your pizza to be well done and have some extra cheese on it.Top 5 pizza spot in Chicago.
"If you love deep dish and are a little tired of the typical Giordano's (blech), Gino's East, or Lou Malnati's, Pequod's will delight.  They serve their pizza's a little more well done, so it is almost crispy crust and burnt edge pepperoni.  I highly recommend the pepperoni!!"
"I've been to both locations (the OG is in Morton Grove) It's not as good as the Original according to my husband, but I love both locations. Best pan pizza in Chicago in my eyes."
I love the flavorful sauce and the crust! Delicious hand packed sausage! So good! One of my all times favorites in Chicago!
"My first time in Chicago and let me just say, the pizza lived up to the hype. Ate here before flying out and the deep dish pizza was amazing. We had 2, one with pepperoni, peppers and garlic, and the other with sausage, peppers and mushrooms.The pepperoni pizza was my favorite, simply because of the fresh garlic and my lack of enthusiasm for anything mushroom, but the sausage was fresh and delicious.The staff was friendly and professional.If you're in the Chicago area and want some fresh, deep dish pizza this is the place to go!"
"Born and raised in Chicago, and this is one of my favorite pizza places. I love the caramelized cheese crust. Great beer selection. Salads and other items on the menu are tasty as well. There's often a wait, but they communicate about it well. Highly recommended!"
Best pizza in town. Get the pan. The caramelized crust is magical. #2 Geno's. Everything else is just doughy.
I love Pequod's. It's one of the first stops on my taste of Chicago tour when I have friends or family visiting. They are always swamped so I make sure to go early or on weekdays to avoid the ensuing (yet justified) madness. I recommend to start with and order of wings before you move on the the sausage/pepperoni pan pizza. The leftovers from Pequod's are the best! The pan pizza holds up for delivery but just takes a bit of time to show up. Well worth the wait either way..
"My boyfriend and I made a pact: Go to Pequod's.  Eat pizza.  Get massive food coma.  Feel regret. Mission accomplished.  Being a native of SoCal and traveling to Chicago with my main squeeze, Chicago pan pizza was all we had in our minds. Where do I begin?  I immediately liked the dive-y vibe once I stepped through door.  We started off with their popular cheesy garlic bread, which was pretty flipping awesome.  I was surprised how well the bread held up with the cheese; the bread was still crunchy and paired oh-so-well with the melty, chewy cheesy.  It was a textural play in my mouth. Get it!The piece de resistance:  We ordered a LARGE (we were feeling adventurous) pan pizza with pepperoni and basil.  Dark.  Divey ambience. Friendly servers.  Expect a 40-50 min wait for pizza to cook. Prepare yourself for carb heaven."
I'm still thinking about the pizza from here even though I'm back in LA! I'm really glad my cousin took me here to show me what some REAL Chicago deep dish is all about. And man was I not ready for this. Deep is an understatement. Knife and fork caliber pizza because that's the only way to handle it. And don't forget pitchers of beer to go along with it. This place had a great locals atmosphere and vibe and it's no mistake that they are a total Blackhawks establishment all the way. Loud and wild bar like feel but still good for the family. Be prepared to wait for a table at peak hours. But no worries you can put your name down and have a drink while you kill some time;)
"PEQUOD'S HAS THE BEST CHICAGO-STYLE PIZZA IN CHICAGO AND I WILL FIGHT YOU IF YOU DISAGREEPepperoni + onion + green pepper is the go-to.  Keep it simple, stupid.Side note: their Italian salad dressing is da bomb.  I'm sure it's from a bottle or whatever but screw you, I would drink that shit.Pro-tip: go to the Drinkingbird next door afterwards for some good (and cheap) after-dinner craft cocktails"
Best pizza ever!  The cast iron pan it is baked in makes all the difference in the world!  Never disappoints
"This Pizzeria is on my top 3 places to get a slice of pizzzza! I still haven't many places that I need to check out but this place is the one place I like to take girls out to dinner who are pizza lovers. I do recommend it to some folks also, because, well its delicious lolAnyways, the best part for me is that the crust looks burn but its actually especially delicious"
"Nothing like it in the city!  Delicious :)  I usually get pineapple as an extra, and it never disappoints.  You won't break the bank here, either. It's a special treat for a pick up to bring home, too."
"A true Chicago institution, been going to Pequod's since late 90's and they have never disappointed. Simply delicious pizza and good value. Great vibe, always look forward to a slice whenever I am in the neighborhood."
"My fellow New Yorkers know - Chicago deep-dish pizza ain't pizza. The dense vessel of bread augmented with a vertical growth of irrelevant toppings and something like an inch of cheese is more like pie, or bad lasagna... or some other obscene thing characterized by gross excessiveness rather than a relationship to that majestic food form we call pizza.That said, Pequod's serves up a damn delicious deep dish ""pizza"" (yes, you still need a fork to eat it).The difference between Pequod's and the other, very overrated Chicago deep-dish heavyweights is that Pequod's lines the cast-iron pan with cheese before baking the pizza. The result is a beautifully blackened edge of, yep, fried cheese - that holds the pizza together instead of becoming soggy after a minute and breaking off from the rest of the pie. The crust is also slightly thinner than the refined carb parties of Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, both of whom have totally mediocre deep-dish due to a dry monster crust of solid bread and an avalanche of cheese and too-sweet sauce that slides off the second you lift your slice out of the pan.Our medium ""pan pizza"" (as they call it) with jalapenos and mushrooms cost $20 and was ready for pickup in 30 minutes. The restaurant looks like a regular old Chicago bar: low-key, dirty worn wooden floors, maybe you'd see lots of daisy dukes if it had been warm enough. It was totally empty on a Wednesday at 10:30pm, though they're open conveniently til 2am. Call ahead to place an order even if eating in, since the pizza takes a half hour to cook either way.The first deep dish I've actually liked as food and not spectacle! Mmm."
"The best deep dish, hands down!I have tried Giardinos, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's and this is my personal favorite.Be prepared to wait, as this place is very popular."
"I work in the area and I always see the lines of people waiting. My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on a Saturday, we didn't have to wait and were seated right away. Staff was friendly, attentive and awesome. The pizza was to die for!!!! We found our new favorite pizza place."
"Hmmm delicious... the crunchy cheese on the edge of the crust is so good. It is a bit outside of the more common and touristy areas and I am glad we ventured out here. Had Lou Malnati's last time, which I very much enjoyed, but I think Pequod's is even better. Lunch special is a really good deal too!"
My fav deep dish pizza in Chicago. Less hassle than the others in terms of getting a seat. Their crust is the best. Always reliable
Loved the deep dish pizza with its caramelised crust.. Sauce is really good. Would definitely recommend!Service could be more attentive though.
"Every time I come here, I have to get their pan pizza (they say it's deep dish, but I don't really consider it deep dish?). Anyway, their pizza is amaaaaaaaaaaaazing. Their ingredients are so fresh and I LOVE the crust (and I NEVER eat pizza crust). Good beer on tap, and the server checks in regularly. :)"
"Very chill place to go and sit down, get a pitcher  beer, and a pizza and you will be the happiest person ever. I've also gotten delivery and never been let down.Thin crust is solid, but if you are venturing Pequods, get the deep dish. It is possibly the greatest in the city of Chicago, right up there with lou's and art of pizza. The caramelized crust is something to tell your mother about (i know i told her bout it last night)."
"By far the best pizza in Chicago. The cast iron baked pan crust is so ridiculously good I have dreams about it. The place does get really busy during popular hours and the service starts to slow, but the pizza is well worth the wait. Definitely a must try if you haven't already."
This was my 2nd time dining in. Service was great staff is very polite. It was my surprise for my Hubby. It was our 10year anniversary. I was able to enjoy the thin crust pizza. They said it would be able 45 minute to wait on the pizza to come out. They served us in 20 minutes. We were pleased.
Its a bit of a throw down with Chicago deep dish between Pequods and Lou's Personally we feel that Pequods has tastier and more plentiful toppings. As some folks may have seen in our other posts we are into thin crust better. However when we get the chance we certainly try to frequent Pequods.
Best deep dish in Chicago! Once you order it's a bit of a wait to receive your food but it's definitely worth it! They make their pizza fresh and cook the crust to the perfect level of crisp.
Awesome pizza! Ordered a large sausage and pepperoni pie. Huge for two people. The beer on draft is really good. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Chicago!
"Meh.  The pizza was good but not exceptional. I know this pizzeria is popular -- place was hopping on a weekday afternoon -- but for both atmosphere and pizza, it rates a B- in my book."
Hands down my favorite pizza in Chicago. It's a pan pizza with the mozzarella caramelized on the outside to form a crust. The pepperoni is good and crispy at the edges.
"Heard many reviews and comments about this place and with chicago having many pizza places i figured i needed to compare lou's.... soo that being said i think this place was amazing, not a long wait at all and definitely go again. Galric cheest bread was amazing and the atmosphere was pretty cool but busy."
The pizza here is excellent. It's as good as Lou Malnati's just different. We waited a very long time to get in. By the time the pizza came we were starving even though we ordered an appetizer and a salad. I wish it wasn't such a long wait. I understand that pizza takes time to cook.
"The pizza is still rockstar and continues to be.  Can't tell you how many tourists I've brought here over the years and they've been wow'ed.  The pan pizza is that effing awesome.  It is.  If Pequod's & Yelp sold marketing information about Yelpers to doctors, I'd be screwed.  I think the most times I've been to this location in one year would be over thirty for sure.  When entertaining guests that bitch and moan about a Chicago pie, if you must bring them here, the reacharound is to get a thin crust for them.  It's not bad, it's middle ground.  Personally I never order it.  Thin crust is also available by the slice.For all the naysayers that say ""what's the deal, why the long wait for blah blah blah"" Go to Pizza hut, there's no wait there.  For realz.Two awesome details about Pequod's.  They are open till 2 am six days a week and midnight on Sunday.  So there are plenty of times you can get in here and get a pie.  After the bars or a late night of happy hours, its a great way to end a good evening.  Second detail, their lunch special.  They've offered it forever.  Personal pan with one  topping and a soda or beer for $4.95.  That is a deal that cannot be beaten at any pizza joint, it's perfect.  At times when I'm dining with people with too many topping requests, I'll order an individual and I'll be content.  I think a Pequod's pie is best with minimal toppings, three max depending on what's ordered.Service wise.. it's not that it's hit or miss.  Just depends on the night.  I think the waitresses can be overworked because it gets hella busy.  There's the main floor and then there is also a second floor for much more seating.  I keep hearing about a beer garden but I've never seen it or forget to ask.  As a norm I always place my pizza order ahead of time.  It's almost ready to be served when I arrive and it's piping hot.I know once a few friends see this review I may get a text to join for some awesome Za over the weekend.  If you use a smart phone and ""check in"" to places, you can often see a popup mentioning other Yelp users being here as well.  At least in my experiences."
"I just don't really understand why people think this is the best pizza in the city. It's good, but not oh my gawwd so ahmazingg good, that I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Always expect to wait a long time to get in."
"I've never had legitimate Chicago deep dish until this past weekend. Also, I've never been to Lou Malnati's so I can't compare the two. I just know that Pequod's was really, REALLY good.We had reservations at 6:30pm. Their version of ""reservations"" is basically priority seating, you still have to wait a bit depending on how many people are there. I'd recommend waiting outside (if it's not too chilly) because it's quite crowded inside around dinner time and you can get bonked on the head or jabbed in the back with some pizza pans. Also while you're waiting, you can start looking at the menu and deciding what you want. You can even order before you sit down! Something I wish we had known..We sat down and ordered a pitcher of Goose Island 312. Great local beer, btw. The three of us also ordered cheesy garlic bread for starters. We were reluctant since we knew there would be a lot of carbs to be consumed with our deep dish, but went for it anyways. It was one of the best decisions ever.A common mistake that people make is forgetting this is deep dish. Usually it would be perfectly fine for 3 people to get a large 14"" NY style pizza, but since this was Chicago style, we downsized to a medium 10"" (sausage, mushroom, onion) and still struggled to finish. There were 6 slices and we all struggled finishing the last one. I think I left half of it on my plate and ended up picking at the toppings because I could not physically fit any more food in my stomach. I wanted to though. It was sooooo good, the crust and bottom were buttery and crispy, the middle was soft and doughy. There was just enough sauce and a good amount of toppings. I couldn't ask for a better first deep dish experience!"
Hands down best deep dish in Chicago. Don't bother eating there because you will wait forever. Takeout is a must. Once you've had this you won't go back for any other deep dish. That is all.
"Pequods pizza is on my top 3 list for deep dish in Chicago. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars to me is the typical wait for a table as well as pizza, which for me has ranged from 1.5-2.5 hours. Understandably deep dish pizza takes a while to make but this is longer than other places I have been.The pizza itself is stupendous and the garlic bread for an appetizer is bomb!"
Another SERIOUSLY good pizza place in chicago.  Im getting fatter as i write this review.  Jeez  i cant say enough good stuff   SLOW delivery   but i mean.... genious pizza takes time to create.  IM OBSESSED    thank you for being a friend Pequod's Pizza
"The question I imagine everyone asks is 'How does the deep dish compare to the other establishments?'Really well, I'm not a deep dish connoisseur, but of the ones I've had, this one rates the best. For me it was the crust. It was still crispy and great with all the gooey cheese. Whenever we visit Chicago and are craving deep dish- we'll come here first :)"
"Pequod's is THE BEST pizza in Chicago. Seriously close off your ears and yell very loudly at anyone who tells you differently, especially if it's your friend from Indiana who wants to go to Uno's or Lou's..... Get new friends.Pizza is like french fries, it's hard to have ""a bad pizza"" but Pequod's takes it to the next level. The toppings are premium (try their homemade Italian sausage), the sauce delish and oh my: the crust. It's doughy AND crispy. Mind blown.Sure, there are other excellent pizza places in Chicago, and you should try them all. And that folks is why Chicago is awesome."
We come here for birthdays. My kids make sure of that. We're always satsified.
"I haven't had Lou Manalti's, but I figured I would give this place a try first because it is harder to get to for me. Disclaimer: I don't usually like deep dish pizza, and if I had a choice, I would go for NY style any day.This deep dish was different than those I had before. There's actually very little tomato sauce and the toppings lie on top (compared to ones I've had before which were filled with a tomato sauce / topping mixture).What I really like is the caramelized cheese edges, so crispy! I also like that despite all the wet toppings on top, the bread on the bottom below the cheese remained completely dry! Not soggy at all! I think that's a huge feat to accomplish. For these two things alone, I give this place 4 stars. Also, the slices are huge! I shared a small pizza ( 4 slices) with one other person, and was pretty satisfied after just 1 slice. I continued to stuff my face, and ate another 1/2 of a slice. Yum!"
"One of the best pizza places in the city for deep dish or pan pizza. Make sure to bring plenty of friends because, speaking from personal experience, there is no way just two people could eat one of their medium sized pan pizzas. It is usually quite crowded on weekends or game nights so be prepared to wait a bit, but the wait will most definitely be worth it."
"Not many places in my opinion should get 5-stars but this place is a staple of mine. Now that I do not live in Chicago ALL deep dish pizza I try are automatically compared to my Pequad's Pizzeria. My go to Pizza toppings include ground beef and spinach or simply a cheese!  Top that off with your favorite drink and get ready to dive in.Be prepared to wait if you are trying to go on a Friday or Saturday night as this place has set a reputation for some of the best pizza in all Chicago. More good can be said but ""if you don't know, now you know"" - B.I.G"
better than Giordanos!!yummy deep dish pizza with caramel crust and we ordered wings as well as raviolli which were equally yummy! :D
"As a New Yorker I have a very specific idea of pizza. However, whenever I want deep dish style of ""pizza"", I go to Chicago to find the best pie. I've had Giordanos and Ginos but I absolutely prefer the way the Pequod's cooks theirs. The crust is dark and caramelized and the whole pie is cooked so well. The sauce is tasty and the base crust is the right crunch. The service is great and the waiters are personable, despite being so busy."
"Get deep dish pizza with pepperoni and hot giardinera. This pizza warrants 5+ stars, hands down. Skip the apps, salads, and thin crust altogether. Don't expect much from the service or decor. Just get this pizza in your mouth now!"
"So far this is the best deepdish I had in town. Everyone talks about the baked cheese on the crust and there's a reason! The cheese on this was very generous, think giordanos, while the ingredients were fresh. What really caught me was the tomato sauce, they do it right. Good amount of tangy sweet. The place itself was dimly lit, and we couldn't find great seats, it was pretty crowded. But deep dish, after here, has become a new thing for me!"
"Best deep dish in Chicago, no doubt. My only complaint is that the pies can sometimes be a little inconsistent and on occasion the cheese-to-bread ratio gets out of whack. I generally solve that by always ordering extra cheese with my pepperoni pie. The pizza is better when you dine in, no question, but the delivery is still enjoyable as long as you don't let it sit. Reheat in the oven, not in the microwave, natch."
I used to live around the corner and remember the mural! Looking forward to visiting shin when I'm in town! Miss the caramelized cheese on the crust. No one does it like Pequods!
"Got a small deep dish with onion, mushroom and spinach! So delicious. Very fresh and it was enough to leave us both very full. Also had the cheesy garlic which was great. Service was awesome and super helpful. Pizza takes a while to come out so I would recommend a heavy drink and/or an app."
"I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish pizza however this place seems to pull at my heart strings.  Keep in mind, this is not your normal deep dish.  The caramelized crust is awesome and we always go with the meatball topping.   The sauce tastes similar to homemade red sauce.  You should definitely give this a try."
"Sensational. I had PTPD, post traumatic pizza disorder, after Lou Malnati's but tried Pequod's anyway. This is what every pizza wished it could be. Taste it to believe it. Wings are excellent too."
"According my friend "" the sausage dominates."" And he's right and I know there's a million great reviews of this place but it would really be lovely if they had something that was fresh like a salad or even I'll take antipasti something that isn't a pizza but if that's what you're going for go get it cuz that is delish."
"As a first timer to Chicago, I had to try the deep dish pizza since it's one of the must have foods if you are a visitor to Chicago.  Deep dish means your crust will be extra thick.  I had it with mushrooms, you can add as many toppings as you want, at a price, I didn't want to overload my pizza and wanted something simple.  The cheese was good and the crust was very tasty.  You can get something small, it will suffice for two people.  I also had the soup of the day, which was tomato bisque, very flavorful.  The waiter explained everything to us and was helpful. The place is more like a sports bar with good food."
The best pizza in Chicago. The crust is mouth watering and pictures do not do it justice. A must eat and will be back soon.
This is hands down my most visited spot for deep dish whenever I have guests in town or just for myself because it's that's good. Don't even think hat other spots could be compared to this one.
"The pizza here is just as good as the place in Morton Grove, which is to say maybe the best Chicago style pizza ever.  Still, I like the original location better.  I'm not sure why."
"My favorite restaurant and pizza in Chicago - hands down. Way better than Giordano's and Lou Malnati's if you like a more unique flavor and recipe. Yes, it gets crowded, but you can put your name in online a few days in advance and can also grab a drink at the Whale Tale next door while you wait. I never get sick of this place. Would highly recommend getting garlic on your deep dish. Definitely go here!"
"I'm a fan of the ambiance and the vibe Pequod's gives out - however their pizza was just not for me.  Their crust is very unique and obviously they have a huge following, but it was not my favorite.  I would truly recommend this place though - you have to try it and find out for yourself!! Be prepared for a line or go during an ""off-time""."
"New Yorkers tend to be snobby about pizza in Chicago. We think we have the best pizza, they think they have the best pizza, it's a rivalry through the ages.As a New Yorker used to thinner style pizza, the ""deep dish"" here was perfect. I've had deep dish elsewhere and it was too crispy (Looking at you Pizanos!)The pizza here is soft and made with amazing ingredients. It's easy to cut and a pleasure to eat. As everyone else said, the caramelized mozzarella on the crust makes the whole slide good to the last bit! I've been raving about this place for a year and was so happy to be back.This is a MUST when in Chicago! I would come back here tomorrow if I could =/"
"While Pequod's already have 1,000+ reviews, like Hot Doug's, I had to sing their praises! Hands down, the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Hands down, the best environment to eat deep dish pizza in Chicago. You can be assured that there will be a wait of at least 45 minutes every time you come here, but it is totally worth it. The quality of ingredients and specialty crust puts Pequod's above the likes Lou's, Giordano's, & Gino's East. While the aforementioned are fine estabilshments that I also enjoy, I'd rather go to Pequod's anytime. They have a cool environment as well, with TV's everywhere and memorabilia adorning the walls. The location in the heart of Lincoln Park doesn't hurt. While Bourdain is partially correct that the only time Chicagoans eat deep dish is when visitors are in town, he's COMPLETELY FULL OF BOLOGNA when he says that deep dish sucks. Deep dish is amazing and so much better than your greasy shitpile New York slice. Who are we kidding, Chicago anything is better than the New York version. GO PEQUODS!"
"When I was in Chicago I felt like it was only right that I try a deep dish. I asked around and seriously every single person I asked told me about this place. And I am so glad I took their advice.I came on an early afternoon for lunch and we were seated fairly quickly. But by the time we had left the place was packed and there was a line of people waiting to get in. The location I went to had two levels decent size plenty of space not to crowded. I went with a their classic deep dish with sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms and garlic. I do have to say it does take a little bit of time for the pizza to come out, a tad bit longer than I had expected considering the place wasn't that busy when we had place our order. But when it came out it was looking lovely. I can not speak highly enough about this pizza. It wasn't a typical deep dish I was expecting it was almost a cross between a deep and a new york style. Super crispy crust and not too deep of a pizza. The crust is actually burnt cheese !! which tasted amazing. But yeah I loved how it wasn't that 8 inch deep deep dish I feel anyone not from Chicago would imagine. I was actually able to have more than one slice. The pizza was delicious and everything was cook perfectly. Definitely understand why so many people pointed me in this direction. Probably the best deep dish in Chicago."
"Figuring where to park almost led us not to go here.  We found a spot,  and once inside the staff was very friendly,  so that was a nice start. We were seated quickly,  but came in between lunch and dinner,  so not a huge crowd.  It definitely picked up as we were leaving.  We loved the pizza,  the crust was delicious and has such a great crunchy bite.  My niece got a thin single slice and I thought it was a little soft for a thin crust,  but she enjoyed it. I would definitely come here again,  service was quick and friendly. Barnes and Noble had validated parking for 3 hours if you shop there,  but the machine that does the validation is towards the front of the store,  so you can probably be sneaky lol."
"Excellent - fav deep dish in Chicago. A place locals go, or so I;m told."
"Pequod's is the place to be if you are a crust lover. It's flavorful. It has just the right amount of crunch - crackly when you bite into it, but not too hard to cut through. But best of all is the caramelized cheese at the end...those crunchy burnt bites were the perfect end to my meal!For non-crust-lovers, I could see how Pequod's might be a tad disappointing; it is a classic pizza joint so with standard fillings (sausage, pepperoni, spinach, mushroom...). The marinara is balanced but not awe-inspiring (though how inspiring can marinara be?). I was pleased to see that our sausage was cut into thick, hearty slices.For me, though, Pequod's more than makes up for their lack of innovative flavors in that crispy, cheesy crust!"
Holy wow the best deep dish Chicago pie I have ever had! The longest I have ever had to wait to be sat and fed but was totally worth it! Highly recommended
"If anyone ever comes to visit Chicago and wants deep dish, this is the only place I take them and it's always a hit.The perfect deep dish pizza consists of: Beef, giardiniera, and spinach. That's all you need... and a party in your mouth. Yum."
"Amazing deep dish pizza at a great price. I got a person pan with 1/2 sausage, absolutely wonderful!!"
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago. I love the crust and how its slightly burnt. No other pizza is comparable any where. Expect long waits on weekends and game night. parking can be difficult too.
"Favorite pan/deep dish pizza place in Chicago (and I'm tried Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's). Crust is one of the most important parts of the pizza to me, and the caramelized crust here is the best! We order the pan pizza with peppers and tomatoes. The pizzas here are larger and less expensive than the other deep dish pizza places in Chicago. They also deliver to a wide radius and always arrive before they say they will arrive. We will be ordering our deep dish pizza here for every Chicago birthday! Pequod's Lincoln Park has been here since the 1970s. Very cool! Tip: We biked here, and there are poles outside to lock your bike to that are safe."
"To be honest, I was growing tired and bored with Deep dish pizza...but then I found Pequod's. This place blows Lou Malnati's and every other deep dish pizza I've eaten out of the water!!! I'm going to make this short and sweet cause I will be re-reviewing this place in the future...Pizza is thick, excellent sauce(perfect blend of flavor and some sweetness), excellent amount of cheese,  the sausage needs to be on each and every pizza, AND the crust is the BEST part (does not look the part but it is chewy heaven in your mouth). Great service and decent beer selection as well. GO here and grab some excellent pie for great prices."
"Fantastic pie! Had the deep dish with shrooms, green peppers, onions and meatball. It was awesome! I especially loved how the toppings are a top the sauce like a traditional thin is. Makes you really appreciate the toppings more than if they were in the middle with the cheese. and the caramelized crust is delish. It's like they put a thin rim of cheese around the cruse and burn it to a golden brown.Ambiance is nice and divey, server was cute and attentive and the bill wasn't too bad though a little pricey. (Dinner for 3 with 2 drinks each, tax and tip $83.)I'd definitely go back. Haven't had Uno's yet but overall this is the best pizza so far."
"Wow!  If you're like me and not a fan of traditional Chicago Deep Dish this is a variant you might want to try.  I personally see this as more of a pan style pizza than a deep dish due to the fluffier thicker crust.  Aside from the great sauce and structure of the pizza the biggest draw is the caramelized cheese ring around the perimeter of the pizza.  It has to be tasted to be understood.  At first your brain wants to think: ""Crap, you burned my f'n pizza!"" However it's by design.  Originally founded by Burt Katz of Gulivers and Burt's Place fame this place has to be tried.  Periods was sold by Burt many years ago but the pizza is still his design.  If you want a table get there at 5 or 5:30 or be prepared to wait over an hour especially on weekends."
"People outside Chicago have this idea that Chicagoans live on Lou Malnati's and Giordano's deep dish. I feel like it's my mission in life to let the world know, for one, real Chicagoans actually get thin crust at Giordano's, and two, if I'm getting anything thicker than that, is HAS to be Pequod's, in all the burnt cheesy crust glory there is to be had in this world. You want to eat real pizza in Chicago? This is where you go. Pequod's isn't shy with toppings, or sauce, and the cheesy crust is out of this world. Here's what you need to know about Pequods:-You will wait over an hour on Saturday night without a reservation; get reservations, or call ahead for takeout (unless you like waiting)-They have great lunch specials-Delivery zone is pretty wide-It's in Lincoln Park, but parking is pretty decent (no lot)-Goose Island on tapTaste it for yourself."
"I love pizza, so I was very excited to try a Chicago deep dish pizza. I googled where to go and I found this place . It wasn't very busy when I went in with my family . We got seated immediately ( even with a party of 10).   We started with an appetizer combo(9$) which went fast, which didn't feel worth it but we did have 10 people share it . Then we orders 2 large pizzas (17.99 each just cheese .almost 2 dollars per additional topping) . The wait was 30 mins which was understandable since it's a deep dish and takes long to cook.  So worth the wait! We didn't even finish the pizza( 2 slices left) because we were so full ! I loved the crust, I just wish it had more cheese. I already ordered extra cheese I just wanted more  Our server was very polite !She was awesome and was quick with everything, she always keep us updated with the pizza time ! One thing I found odd was that she wasn't in any sort of uniform, so she just looked like a regular guest  in a oversized sweater . Overall I really enjoyed my experience , it was my first time trying any Chicago style deep dish and look forward to comparing different places to find the best one for me"
"Amazing deep dish. Compared to Lou Malnati's, the bread is definitely thicker, but the crust is so much more flavorful and enjoyable. Instead of basically a giant plate of sausage, you get your normal balls of sausage at Pequod's. Got two personal pizzas with sausage and extra marinara, which was the perfect amount for 2-3 people. We asked for less dough because we were afraid that the pizza would be too bready for us, and it ended up being the right choice. The marinara is phenomenal, the sausages delectable, and the crust is a glorious crown of crisp cheesiness. Definitely a place to stop by if you're visiting Chicago."
"For pizza amateurs and enthusiasts alike, I implore you to make the trip to Pequod's.  It's Chicago's best known secret located in the northwest suburbs.  Their breed of pizza is still of the deep dish variety, but different in way's that make this establishment my second/third favorite pizza in Chicago. (First being Lou Malnati's)For $21.40, I ordered a medium sized pizza (6 Slices), with pepperoni and sausage.  Out of the 7 pizza parlors I visited, this place takes the longest to make, but your patience will be well rewarded.What makes Pequod's special:1)  The first thing everyone notices about a Pequod's pizza is the crust. It appears to be overly burnt, but it's actually a thin layer of cheese that was baked onto the crust. While the resulting flavor is decent and slightly charred, the texture is phenomenol--the caramelized cheese gives the back of the pie a delightful chewiness that doesn't exist in any pizza2) Pequod's has the BEST toppings I ever had in my life.  The sausage is in meatball form but is so tender it almost crumbles before you bite into it.  As for the taste, it's dynamic.  Full of flavor and bursting with seasonings that'll leave you dazed.  Same can be said about their pepperoni.  There's also an added crispness to them that makes me believe they broil their meat before serving.As for the sauce, it's sweeter than most, but less chunky.  I felt it interplayed well with the salty, thick toppings.  The cheese is basic mozzarella and has sufficient ooey-gooey goodness for any cheese lover.  I actually feel the pizza tastes better as a whole once the cheese congeals to the toppings as there is a lot of ""cheese-sliding"" when it comes out hot.  In measurements of depth, it's a thick pizza with about a 1.3 inches deep.----Conclusion: Pequod's continues to receive local and national honors of being the best pizza. Although I can see the reason for the accolades, I still feel Lou Malnati's wins by a hair.  Reason being, Lou's characterizes, to me, what deep dish is about: A layering of delicious flavors that is so deep and so stuffed, it resembles lasagna.  Pequod's is made in the format of a traditional pizza, with unique differences in quality and crust.  Overall, it's a definite must-try during your trip and something all food/pizza lovers should indulge in. Extra Notes:-Accepts credit card-$4.95 Yelp Check-in Lunch special of a Cheese personal pizza-Adam Richman (Man VS Food) favorite pizza joint in America-Atmosphere leans more on the chill side and decor seems aged, but less touristy. - Wait times are long and it does get crowded-Servers are very friendly and suggestive-Significantly further from downtown, but take the OTA off madison&clinton and exit at Clybourn. Walk north for about 10 minutes until you get to Webster and turn right. An Uber will cost about $18-Restrooms are clean"
Awesome nom noms.The pies were delicious.Recommend calling them ahead of time if you want to pick up. Otherwise it's a 45 minute wait in perfection.
Favorite pizza place in Chicago. Can't get enough of the Pan pizza... drool
"Crust is my favorite. I keep going back and forth between this and Lou's being my favorite. Pizza alone, Pequod's may win, but sides and salads don't compare to Lou's. Wish they had more locations...must try for deep dish."
"An hour and half wait then 40 min wait for pizza? Normally, I would say hell to the no. But in this rare, rare occasion, the wait was worth it!! And I never, ever say that! This pizza is beyond amazing. The crust is airy and not too dense and cheese, oh lord the cheese is incredible. Again, totally worth it!!"
"This is the best deep dish pizza! I have to get it every time I go to Chicago. This time I went for lunch and the lunch special is on point! The side salad you get, I would not recommend wasting 2$ or however much it was because it was just some iceberg and cucumbers. The crust is like burnt carmelized cheese, I dream about this pizza and can't wait to go back to Chicago to have it. You have to get sausage on it!"
I'm from NY and a bit of a pizza snob.  I was never a fan of Chicago style pizza until I ate here.   The small is big enough for 2 to share and was VERY GOOD!
"The perfect local deep dish! Better than all the chain/touristy spots.I am a big fan of deep dish pizza, but I usually and left with the chain restaurants or a store that makes deep dish taste like a block of cheese or tomato puree.  Not the case here. Pequod's is perfect! It has full flavor and lots of toppings options and is reasonably priced. The venue is also really comfortable and neighborly. I am always going to get my deep dish pizza here."
"Pequod's is hands down my favorite pizza place in Chicago. The thin and pan pizzas are both excellent but the pan caramelized crust is the shining gem amongst all deep dish out there. My NY boyfriend is very picky with his pizza (and not usually a fan of deep dish) but we equally love it and always bring our visitors here. The wait (both to sit and for your pizza) can add up during peak hours so it's better to come before 6. Regardless it is worth the wait. If you haven't tried it yet, do yourself the favor!"
Love this place!  Best pizza ever.  Priced right as well!
Have had on numerous occasions.  Fantastic always.  The crust is quite possibly better than Lou Mals butter crust.  I go back and forth continuously.  One thing that puts this place ahead of Lous is the amount of toppings they put on.  It is ridiculous in a great way.  Order it well done.   Favorite thick/pan pizza in America.  Keep up the good work.
Best deep dish in Chicago. Maybe the world. Long wait times but it is worth every minute. A must every time I'm in the Windy City.
"The first time I went, the crust tasted amazing! The second time I went the pizza was ok! I personally think the pizza needs more sauce! This place is open until around 2am and is casual."
The lunch special is $5 caramelized personal pizza at the skokie location is a must have- bucket list worthy.
"Among my hometown Chicago friends, Pequod's is the #1 recommendation for deep dish BESIDES the chains (Lou's, Giordano's, etc.). And why? The crust. It's great. Unfortunately, I think they simply under-season their pizza. The rest of the pie ends up a little bit bland for my taste, especially given the slightly inflated price (relative to the chains mentioned above). That said, if you're going out for deep dish (versus ordering in/picking up), this is one of the best places to do that - the environment is comfortable and kitschy in only the right ways."
Pequod's may have the best pizza that I have ever had! I was a visitor to Chicago and liked the reviews that I had read about this restaurant. My wife and I arrived and we're seated fairly soon because we called ahead for priority seating. We ordered a medium deep dish pepperoni pizza and I thought it was phenomenal.
"Ask 5 people in the city what their favorite pie is in Chicago and I would bet that 4 would say Pequod's. When people come to visit from out of town, this place is my go-to for the pizza portion on their trip."
"Our daughters swear this is the best pizza.It is very very good.Service is very good.Street parking is difficult.The decor is Chicago bar / pizza place.Price point is just fine.Definitely not heart healthy, but I recommend if you are in the area."
"came here on my visit to Chicago since everyone swear by it. I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza due to the tomato sauce, I normally get the white sauce pizza because the red sauce is a bit sour for me. However I could actually enjoy the pizza here as the sauce is not sour, and everything together makes it quite delicious. Call ahead so you don't have to wait for hours and also place your pizza order over the phone because those deep deep dish pizza takes over an hour to make especially when it's busy."
"I've been to the other Chicago pizza staple joints but I was told I had to try Pequods.Lincoln Park area was quite a bit north of our downtown hotel location but my wife and I had time to kill and thought we may as well visit since we're in town. This place was definitely worth the visit. It's not fancy, but who cares? It definitely has its own character, which is what we love in a local joint. The pizza is fantastic. You can choose thin crust or deep dish. We opted for the deep dish because, hey, we're in Chicago. They also advertise their crust as being carmelized due to the blackened dish they bake it in. The top edge of the crust turns black as well which makes it unique. If you are looking for a Chicago deep dish experience and have not tried Pequods yet, what are you waiting for??"
"Pequod's is Chicago's best pizza. That's it. I've grown up in Chicago my entire life and have had the best thin, pan and deep dish all over the city. When it comes to pan pizza, Pequod's is the place. The crust is caramelized and crunchy, the pizza has just the right amount of cheese and sauce. A lot of places either put too much sauce or too much cheese, but the ratio is perfection here. The pepperoni gets a crisp on the edges, too. Even when the place was packed, the wait wasn't too long -- 30 minutes. There are so many seats here, with two bars and two floors of seating, you won't be waiting too long (at least from my experience)."
"By far the absolute best pizza in Chicago.I am not originally from here but I feel as though once you've had this pizza, you are allowed to be a snob because I'd venture to say that this is the pizza the creators of deep dish pizza had in mind on that fateful day.Pequods is open late which is obviously the sign of an amazing pizza place, all of the employees are very friendly and the restaurant is always clean.The pizza takes a little long (which is expected) but wow is it worth the wait!!! They have a full bar so you are able to keep the party going or get the party started! The best part is that no one tells you how to have your pizza party so you can pick the toppings!The restrooms are very clean which is super important and not to mention there is more than one!PS the pizza is amazing when reheated... And boy do we love having those leftovers."
"Pequod's is definitely not overrated.  The pan pizza is so good!  Two of us ordered a medium, and it was enough for us to each have 2 slices (and leave so stuffed) and then have another 2 slices to take home.I love that the crust is still crunchy on the bottom.  This is something that other pizzerias haven't mastered.  Giordano's has long been my favorite ""Chicago"" pizza, because I love cheese (and more cheese), but Pequod's has them beat.  I was appalled at the idea of burnt crust, but somehow it works.  Sorry Lou's, you've got major competition too!We also shared a half salad - the Pequod's salad.  The slices of provolone are shaped like little whales *squeal*!The beer menu is decent, but the pricing was a little more craft beer bar than local pizza place.  I had a Goose Island Green Line for $6.  You can request a table on their website - and it's foolish if you don't do this for a Saturday night.  My request was for 5:30, but because of the snow and traffic, we didn't get here until closer to 6:00 p.m.  When we arrived, I told the hostess about our reservation, but we were handed a pager and informed of a 10 minute wait.   We were seated at the worst possible table in the place.  During our entire meal, patrons were shoving by as they crowded in the ""waiting"" area, which is essentially maybe ten square feet of floor in front of the hostess stand.  I got elbowed in the back a few times, sometimes it was inevitable and some people apologized.  Others didn't and were too consumed with grouching about their wait.  Even the servers had trouble getting through the crowd!  If you can, get a seat as far away from the door as possible.  I'm happy that even though we were late, we got a seat quickly, but the layout sucks and Pequod's is best avoided during peak times unless you're placing a carryout order.The mascot still has me confused.  I don't know what a whale with...is that a thong on it's face?...has to do with pizza."
"I had this right when I landed in Chicago and it was absolutely amazing!! It's by far the best deep dish pizza I ever had. I ordered the pizza half pepperoni and half sausage with mushrooms and bell peppers. The sausage and pepperoni tasted like it was freshly made. I loved the amount of marinara sauce on the pizza. The best part was the crisp cheese on the crust! It was so good, I had to get it again 3 days later :) if I'm ever in town, I don't think I'll go to any other pizzeria (tried Lou Malnati's a day later and prefer Pequod's)."
eat's up food critics! an abundance of words is not needed to explain this 8th wonder of the world. the deep dish with a caramelized crust was baked to perfection. that is all. a must go.
"Pizza was good,  it was just more crust than toppings.  Able to split a10"" for two people and not get overly stuffed. Great atmosphere, and our plan to go mid - afternoon on a Saturday worked well with only a 15 minute wait time."
"Amazing pizza, even worth bearing its sports bar bro ambiance. It wasn't quite as heavy as other Chicago deep dish I've had, which was refreshing. The crust is what made it different.We arrived at 6:15 on a Saturday night and waited an hour and fifteen minutes for pizza, which was noted on a sign before we ordered. Of course this varies, but plan accordingly if you are on a schedule. Ordering an appetizer, which arrived in about fifteen minutes, helped!"
"Good pizza, love the burnt cheese crust but 90% of the pizza is bread as you will see if some of the customer pictures...it would be perfect if the fixed the ratio to be 50% bread, 25% cheese, and 25% sauce. Overall not bad but my favorite Chicago deep dish remains to be Lou Malnati's.Oh and don't sleep on the chocolate chip cookie. One of the best cookies I've had!"
Pequods is my love. Their crust just gets me. So caramelized and delicious - so good. I would suggest going at an off time otherwise the wait time get pretty long. Getting it to-go just isnt the same for me but that's also an option. One of my favorite pizza places to eat at in Chicago.
"Everyone in Chicago has a favorite place to get their deep dish pizza, and when I first started the bf he was all ""You've never had Pequod's? That's just crazy! We're going."" I used to think maybe deep dish just wasn't my thing, but it was because I'd never had Pequod's! From the caramelized crust, to the ooey gooey cheesiness, to the little morsels of pineapple paired with canadian bacon - did ya forget I'm a Hawaiian pizza freak? - I've never been disappointed and I will always pick Pequod's as my fave when anyone inquires. In 4+ year love affair with  Pequod's, I'd never been to this location, but on my last trip to Chicago this was the most convenient, so off we went. We called in and ordered for takeout about 45 minutes before we'd be able to get there and upon our arrival there were dozens of people outside waiting just to get inside to order their pizza. From waiting in line to pay to being handed the yummiest pizza possible, we waited about 10 minutes, if that. Obviously they're doing it right over at Pequod's!"
"""I'm a thin crust girl,"" I've always said.Well, after visiting Chicago...not anymore. Day two in the Windy City, I had Giordano's which was delicious, but day four with Pequod's blew every other pizza I've ever had out of the water. Pepperoni, pineapple, giardiniera. Ohmygoshhh. I'm back in Texas and still cannot stop daydreaming about this dang pizza."
"You always hear about the battle between Gino's, Lou Malnatis and Giordano's for the title of ""Best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago."" They are all awesome, but Pequod's gives you a different taste of Chicago deep dish pizza. Instead of a mountain of cheese (which is awesome) their deep dish pizza is made deep with fluffy, crisp, cooked to perfection dough. I wish our experience with the service had been better. We had ordered a salad, which never came. Perhaps going on a weekday would provide better service when it is less crowded. The surrounding area is also fun to explore!"
"Carmelized crusts.  Nuff said.Be prepared to wait.If you get a booth and order some beers, the 45 min wait doesn't seem that bad, and the closeness of the group makes every night a fun outing."
"Pequod's was an unexpectedly fantastic deep dish.  Unexpected because I'd never heard of it, and it may be the best deep dish I've ever had!I had a deep dish with pepperoni, pineapple, and extra sauce which would not normally be my first choice, but was absolutely delicious.  I'm told it can be slightly dry on sauce without the extra order, so give that a shot if you feel like something is missing.  The cheesy burnt crust was also an amazing surprise as I don't normally like burnt anything, especially cheese but it too was fantastic!Next time I go back I'm going to have to try  Italian Beef and Jalapeno or Hot Giardiniera!I'll keep the review simple since I had delivery - order it, chow it, sleep it off, repeat."
Awesome deep dish pizza and great service! Definitely coming back here again! This is nos my favorite deep dish pizza now.
"Ate here for the 2nd time a few days ago!! Best deep dish I had so far- beats Giordanos any day. The pizza comes out super hot. The cheese is absolutely amazing, so creamy, melts right off the pizza. I only tried the deep dish pizza pie and it's to die for!The reason for the 4 stars, however, as follows:They get pretty busy so service can be a little slow. First time our waitress was still great, despite how busy it was. The second time we came here we felt a little ignored and forgotten. Also, if you like a lot of toppings, can come out pretty expensive. They charge about 3 extra dollars PER topping. I love my toppings, so our pizza pie went from $18 to about $46!!! Nevertheless, totally worth it! Will come here whenever I absolutely need a, to die for, Chicago style deep dish. Worth the 1 hr drive here for me!"
"Best deep dish ""Chicago style"" pizza in the world. Friendly staff, service is good, pizza takes 45min+ to cook, so make sure you have time. Really well priced bc You only need 1 slice, maybe 2 if your a heavy eater. Highly recommend!!"
"Incredible pizza. The crust is a thing of beauty, like fresh baked bread but caramelized and seamlessly integrated into the rest of the pizza. The wait times and limited space in the restaurant are the only drawbacks."
"My favorite pizza in the city, yep even better than Lou Malnati's which I never thought I would say about any deep dish ever. Love love LOVE this place. Gets CRAZYYYYY packed though so watch out for that and plan ahead of time during cubs games."
"In my opinion, best pizza in Chicago. I love the crust and I would recommend it to anyone! May take a bit long but definitely worth it."
"Right off the plane and first on my list was pequods! This place seems busy but the wait isn't too bad. There is street parking a little further away, so you'll have to do a little walking. I had the lunch special, one personal cheese deep dish pizza and salad. Plus a side order of buffalo wings. The buffalo wings came out first and it was great, small crispy wings. The pizza didn't come out til 30 mins later. I wasn't t aware it would take so long until I over heard the waitress at the table next to us saying it takes 30 mins to cook. It was totally worth the wait tho. That crispy edge with over flowing cheese was soooo good. I'd fly back just for this! I didn't try any other deep dish pizzas in town because the pictures and reviews for other restaurants just didn't compare."
"Yummy, yummy, yummy I got Pequods in my belly.  Everyone is totally jelly.Caramelized cheese crust is a must!  I eat it til I bust!Toppings galore...nothing here is a bore.Had takeout, so I don't know what the restaurant is about!"
"I've been a loyal fan of Lou's deep dish my whole life... Until I tried this place.  Holy crap.  AMAZING. It was super crowded and we waited almost an hour for our table, but it was well worth it.The burnt cheesie crust is like nothing I've ever tasted before.  I never thought pizza could be a life changing experience, but here we are."
"This is a must stop when I visit Chicago. The pizza is absolutely amazing. Love the thick crust. Crispy, flavorful.  Sauce is awesome. Always packed with pizza lovers. Try the meatball sandwich."
"Go right now! Seriously, stop whatever you're doing and head to be Pequod's.This might just be the best pizza I've ever had in my whole life! I didn't get to eat at Lou's this time so I'm not sure I can compare. The ratio of sauce to crust to toppings is perfect, I'm not sure what people are complaining about on here. If you love deep dish pizza, then this is perfect for you.The pepperoni on top is razor thin so the pieces on the top were almost like a chip they were crunchy. I picked them all off and still have plenty of pepperoni that were soft left behind. There was an ample amount of toppings as I got pepperoni and pineapple on top of the $4.95 cheese special they have at lunch. Which by the way, also includes a beverage. Such a deal! You pay $.80 extra for each additional toppings.I also spend the extra $2.50 on a salad, just because I eaten total junk food this week and thought that might be good for me. The salad was tiny but good. They make their own ranch and Italian.It's so hard to explain the crust that people are talking about on here, the cheese on the outside is amazing, it doesn't taste burnt at all, it's just crispy goodness.  Each of the pizzas is cooked in its own cast-iron skillet.The sauce is perfect. It's a great complement to the crust and the toppings, unlike some other places in Chicago, it doesn't overrule the entire pie.Really, I think if I lived in Chicago, I would have to get a job at this place as the person that eats the crust that anybody leaves behind when they're finished. I guess I'll have to pay them too. I doubt they'll pay me. But really, it's that good!!!!!"
"I mean I don't know what else I can really add to the accolades that have been heaped upon Pequod's for years.  I first visited in 2008 and it was instant love.  Since then I've ordered delivery off and on over the years.  It was my recent move out of their delivery zone (literally just a couple blocks, c'mon guys!!!! Hook a brother up) that finally forced me back to the brick and mortar.  Dear god, I'm an idiot.  It's so much better in the shop than delivery.  The perfect crunchiness on the bottom of the crust for the pan pizza simply can't be maintained the same when you have it delivered.  I love this place, it is consistently the best pizza in Chicago."
My favorite pizza in Chicago. Super crowded and loud but worth it!
"I've been coming to Pequod's chicago for over 10 years now and hands down, Pequods has the best pizza in Chicago!!!! I'm not one for pan pizza or deep dish (as i tend to enjoy thin crust more....) but this place absolutely does pizza right.  The carmelized cheese crust is what makes this pizza the best.  Best times to go are during the weekdays (if you can get the time off!).  Parking is a bit difficult on the street but worth the drive up to Chicago.  They have a second location in the North suburbs if you live near morton grove.  Both places are great and worth your time if you want great pizza at inexpensive prices."
"By far the best deep dish pizza in Chicago!! Blows the competitors out, but keep in mind this shows in the delivery time! Be ready to order 2 hours before you want some pizza!"
"Pequod's pizza is my husband's favorite deep dish in the city and of course I had to check it out! I went on a Wednesday night and two people on a date can get seated in 20 minutes or less! The restaurant is actually larger than it appears on the outside and they have lots of tables and booths for groups or just couples. What I did not realize was the pizza crust is burnt, which is apparently their thing. It doesn't have a burnt taste, but it is flavorful and the sauce is more runny than chunky tomato. Pequod's definitely has more of a unique neighborhood-local vibe that you don't find with most other deep dishes places in Chicago which seem more chain-y. I found the pizza to be a little greasier than expected with a deep dish and expect another 20 minute wait time for the deep dish. We ordered a large between the two of us and only at 1-2 slices. Large is LARGE and filling at Pequod's. I ended up feeling sick after eating it tho but that may have just been my own fault. I gave this a four star because of the grease and the small drink list."
"Love it, so different than the typical deep dish which I love as well. Great taste you won't get anywhere else!"
Of course you had to get deep dish in Chicago. My friend has tried all the popular ones but all her local friends say that this is the best one. Unfortunately this is not really close to downtown so you have to uber it there. It says that it closes at midnight but I think it was open and there was a sign that said til 1-1:30am. So we had a 11pm dinner and it takes about 30-45 minutes to make it. You get to make your own so we got two deep dish: One large with sausage and pepperoni and the other with mushroom and spinach split along 6 people. I thought it was pretty good and quite filling. Now I am not a deep dish type of girl because I want to taste all the ingredients instead of a pile of tomato sauce. Two larges was a lot for a group of six since the crust is so damn thick and filling so maybe a large and medium for a group like ours. I cant tell if it is better or not than the next since they sorta taste the same.
"Being new to Chicago, I was told prior to my move that Giordano's was the place to go for deep dish. Working at a Two Michelin Star Restaurant molecular cooks said that Pequod's is the place to go for a good pizza. It certainly is, the flavors accent one another in a way that is extraordinary. The caramelized crust makes it unlike anything else you'll find in Chicago. Definitely making the trip to Lincoln Park whenever I'm in the mood for pizza."
"Landed in Chicago and this was the first stop I made at 11PM on a Friday night. There were three of us and we were seated promptly without a reservation. It was quite packed however, and we were brought upstairs for additional seating. Definitely a divey vibe with the dim lighting and neon signs. We went ahead and just ordered a medium pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. This is probably just common sense but don't come hungry because obviously deep dish will take a while to bake and we were dying of hunger waiting for that pie to come out. When it finally arrived at our table, it was glorious. The cheese, the sauce, the MEAT (sausage was so good!!) , the crust all came together to become a symphonic meal. I'm a deep dish noob, so I was taken aback by just how monstrous it was. I was barely able to finish my two slices of pizza, which is pretty shameful for me. Basically, the first piece was heaven, the second piece was a little less enjoyable because I was already strangely full and the crust wasn't as crispy. I was also surprised by the sauce to dough ratio because I had this preconception that Chicago deep dish would be very saucey. I was wrong. Not too mad about it because it clearly works for this pie. I probably wouldn't frequent this place if I lived in Chicago, but I'm very glad I got to try it while I was there!"
"I hit up Lou's and Pequod's on my recent trip to Chicago and I have to admit Pequod's wins. It was a much more satisfying pizza that was still tasty on the flight home the next day.We ordered a sausage and giardiniera on our pie and they were fantastic. Quick comparison, Lou's has a thinner style crust that is formed into an pan and is really crispy and a thick layer of fresh cheese and a hearty very fresh tasting sauce, not very greasy even with the buttered crust. Pequod's on the other hand is a thicker crust formed into the pan that is amazingly flavorful and juicy, The cheese is dripping off the edge of the pie and is much more of your decadent style pizza cheese. The house made sausage is not as fully loaded across the pie as Lou's does but it is everywhere and it is very tasty and you can tell it is made fresh. The sauce is not as hearty as Lou's but is more flavorful (in my opinion). The giardiniera was this awesomely spicy little Italian pepper that really provided a great kick of spicy to the pizza. Think more long hots flavor than jalapeno. Finally, I think the caramelized crust wins over the buttered crust hands down. It is an awesome layer of crispy deliciousness!. It was worth trying both since it was my first time there but on my next visit it is Pequod's or bust. Side note: call ahead and get your name on the list. They don't do reservations but you can call on your way over because this place is packed and even after your wait it takes 35 minutes for your pies to cook. But that is the nature of the deep dish pies."
"Absolutely unforgettable and delicious. I cannot believe I've lived in Chicago for 8 and 1/2 years and never tried It !  The atmosphere is cozy and darker, which is what I prefer. The staff is extremely friendly and PROUD of where they work. Our server was very excited that we were trying the pizza for the first time. We were starving so we also sampled almost every appetizer (mostly the fried stuff!). Lots of tasty dipping sauces :) Everything came out in a timely fashion and our drinks were never empty.It was busy because it was the same weekend as Riot Fest but I don't think we had to wait longer than 20 minutes for our table. We were able to find a spot at the bar and enjoy some strong drinks while we waited.Hands down, it's the best deep dish pizza I've ever had in Chicago.  I like it because the crust is light and fluffy instead of resembling pie crust. I can actually eat more than once piece at Pequods! If you have guests from out of town who want to try deep dish, skip all of the downtown places and go to Pequod's ."
"Amazing deep dish pizza! My bf and I had the pan pizza with sausage, pepperoni and spinach! It is a little pricey for extra toppings but overall, it was worth it! I'll definitely recommend this to everyone!"
"Went here on our last night in town and since Chicago is known for their deep dish I had to go to the best.  Read this was the best deep dish in town. I'm not a deep dish person but when in Rome, right?  We came for dinner and there was quite the wait. We ended up finding seats at the bar so we ordered our pie. We shared the small which was more than enough. One slice filled me up and we actually had to take the rest home. Overall a good pizza joint."
"So I finally had a chance to try the Pe of the Quod at a co-worker get-together recently and I must say: not being a big deep dish pizza fan myself (I know.. I am clearly an extraterrestrial since I'm from Chicago and not a deep dish fan) this was hands-down the best deep-dish pizza I've ever had. The pizza was cooked perfectly, a cheesy masterpiece, and very flavorful overall. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere of the place energetic and fun.Final Verdict:If I find myself, on the rare occasion that it is, hankering for some deep dish pizza - I can't see myself going anywhere but to Pequod's!"
"Ordered a small pan pizza and it was delicious. I have to say the place isn't the most consistent in terms of taste. My first experience left me disappointed, but with another go at it I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. I was disappointed with the portion size because me and my lady-friend were still feeling hungry. We were fooled into thinkng the pizza was ""good for 1-2 people."" Aside from consistency and portion size, the staff were friendly and not intrusive, the prices were fair, and crust was great"
"My personal favorite pizza restaurant in Chicago, the service is good and it's a Blackhawks fan's dream. This is a great date restaurant especially if you pick the spot because it's always a hit. I love the people who work there. They are very busy but still manage to make you feel special.It does take a while to get your Pizza but it's worth it, so plan your time wisely, relax and enjoy this amazing restaurant.Martha Daniel"
"I love my thin crust pizza, but when in Chicago...I had a personal deep dish pizza and it arrived in front of me, piping hot, fresh out of the oven. First bite... ""Damn... that's good."" This was the first time I've ever REALLY enjoyed a deep dish pizza. I loved the burnt cheese on the edges, too!We sat at the bar and the bartender was really pleasant and quick with our drinks, so I appreciated that.Will be back!"
In a disappointing search to find deep dish Chicago style pizza I was blessed by the pizza gods to make it the Pequod's on my last night in town. The pizza was everything I could have hoped for. If I would have found this place earlier there's a chance I would've eaten every meal here for the whole week.
"Review is for delivery (food) only, so cannot comment on the ambiance.  Pizza is very good, deep pan pizza.  Toppings are applied with a heavy hand, crust is crispy on the outside and everything arrived on time.  Important to note, this is pan pizza (more similar to Lou Malnati's, Gino's) and not Chicago-style stuffed pizza (i.e. Bacinos, Giordanos)."
"There's nothing like having deep dish on A cold winter day right after picking out a Christmas tree at a local tree lot. That's my favorite memory of Pequods because it was my first experience at delicious deep dish! Now over a year later it has become one of my MANY favorite pizza stops in Chicago. I also highly recommend their jalapeño poppers... I don't like jalapeños and still ogle over them! Service is normal, sometimes great, sometimes average!"
"Very tasty! Visiting from out of town and given many recommendations of where to get deep dish, but Pequod's was the most recommended from friends. Not disappointed at all. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but were seated in less than 15. The appetizer combo was not bad - the jalepeno poppers were the best, so I think I would have just gone with those.Our deep dish was super yummy and surprisingly not too heavy. I've had deep dish before that left me feeling  uncomfortably full, but this deep dish was filling without the gross greasy feeling afterwards. We got mushrooms and fresh garlic toppings that were very fresh and delicious. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town."
"As my friend (Angie G.) took me around Chicago as a tourist, I was so excited to try this place! She ranted and raved that it was the best pizza I would ever put in my mouth. We ordered a big deep dish. I believed we ordered some sort of meat lover's special and she ordered the giardenara and pineapple. I had some of both and both were AMAZING. The taste was spot on, cooked to perfection, and it came out piping hot. The downside to this place is the wait time. It does take a long time for the pizzas to come out! However, I don't really mind this because I know my pizza was made to order. WARNING: I recently went back for a second visit during the lunch hour. I ordered a ""personal pizza"". OMG. Horrible. Do not order the personal pizzas. Stick to the big deep dish, their specialty! A night and day difference, I tell you.The service was good; the vibe is like a sports bar. A ""chill"" pizza joint where you can have a genuinely good time over pizza and beer. Go!"
"Thin, crispy, tasty.  Maybe the best pizza in Chicago."
"Don't think it looks like much from the outside? Haven't you ever heard the saying, don't judge a book by its cover? I had lived near here for months and  I can't tell you how many times I passed this place without ever thinking twice - that is until I heard just about every single one of my friends mention it.So I broke down to check it out and I'm so glad I did. The night I was there both floors were filled with a diverse clientele including young couples on a casual date night, college kids coming in for a study break, and large parties with three generations of family members all enjoying the food, college football, and atmosphere. The pizza was phenomenal, especially the sauce and the crust sets it apart from some of the other standard Chicago pizza favs. I personally love the fact that you get the idea this was once someone's home turned into a pizza joint that still makes you feel as comfortable as if you were in someone's home.It has become one of my all-time favorite Chicago pizzas!"
Kept asking around all the locals and uber drivers where the best deep dish was and pequouds and lou malnatis were the names that kept coming up. I chose here because it seemed like the better place to drink a beer too. It didn't disappoint though. Great pizza!
"Got a dope lunch special.  For $4.95 you get a personal pan pizza (7"") and a fountain drink OR pint of Bud Light.   Hard to beat for 5 dollars you get a pizza and a beer.  Special is M-F 11am-3pm.  Place was pretty empty for a lunch period which was great for me.  I wasn't trying to wait long to be seated. Overall the pizza was really good.  For lunch and the value it was great.  The edges were slightly burnt a lil too much for my liking but the pizza itself had lots of flavor.  The sauce was perfect and it has more than enough ground beef on it for me.  They definitely weren't stingy with the toppings.  Beer - Bud Light from a tap.  Not hard to mess up LOL.Place is essentially a pizza parlor, not restaurant.  So if you are looking for something classier, go somewhere else.  But if you are like me and just want quality food, affordable food and have the option of getting a drink as well, Pequod's is the place.  Next time I go back I'll likely try something else and see how the bartender pours and I'll update my review. You see I said next time right... I'll be back."
"My husband is obsessed with pizza, so when we were headed to Chicago for our engagement pictures, we had to stop at Pequods. We've tried all the other Chicago pizza places and this was next on our list. We really liked it. The crust is different. I believe it's caramelized. I was told to ask. For extra sauce and I'm so glad we did. Our only issue was the wait - super crowded and you can't make reservations. The appetizers were good too. We ordered the chicken fingers and fried mushrooms. This place is really popular in Chicago so get there early!"
"Long wait, but pretty worth it. My favorite element in pizza is the tomato sauce and pequods douse their pizzas in a deliciously sweet tomato sauce. Really like their cheese and the oven burnt crust was incredible. The dough component was just ok but overall good pizza can be found here. Loved that it was Blackhawks themed!One negative that sticks out was that the hostess seemed overworked. She crossed our name off the waitlist twice, messed up the number of people in our party, and we weren't seated until we went up to her a third time and asked how much longer the wait would be."
"The third stop on the pizza tour and the second deep dish pizza we tried.  I got the pepperoni and the bf got spinach.  The pepperoni deep dish was absolutely the BEST pizza I've had during the entire trip in Chicago and the best deep dish pizza I'd ever had (well, out of about four different choices).  There was a decent amount of sauce with a perfectly caramelized crust.  I wish we ate here first so I wasn't so full of unsatisfactory pizza.  The place was pretty crowded and loud when we arrived.  We were seated upstairs but the tour guide had called ahead for our orders so the wait time wasn't long at all.  This is probably not the usual case though.  I would totally stop by on my next Chicago visit."
"My 2nd favorite pizza place next to Giordonos!Came in on a Sunday night around 7PM and wait was about 15 minutes.I really like the bar vibe at this restaurant and sportsplaying in the background.Pizza was amazing! took about 40-45 minutes to bake a deep dishand they are super generous with the topping you order. Servicewas good too, nothing to complain about! definitely make a visit!"
"Deep dish ain't pizza; it's lasagna with bread. That's cool, though. It still tastes pretty good, and I've yet to meet a native Chicagoan who will fight to the death to defend his city's pizza as the finest creation known to man.That said, I've eaten my fair share of deep dish and figured it's always good to have a place in your back pocket for when the family and friends come to visit. I've done the big three gauntlet and Lou Malnati's is my winner. However, I asked around for the best ""local"" spot to grab a deep dish slice, and the answer came back Pequod's.Pequod's is small, grungy, and really looks like half a bar than serves pizza on the side. But aside from all that, Pequod's actually makes a rather nice pie. There's nothing special on the menu, just the basics. Start with a cheese, and ingredient your way up.I was already massively hungry, so we ordered jalapeno poppers to start. I'll take the cheddar/yellow/orange filling over cream cheese any day of the week, so Pequod's already got off the blocks well. Still not as good as Jack in the Box, which makes an incomparable popper. But good.Pequod's deep dish, unlike the Big 3, isn't overzealous with the bread. It's still a chore to eat, but for different reasons. Pequod's says it caramelizes its crust, but what that really means is they char it to a crisp. For a guy that loves blackened anything (especially char on brisket), I loved it. Aside from the char, the breading is thinner than the typical deep dish, and much easier to eat. The sauce is plentiful (another check mark in my book), and although I'd heard that Pequod's goes easy on the cheese, the white stuff was still overkill for me. The tomato sauce came extra sweet, almost, say, Pizza Hut style as opposed to the more pomodoro/crushed tomato sourish taste."
"Hands down my favorite pizza! Introduced to this pizza a few months ago and now any time in Chicago I order it!  Really wish they delivered to Florida as I've been craving their cheese burnt crust -- mm mmm good! I would wait forever for this pizza!   If you're in Chicago or in the vicinity of the Chicagoland area, do yourself a favor and head over to Pequods!"
"Best chicago style pizza in the city. I don't always eat deep dish, but when I do, it is Pequod's. Take your out of town friends here or order for pick-up or delivery. Get gardinera on the pizza! Adds another dimension of Chicago flavor and heat!"
"Had a 9 hour layover in Chicago on my way to LA. Figured it would be inappropriate for me to spend a few hours in Chicago without having a deep dish pizza. After asking the locals, it seemed like this establishment had the best deep dish pizza in town... And it seems like they were right - it's hard to believe there's a better deep dish pizza.The crust was caramelized and incredibly delicious. The cheese... it was orgasmic... no better way to describe it. Each toppings (we got pepperoni, sausage and basil) were so flavourful, you can taste each one with every bite!The servers were very hospitable and friendly.Highly recommend this place!"
"This is the best pizza in Chicago. It's also a little off the beaten path, so it is mostly locals, which is nice.  It's still always busy and will generally have at least a 30 minute wait, but it's worth it.  Pro tip: Get the personal pizza, as it's about right for one hungry person and it maximizes the caramelized crust.  Also, their lunch special is the best deal in the city.  It used to be $4.95 for a personal pizza, salad and drink, though it may be a bit more now."
"Giordano's has always been our Chicago pizza go-to, but a friend asked us to meet him here, so away we went. Let me tell you, that crust? Like unicorns and pixie dust magic. Like glory and praise Jesus, Hallelujah. Place was packed, and still only waited about 30 minutes for a table. Beer selection was ok, but honestly, I'd drink my own sweat if I had to to have another piece of that pizza."
I really enjoy their deep dish! Super flavorful and you can add many toppings unlike other strict pizza places. Try your deep dish Hawaiian style with Canadian bacon and pineapple. Yum!!
The best deep dish pizza in Chicago hands down. Be prepared for a long wait but it is worth it.
Excellent pizza.  This place is better than pizanos in my opinion. A good tip for the thin crust pizza is to get a side of marinara sauce.  It's delicious
"Really good deep dish, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype or was the holy grail of deep dish like some Yelpers made it seem out to be. The pizza tasted like any other ol' deep dish pizza until you get to the crispy, burnt crust, which was indeed delicious, but not really a deal maker in my opinion. I did really like that they heaped on the toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives) and thought that the cheese/sauce ratio was perfect. My table also ordered the appetizer sampler, which was yummy because we were starving, but nothing special (besides the jalapeno poppers which were gross and filled with Cheez Wiz type cheese). Like other Yelpers have said, the service here is definitely lacking. My friend pre-ordered the pizza at 7 PM and said we'd be coming in at 7:45 PM and the waiter rudely asked my friend to call back at 7:15 PM to place the order since the pies take 30 min. My friend then just suggested that they just write down our order and put it in at 7:15, which thankfully they agreed to. This kind of left a bad taste in our mouths, especially since the pizza wasn't ready until about 8:15 anyways.Overall, I think Pequods is a place that everyone who likes deep dish should try, but don't expect it to be out of this world if you've eaten a lot of deep dish because it's not much different from other good pizza joints (e.g., Lou Malnati's, Ginos East)."
"If you only have time to try one pizza place in Chicago, I highly recommend Pequod's. Definitely worth the trip from downtown. Between Lou's, Gino's and Giordano's, I thought Pequod's tasted the best. Their crust differentiates them from the rest. It is most like what a real pizza should taste like. It is crispy, but not dry and it actually has a flavor to it. The others are tasteless and like biting into a brick.Pizza is absolutely delicious and this Italian thinks their Italian Beef is excellent as well."
"Living in New Hampshire now, there is not much food wise we miss more than great Chicago pizza..   Pequod is a banner example of all that is truly superb about pizza. So glad we had time to stop in and enjoy. We'll be back the next time we come home!!!!"
I love Pequod's pizza. I always take out-of-towners here if they ask to experience some Chicago deep dish. The wait can be long but it is worth it. I usually don't like sausage pizza but their sausage is delicious.Salads also good.
"My first Chicago deep dish pizza! I didn't realize Pequods is so highly rated - love my cousins for taking me here.It was a Tuesday night, seemed like a medium size crowd. No wait. I believe we ordered pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and green pepper on a pan pizza. It took a noticeably long time for the pizza to get to our table, but it was worth the wait. It tasted fresh, filling, and scrumptious. I don't think it's something I could eat too often, but it's definitely a good meal.Great deep dish pizza experience, even with the long wait. Seems like a great casual spot.Can I still go back to regular pizza after this?"
"You can't say enough about this pizza. It is always awesome. Consistently great quality. Good service. This place does everything but work off the excess calories. If you haven't eaten here, you must..."
"We waited a long time to get our food and my drink was never refilled. As for the pizza itself, it's the best pizza I've ever had in my life!"
"Can't go wrong with the lunch special for around $5.00. Good solid flavor, some people complain about crust but the crust to typing ratio is atl balanced. A must try for any friends or family in from out of town or first date."
"One of my new favorite deep dish pizza spots. I've been to Giordano's, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and now this one and Gino's East will be my ""go-to"" places for pizza on my Chicago trips.The wait wasn't terrible - on a Saturday evening, we had a party of 8 call ahead to be put down on the list, and we waited for 5-10 minutes when we got there. Much better than the lines at Gino's East, and I love the fact that you can call ahead of time to get put on a ""priority list"" for faster seating when you get there.As an appetizer, we got wings which were pretty unmemorable, and a fried sampler assortment ($8.95) of mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks and jalapeno poppers. Everything was fried in the same batter, so it was pretty much a guess as to what you were actually eating until you put it in your mouth. I liked the deep fried mushrooms that I had, but I like most deep-fried things. The Cheesy Garlic Bread ($3.95) is just okay. Save your carbs for the pizza. Ditto on the salad - it was good and made us feel slightly better about carb-heavy dinner, but it was nothing to write home about.The pizza on the other hand was phenomenal. The crust was crispy and not soggy in the middle; the tomato sauce was the right proportion and the amount of cheese was just right. I loved both the pepperoni pizza and the sausage & spinach pizza that we got. I think less toppings is more when it comes to ordering, so that the toppings don't completely overwhelm the crust, tomato, and cheese. The large size is pretty generous, and being 8 girls, most people ate 1.5 slices each.The price is affordable too - we paid $25 a piece which included beer, appetizers, salad, and 2 large pizzas (split between 8 people). Would highly recommend over Lou Malnati's and Giordano's and I'm looking forward to coming back here again for more!"
"I like it, very distinctive. (Full-disclosure: I had takeout, not dine-in, so maybe fresher pizza would have given me a better experience). The burned crust wasn't quite for me, but the sauce was incredible. If you like this and live on the far north side, try Gulliver's on Howard (a very similar deep dish concept)."
"My favorite deep dish in Chicago - largely due to the crust.  There are other places closer, but when I have a craving for deep dish this beats all others.  The restaurant itself can be a little crowded, but the service is good and it's a good place to watch a game or eat before a movie.  One note is that delivery takes a while (I believe because the pies take longer than most places), but the food comes hot."
"Freaking amazing pizza. Open late night for when we roll out of Joe's, it's the perfect beer and 'za spot. Dare I say it rivals my homegrown favorite Beggars Pizza?! Their pan/deep dish is ridiculous. Pequod's is an automatic stop when we make the neighborhood."
"I went on a Saturday during a Cubs game so it wasn't packed at all and we were seated immediately. We ordered the garlic cheesy bread as an appetizer which has now become a requirement prior to the pizza. You have to order the pan pizza unless you'll be missing out. From the crispy crust to the caramelized halo of cheesy goodness!! Hands down the best pizza I've had in a while. I'm glad it's far away from my residence because if not, I'd seriously be in trouble."
"I lived in Chicago for 30ish years and not a huge fan of the chain pizza places (Giordanos, Gino's East, etc.)  Well...they're a bit overrated and these types of places serve up the fabulous Chicago Pizza.I was turned onto this place years ago and I'd have to say I frequented the Morton Grove location a few times a month, maybe every other Friday or so.  I cannot say enough AWESOME things about the pan pizza here.  Once we tried the thin crust and it just wasn't the same...it wasn't horrible, but not the same.  Reason it's not the same, being the crust that you get with the pan pizza.  You just have to try it because it's pretty much indescribable.As for this particular location, I've been here less times than the Morton Grove location but if I'm in the city, or in the area I always like to hit up this place.  It's probably a good thing I'm not so close anymore as my waistline won't take so much of a hit :)My last visit to this place was right before the lunch hour on a nice sunny Saturday afternoon...most of the place was empty when we got there and we were seated upstairs.  When we left, the place was packed full with a crowd waiting outside.  Yes...this place is that good!!!  The service and food was great as usual and I will keep coming back to this place when I'm in the area."
"The best deep dish pizza I have had. It is a local ""hole-in-the-wall"" place in Lincoln park Chicago but well worth it. If anyone wants to taste authentic deep dish pizza then this is the spot!"
"If you are looking for that old school ""pizza hut"" pan pizza experience, look no further! I kept it pretty simple and ordered the personal pepperoni pan pizza and it was pretty damn good! When it comes to pizza I am all about the crust and Pequod's crust was delicious!  It was crunchy and golden/slightly burnt which is exactly how I like it!  We also ordered fries, which were just fries, but the pizza will have me coming back.Only downside...the first time we tried to go, we made the mistake of hitting this spot up on a Friday night and the wait was 2 PLUS hours! No way, not happening, so we left.  On my second attempt we went mid-week at around 5:00 and that was much better, no wait."
"As a life-long, hardcore Lou's devotee, it's hard for me to admit that this is Chicago's best pizza. Malnati's is great, but this is truly unique and truly amazing. Service was a little off the night I went in, and the wine list is pretty bad, hence the four stars, but the crust on the pizza, the crust, man! The delicious crust is to die for."
This is great deep dish.  Pasta meat balls were average.  But for Chicago pizza this place is on the short list.  Our medium had a burnt bottom and they gladly replaced it.  We will be back!
This pizza is absolutely to die for.  The only downfall is that there is only one Pequods.  The dining in experience is a must at least once although the wait can be very long.  I usually order for pick up anytime I am in the area (I live downtown).
"Well worth the wait for dining in or delivery. Their crust is perfect, I'm not a big fan of deep dish so the fact that it is a bit thinner being a pan crust its just delish!"
Hands down the best pizza place in the entire city - and in the entire world in my opinion. The deep dish pepperoni pizza is absolutely to die for. When I bring people to Chicago this is the pizza place I take them to. Be prepared to wait a while for the pizza to come out.
"Meatball, garlic and basil...  The best!!!    Another pizza at the table had sausage and I tried a chunk on our way back to the metro... the big chucks were so good I was tempted to go back and get one to-go...  It takes45 mins to cook but as thick as it is, I understand..  The best pizza I have ever eaten... And I have eaten many!!!  Sauce is not overpowering like many places...  Lots on it, but very mild..."
"OMG that caramelized cheese! This pizza has all the makings of the familiar Chicago speciality deep dish, yet manages to be unique in a sea of ordinary. I recommend sausage and giardiniera. Expect to wait, but it is totally worth it."
"Best Deep Dish in Chicago!  If you're from STL try their ranch as your new favorite dipping sauce!  Their delivery time of 1hr/45 minutes always seems standard & to be expected, however patience is a virtue & it's 100% worth the wait!  I love getting Sausage, Spinach & Garlic Deep Dish with the slightly burnt crust it comes with & it's delicious dipped in ranch ;)"
It's worth the wait. I try to steer people here over the other well known deep dish places. Blackhawks games are usually on the TVs with the sound on.
"I am somewhat surprised that I've never tried Pequod's before...being a Chicago girl who loves pizza.  However, since I was such a stubborn Gino's East fan, I hadn't ventured over to Pequod's.  However, I visited this past weekend for a party and had such a fun time.First of all, I never would have guessed that this spot was so large.  From the outside, it looks tiny!  Don't get me wrong, considering the place was totally packed, it does still seem a bit small, but there's quite a bit of space and I would imagine if you come at an off-time, there is probably plenty of room to sit.Anyway, we had a reservation for a large crowd and we were seated in the back of the upstairs.  While I wish we had had a larger table instead of a bunch of small round ones, it turned out to be pretty comfortable for us.  Service was attentive and great and we didn't really wait for anything.  Considering we had such a large group, I was impressed with their success at managing our drinks and food orders.We had some fried appetizers and salads.  Everything was delicious and nicely made and fresh.  And on to the pizza....I thought it was great.  Being a devotee of other Chicago pizzas, I wasn't prepared to like this one so much.  I was quite happy with the sausage deep dish.  While I love crust, and this didn't have quite as much as I would have liked, the flavor was really great - crispy and definitely held up well to the cheese/sausage/sauce quantities.  The sauce was great, not too sweet and nice and hot!  Sausage was delicious and there was a nice sauce to cheese ratio.Overall, a great spot.  I would definitely return for the good food and service.  Food - 5Service - 4Atmosphere - 3Bathrooms - 3Value - 5"
"Unique pizza. Not always predictable, particularly if doing delivery, but usually pretty delicious no matter."
"Chicago deep dish is the same everywhere, load it with bunch of cheese and tomato sauce. But this place has great value when compared to Lous or Giardinos"
"Excellent Pizza. The crust is not what I associate with ""authentic"" Chicago deepdish pizza but it its very good. Surpise good places get busy and require a wait....... and deepdish pizza takes a while to cook! Be patient its worth the wait."
Top 2 pizza places in Chicago. They don't skimp on toppings unlike some of the other pizza places. Definitely worth the price and wait every time.
Came to Chi-town for vacation so naturally we needed to get some deep dish pizza! Pequod's Pizza was recommended to us by our Uber & it was INCREDIBLE. Noel had awesome recommendations & really took the experience to 11. James Dirt was also super accommodating & helpful. 10/10 overall! Next time I am in Chicago I will be back!!
"This pizza is nothing short of amazing!My friend and I were shopping in the area and decided to stop in for an early dinner one night.  Luckily, because it was around 4PM we were seated right away.  My friend had been there before so she recommended the deep dish and the fried zucchini.  We ended up getting 1 personal deep dish pizza, 1 personal thin crust pizza and fried zucchini for an appetizer.  The service was quick-- even when the restaurant started to get very busy around 5PM.  The fried zucchini was very good and held us over until the deep dish pizza was done!  When the pizza did come out it was cooked to perfection.  It's important to note that the deep dish takes significantly longer to cook so make sure to time it right when you order.I'll definitely be back.  If you don't want to have to wait I would recommend making a reservation, or calling for take-out as the restaurant itself is not very big and there is always a line by the door."
"Ridiculously amazing lunch special -personal pizza with a fountain drink for 4.95!  The cheesy and crunchy crust and generous toppings (of course at an extra charge) make the pizza one of the better pan pizzas I've ever had. The only turn offs I had related to the iced tea - it was pretty awful -super watery and just didn't taste good period. And the bathroom was very dated (small stalls, good luck to the ladies who are a little bigger boned or have bigger booties like myself) and dirty.  Otherwise, great place to eat...you may just want to hold your pee until you get home so you can avoid the bathroom!"
"Pequods's is hands down my favorite Chicago deep dish! We order take out on a semi-regular basis. The caramelized cheese crust really makes the flavor! If you're ordering peak times or weekend, expect a 90 minute wait for take out...it's worth it!"
"Was seated immediately and the staff was great and got us our beverages quick. We ordered 2 personal pan pizzas which was more than enough.Be prepared to wait around 40 minutes to get your pizza, you will understand why it took so long once you see it. I got pepperoni, hamburger and extra cheese and It was delicious. The cheese was caramelized golden brown on the sides and that's why the crust was my favorite part. The hamburger was literally a burger they cooked then cut up in big chunks and put on the pizza.Great environment and made us feel like we were where the locals were in Chicago. BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD."
"Best deep dish pizza in the city of Chicago!  Buzzing and energetic atmosphere with a great staff and service.  Splitting a deep dish with another person is ideal so it's a great date spot (especially if it's a first date because its a fun, casual spot).  Also not a bad spot to go with a group of friends to watch the Cubs or Hawks.  If you haven't been here yet, you have to give it a try."
"I'm a ny pizza snob and I still loved this place.   Great service, good beer and incredible deep dish pizza with fresh toppings.    Loved it.   For two people just get the small pie.  It's more than enough."
"I went to Riot Fest 2016 and I wanted to have chicago pizza before I went home. After doing some research, I saved this place on my phone and on my last day in Chicago, I went here and it was the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I still dream about it! I can't wait to go back to Chicago and have pequods."
"Amazing pizza! Lou Malnati's and Pequod's take my picks as the best pizza in town. My sister and I called in for reservations, and we were seated in two minutes when we arrived. We ordered a medium deep dish pizza with sausage, onions, and jalapeños. Everything was so flavorful: the toppings, the tomato sauce, etc. The caramelized crust won't be for all (more burnt than caramelized), but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. People always try to make the argument for best pizza, etc. I'll tell you straight up: neither Lou Malnati's nor Pequod's ever blew my mind, but it's still well worth the visit. Comparing Lou Malnati's and Pequod's is a different story. If you want a nice sit-down restaurant, go to Lou Malnati's in the Loop. If you want a bar to watch a sports game in a nice college-feel area, go to Pequod's. The pizza in both places is fantastic."
Deep-crust-pizza-is-not-real-pizza-but-god-damn-this-pizza-is-good!Aww man that was difficult to say :/New Yorkers gon' hate
I love this pizza. It is different from deep dish and thin crust. Very good and well deserved to be on best pizza of Chicago list.
"Excellent Chicago style pizza. Better than the other I've had while visiting here. The way the crust is caramelized onto the iron skillet is so crunchy and delicious and they've got it down to a science. I was here with another couple and of course the men chose sausage, and the gals chose basil. I'm so glad we tried the sausage, as it was truly amazing. As they say ""you can't beat our meat"" and boy are they right."
The BEST pizza in Chicago. Don't go to the tourist traps. Go here. Get a thin crust pizza. Trust me.
Was told to come here from a friend while visiting Chicago! wow this pizza is amazing!!!!!!!! Def go here if you want REAL Chicago style deep dish pizza
"Let me start off with stating that this place would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the ridiculous prices to add on simple items like mushrooms. I always go here when I'm in Chicago. Yes it is hyped up, but I find that the quality of the toppings and cheese are much better than Lou's IMO.The crust is a bit softer, but that's how I like my pizza....I mean, pie. It's a PIE. I think that's important to note. But yes, I added 5 toppings? Maybe 6. Basically made ours a supreme and it was $50!!!! WHAT? But knowing myself, I'll be back again regardless. It really is something you just have to try. You may like it, you may not. But what I can guarantee is that you'll be impressed with the serving size. No one can beat that 1 inch + deep dish slice."
"Mouthgasm. They aren't bragging when they speak highly of their crust--it's the damn truth. Crispy and seasoned in all the right places (even in the deepest depths of the bottom of the pizza), it was hands down the most favorite part of the entire pie.However, the sauce and meats did not disappoint either. They, too, were incredibly flavored in their own aspects, and both upheld the overall complex flavors of the pizza throughout its entirety.We came in on a Friday evening, Valentine's Day nonetheless, expecting a ridiculous wait. Surprise! The girls in the party were greeted with roses and we were escorted upstairs, down the hall, and into a nice private booth in the corner almost immediately. Service was a bit far and few in between, but our appetizers and pizza came out in a reasonable amount of time.The appetizer combo had an assortment of various fried & breaded items, adequate for our party of 5, but because we were starving, we had wished it came with a few more items than it did. It came with mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, zucchini slices and mushrooms.We shared a large pie amongst the 5 of us, and slices themselves are decently large. I ate 1.5 slices myself. I could've eaten 2, but was feeling shy and lady-like. The only other complaint I heard within our table was that we wished there had been more cheese in the pizza. Regardless, a very minor complaint, and overall, Pequod's was a winner."
My number one spot for deep dish pizza in town. About 15 min drive from downtown Chicago but definitely worth the drive.
"I've only eaten in once for lunch and the experience was sub par.The dozen or so time's I've ordered take out, the pizza has been worth the 20 minute drive.  It's my favorite Chicago pizza even if the staff is a bit young and under trained."
"I'm not sure I can put into words... just how amazing this place is. The crazy part is, this wasn't going to be our stop for the day. We were trying a different pizza place... they said the wait was 3 hours, and we just couldn't wait that long. Pequod's got us seated in under 20 minutes and what followed was possibly the best pizza experience I've ever had. The pizza was fabulous. Pan pizza, caramelized cheese around the crust, and the flavor was out of this world. We will be returning to eat here again, wouldn't think twice about it. Also, the staff was very friendly."
Have to admit that this place knows what it is doing when it comes to pizza! I've had the big name deep dish pizzas around Chicago and none of them compare! Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this amazing pizza!!!!
Very good pizza if you like caramelized crust (it is a bit different from the normal deep dish). Only reason for the 4 star is because I thought it was too much bread for me compared to more cheese you get and the other deep dish pizzerias
"Probably my favorite Chicago pizza place!Not exactly deep dish, but it certainly different from any ordinary pizza place. What makes Pequod's pizza awesome is their crust, which is buttery, garlicky and perfectly crisped/caramelized... yum! The pizza ingredients are also always so fresh too!This place has two stories, first floor seems small, but once you go to the second floor, there's a lot of tables, the three times I've been, I never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.Located in Lincoln Park, so if you're visiting the city, just know that this isn't located in the loop so you'll most likely have to drive or take the El(subway). This place is a must for Chicago style pizza!"
Deep dish and thin crust are both still the best in Chicago! And everyone knows Chicago has the best pizza in the U.S.  I've been coming here for more than a decade and the quality has been consistent throughout.  Always made with plenty of fresh toppings and a perfectly baked snappy crust.  I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
"Delicious Chicago pizza, tied for my favorite Deep Dish. The caramelized crust is heavenly. Sometimes there's a horrendous wait on weekends so come early. The buffalo wings are yummy too. And Pequod's delivers!"
"Let's start with the good stuff, and most important part of the review. The pizza - always delicious, so tasty, and the crust is unbeatable. For the occasional craving for deep dish, this is a definitely a favorite. Be warned you'll be salivating and impatiently waiting while your pizza is cooked to perfection.Minus one star for service - Placing your order for pizza doesn't necessarily ensure they actually place the order. We ended up waiting for about an hour for a pie, half an hour of which could have been avoided if they had started baking when we placed the order. Also, our server never asked if we wanted appetizers, drinks, etc, or came by our table during our wait. Very disorganized in that sense. I understand it's a busy place but not checking on a table for almost an hour is no bueno. That being said, the staff was friendly."
"I'm always reluctant to leave five star reviews for my favorite restaurants because I'd still like to be able to get a table when I visit - but Pequod's is already a madhouse on most nights so I doubt one more glowing review is going to change much. I love eating here - the atmosphere is old-school pizzeria and the food is amazing. I was on the Gino's East bandwagon for the first few years I lived in the city, but I always direct people to Pequod's now when they are looking for what I consider Chicago's best deep dish. I wish I liked sports so I had more of a reason to stay in here longer than my meal warrants (and possibly order another meal eventually) but all the screens with hockey, football or whatever really doesn't distract from the meal. They can accommodate very large groups - but make sure to give them a heads up. Also we love the giardiniera as a pizza topping. Burnt cheese on the crust?! So good!!"
"Very delicious pizza, very reasonably priced, good service.Beer selection was so-so but overall it was a great Chicago deep dish pizza experience."
"For my money, this is the best ""Chicago style"" pizza in the city. Caramelized crust, great sauce and toppings, gooey melty cheese. This place is nostalgic for me. While visiting Chicago before I lived here, I heard Pequad's was the best deep dish around. I was staying in Bridgeport and had no idea how to use Chicago public transportation, so it took forever to get to Lincoln Park, and it was raining. It was all worth it when we ordered a pizza and a pitcher of beer. That weekend I decided to move to Chicago and put down roots. Every time I've come back since it's been easier to get here but the pizza has been just as good. If I could change anything, I would expand the beer list."
"Damn, do I love pizza!Pequods is so amazing! Get their pan, otherwise you're wasting your time. Everything is delish, I drool thinking about their pizza. There is usually a wait for delivery, but rest assured it's worth it! If you're dining in get some cheesy bread and wings (also great when delivered!). You don't come here for atmosphere, you come for 'za. But damn, is it good! Worth the wait!!"
Awesome pizza!!! My family out of town goes everytime and loves it. The staff is great! Its always very packed and long wait but very worth it. You want great pizza a much visit.
"What! The pizza is what makes a spot. And this spot is done correctly. I am one of those ""deep dish pizza super snobs who really only eats traditional deep dish and from other competitors and now I am a believer that there is way more out there than I thought. Oh wow, are you really going to tell me that this is heaven? I was floored with the place, but the pizza took me to another level with its crispy edges of cheese. Oh was I going to HELL for enjoying this way too much. I started off of course with a salad, that actually had cheese in the shape of a whale, my friend told me that it is the whale from one of the books, I forget which one. I am hearing that it is hard to get a seat on Fridays and Saturdays, but we came on a Sunday afternoon and it was really not bad. I am one to admit, this pizza really took me there. To the moon and back! Check them and you tell me if I was wrong."
"This is hands down the best pizza in Chicago!... Quite honestly the best pan pizza I've ever had. Let's start with, this pizza can blow your mind! It's not like any other crust. The crust is most def what makes it unique. It's a Caramelized crust, or basically pizza baked in an old seasoned black pan and burns the cheese on top. Whatever way you put it, it's delicious! Simple is def better, pepperoni is where it's at!If you want a good appetizer, try the Jalapeño poppers. They are pretty good! The reason for only 4 stars is a few things, all of which is to be expected with such a high traffic/ crazy busy restaurant but still worth noting! It is so inconsistent there! I am a frequent carry out customer (at least every other Sunday-hey like I said, it's my favorite!) Sometimes the pizza is hot hot hot, sometimes It's not! (not not!) Sometimes it's super cheesy, sometimes it's super saucey and other days, it's dry! You just don't really know. You may walk in on time and it's done or sometimes you end up waiting an additional 20 minutes. It's a guessing game for sure!Overall, just go! Order it simple, extra saucey and enjoy the deliciousness!"
"BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO.Seriously, don't go anywhere else, only to Pequod's."
"We checked out 4 deep dish pizza places during our visit to Chicago for the weekend... Peqoud's, Giordano's,  and Lou Malnati's...  i can honestly say that Peqoud's had the best crust out of all of them... it definitely separated from the rest. The pizza was really good... but the only reason ibdidnt five them 5 stars was because if the appetizers and the presentation of the appetizers. My wife and i got the Jalapeño poppers... wow, such a small serving and just thrown into a plate with the dipping sauce. Embarrassing."
"Hard to top this place when it comes to deep dish.  Had it for game 7 of the 2016 World Series- so maybe its just referred joy...In all truth, Pequod's is worth the wait if you are in the mood for deep dish."
I've never been to this location but the original up north is one of the best pizzas I've ever had   (on a side street off of dempster)
Fantastic place great lunch specials. Christmas Ale is great!  Didn't know they had an upstairs sitting area!!! Food came quick love the pan pizza. Servers were nice too!!
"It all depends on my mood, I guess, but between this place and AoP (get it?) I have trouble deciding which is the best in this neck of my woods.  I like alot of sauce so I'll always order extra since I don't think they put enough on it for my taste."
Caramelized crust is what sets this place apart from the others. It's the bomb!
After living in Chicago my whole life I have a good idea of what Deep dish pizza is supposed to be.......This is it! The caramelized crust was to die for. The pizza was very good was it the best no but definitely one of the best! The place had a cozy atmosphere with minimal deco but I liked it. Average service and wait time for a pizza joint. But if your in the city and you looking for that quintessential Chicago Pizza Place this is it.
Best deep dish in Chicago ask for extra cheese and sauce and you will not be disappointed!
"I absolutely loved this place! I love deep dish pizza and compared to other restaurants like Lou Malnatis and Giordanos, Pequods definitely wins. The place was pretty packed, probably because of the bears game or the fact that it was Halloween, but we called ahead to make sure they had a table and were seated immediately! The service was quick! I was really impressed! Can't wait to go back again. Definitely recommend this place!"
"First off, I love pizza just as much as the next man and Pequods is no different. The crust is good, the sauce is good, the pizza is good. The portions are good, the apps are good, the beer is good. Most of all I like the place with the Chicago sports vibe all over and even on the workers uniform.Everytime I frequent Pequods I leave in a pizza coma and that's a good problem. They would really win my heart over and the fifth star if they had bacon. Canadian bacon? Wheretheydothat@?"
"This review is for a recent visit on 7/8/16 at 12:30am. The restaurant was quite busy for a late Thursday / early Friday but the service definitely met expectations. Our waitress was extremely friendly and assertive while taking our orders. She seemed exhausted since it was near closing, but her customer service wasn't interfered by her exhaustion. As always, the food came out to be delicious and just as expected. The appetizer sampler is a must have for anyone that wants to try a variety of items. To top it off, our deep dish pizza did a great job of satisfying our cravings. Will be returning soon!"
I'm obsessed with their deep dish. The best I've tried so far!I traveled from the south side of Chicago just to try it out and I'm extremely impressed. Will most definitely be back sometime soon. Worth it
"I went to Chicago to experience deep dish pizza and while it is good, it is not anywhere near as good as NYC pizza.  In terms of deep dish for Chicago, two locations stood out to me; this and Lou Malnati's.  This is hands down better than Lou's but both are good.  If you are staying in the loop, Malnati's would be a great alternative, but if you don't mind traveling, go to Pequod's.  Pequod's had a much better vibe to it and I didn't feel like I was at a chain restaurant.  The service was a little slower here, but it was worth the wait."
"Tied for my favorite pizza place in Chicago. Fighting with Coalfire for #1. But they couldn't be more different, so I think it's okay to have two favorites.Why do I love Pequod's? 1-They do take reservations!2-One piece generally fills me up so I have leftovers for the next few days3-The crispy edge on the pizza! Sooooo good!4-Cheese! They totally get this right!I've only had dine-in pizza from here, so I can't review their deliveries.The staff is always super friendly and on top of refills. I love that this place is a good family restaurant. Almost seems suburban!"
Admittedly biased since I love deep dish...The place was packed and we were ushered to a stairway in the back of the building. Much to my surprise there was a second level which was also packed.  I loved every type of pizza they offered here.
"This place has been on my ""Pizza Wish List"" for years.  Finally had a chance to try one of their deep dish pizzas yesterday.The crust is similar to Lou Malnati's.  The sauce is much sweeter, you can really taste the basil in the sauce  The cheese is nice and smooth.Overall, a decent pie.Warning: ""caramelized crust"" = blackened/charred/burned on the edges."
"Went on a busy Saturday night last weekend and the wait was ridiculous. We ended up squeezing in at the bar and ordered drinks and our pizzas. The drinks were delicious; definitely some of the best Patron margaritas I've ever had. After about 40 minutes our pizzas came out and they were huge, hot and fresh. We had deep dish sausage and pepperoni. They were very bread-y, but the sauce and cheese was plentiful and flavorful. After two slices I was stuffed and satisfied. It didn't take the top spot on my list for Chicago deep dish, but it's a pretty close second."
"Like any other normal American visiting Chicago, I wanted some pizza. I wanted some good pizza. I wanted what the locals eat, and I wanted a lot of it. This is my experience at Pequod's... it's a bit of a read, but it should give an idea of what you can expect. Hey, I don't eff around with Yelp reviews like other goons who say, ""Mm. Tasty. Go here."" and call it a review... nuh-uh. Here's a tale, my friends...First of all, if it weren't for the big fat five star rating above this review, you'd probably think I absolutely hated Pequod's until the end of it. On a Saturday night at around 7:30 or so, I came with a party of four and made a reservation: ""Your wait will be about forty-five minutes to an hour."" After walking back outside and seeing about twenty people sitting around, I knew that was probably a lie, but whatever. I'll wait.Forty-five minutes go by and I decide it'd be best to order my pizza before getting our table -- done and done: a large pan pizza with sausage and pepperoni. Another twenty minutes later, I go back in after noticing a party of six that got there way after us got a table. I was about to freak my shit, but then I figured they had a reservation. Still, a little while longer, there was a group of four that got to Pequod's soon after we did that got seated. At that point, I went inside and asked how much longer, and they said ""There are about four tables in front of you, so maybe about twenty minutes?"" I was so hungry at this point that I wasn't even mad ... and I get mega cranky when I'm hungry. After walking outside and telling my group that the wait would be even *longer*, they started walking away. After they got about a block away (I was still in line. No way in hell was I going to just leave after already waiting over an hour), we got buzzed in. Fucking FINALLY. I assume that the reservation people dun goofed their shit and overlooked my party, and got us a table ASAP before we left.We got sat down in the far back corner in the right of the restaurant, which worked well with me. Pequod's is a pretty tiny place, so being away from all the elbows is probably for the best. To get some food in our stomachs, we got the mozerella sticks, which were said to be a ""must buy"" from some reviewers here. I will say, I would definitely agree with that had the cheese been more melted. The breading on them is great, and the marinara dipping sauce is perfect.After about ten to fifteen minutes of MORE waiting, our pre-ordered pizza came. What a work of art. Huge pieces of sausage basically gave the equivalent of one full link per slice, and there was a generous amount of pepperoni. Pequod's doesn't skimp like some other places -- there's nothing worse than paying over $2 for an additional topping and getting only a few pieces.This may be the best pizza I've ever had... as good as the toppings and sauce were, the crust truly makes Pequod's stand out. Chewy, crispy, burnt (well, they call it caramelized)... damn, I could eat this just about any day. It's rare that I, or anybody that I talk to, can excuse such an excessive wait time no matter how awesome the food is, but this is an exception.Altogether, I probably waited about 90 minutes until I got in and ate my pizza. If I hadn't ordered my pizza beforehand, it would probably have been two full hours. In the future, I'll *have* to call ahead and make a reservation, because as unbelievably delicious as this pizza is, I have a hard time waiting over an hour at a restaurant.Pequod's doesn't exactly have what many people associate as ""deep dish"", ""Chicago-style"" pizza, but it does have an unreal pan pizza that will satisfy your tastebuds... legendary."
"Best freaking deep dish around. The crust itself is airy and awesome and Carmelized (what they are known for)! Not a bit soggy. Layered with the perfect amount of cheese with your choice in toppings and probably some of the best marinara on top. The breaded mushrooms with the homemade ranch was also amazing and the zucchini slices weren't bad either. But prepare yourself, the wait is long but you can call ahead and do a seat reserve to move your name ahead on the list. You'll still have to wait but they just bought fillipos two doors down and will give you 10% off at pequods. Get the personal pizzas with a group - more crust!"
"Hands down the best for thicker crust pizza.  Make no mistake, this IS NOT deep dish.  It's pan pizza with a perfectly caramelized cheese melted on the crust.  Great toppings and sauce as well.  My fave in the city.  Lines can get crazy so call ahead and order take out."
Best pizza in Chicago. I want to rub it all over my body but instead I just end up putting It into my mouth. The wait can be long sometimes but it's worth it
"Very good stuff.  Sauce was a little sweeter than I prefer, but heavy cheese makes you forget about it.  I'm not a fan of Chicago style pie honestly, but this was very representative in my opinion.  A bit heavy on the crust.  I had been warned to be prepared to wait, but we waltzed in at 6 pm on a Wednesday and went straight to a table."
So damn good.  Best Chicago style pizza in town. Their traditional style is really good too.  The staff is friendly but not intrusive too.  A must have every time I'm in Chicago.
"This place is pizza heaven. My college buddies who live in Chicago told me to eat there and they didn't steer me wrong. The crust was phenomenal. It's NOT your Chicago Deep Dish but that might make it more special. It's a tall darkened and caramelized crust that tastes great. I had sausage, pepperoni, and jalapeños and the meats were tender as could be. This is hands down one of the best and affordable pizza places I've visited, ever. You can't beat their small pizza special. I'll be back more times to come when I visit Chicago."
First time trying Hawaiian pizza and also this new place. I'm a stuff pizza kinda girl my goto place is Lou's but let me tell you this changed my world the crust is amazing just the way i like it brunt and crispy it's not as buttery as Lou's but it's amaze balls. I will def goo again and get a large deep dish instead of a personal size and re do the Hawaiian  pizza . And lets not talk about the sausage it was so good not your typically you find are you local pizza place. Can't wait to go back also the bartender JACK was great host also tried beer we never did before.
"Whether you live in Chicago or are just visiting this is by far and away the best pizza in the city.  Make sure you get the carmelized crust.  You cannot go wrong.  Service is good, apps are just OK but you are there for the pizza."
Tessa served us a thick pan pizza. The.best  it was huge it was phenomenal it was the greatest!!! The pizza was fresh and delicious  Chitown favorite!!!!
"SUPERB pan pizza.  I always order half mushroom/onion and half mushroom/onion sausage and it really is the best.  I also love the parmesan cheese baked into the crust.  This place does tend to get crowded if dining in, so make sure you get there early (or even carry out) to beat the rush."
I would wait 5 hours for this pizza it's that good. Give me all the caramelized onion goodness you have. #carbsforlife
"Deep Dish Pepperoni, Sausage, mushrooms, bell pepper, garlic, and basilThe pizza was awesome. Good flavor and the toppings were very fresh. Other deep dishes I have had are always loaded with to much tomato sauce over the topping. The amount Pequod's had was perfect. The wait to get seated for 1 hour and then 45 mins for the pizza was a little more than we expected."
"Visited from California, this place was recommended  by two different people! It was definitely worth the trek out of downtown for amazing deep dish! Sausage and pepperoni! The crust suprising.. but  might be some of the best pizza in my life. Takes a little while depending on how busy it is for the pizza, but a beer and a appetizer  will  make for one magic meal"
"Pequod's was literally the first stop on our weekend Chicago trip and the absolute perfect way to kick it off. We came at the suggestion of a knowledgeable foodie friend who encouraged us to try an alternative to the tourist-y Giordano's and other larger brands. We arrived ~12pm on a Sat, and there was ample seating available. From reading reviews, I feared that it would take a long time for our pizzas to cook, but it took maybe 30 minutes max for the main features to arrive. We passed some of the wait time with the Pequod's salad--I thought it turned out to be amusingly like a pizza salad because it has cheese and pepperoni on it. We ordered two medium deep dish pizzas, one with pepperoni and onion, and one with spinach and mushroom, the latter I had a heavy hand in designing since those are the best veggies paired with ooey gooey cheese. I think I need to expand my vocabulary because ""yummy"" doesn't quite do the flavors justice. Pequod's signature caramelized cheese is a winner, especially if you like burn in a good toasty way. One interesting aspect of their pizzas is that the crust is more crunchy, or crouton-like rather than bread-like. While we chatted animatedly while waiting for the pies, we became quieter upon encountering their deliciousness firsthand and focusing our energies on gobbling slice after slice. Soon our party of five (including three guys with large appetites) were satiated, plus we had a slice leftover. Best of all, it was quite an inexpensive meal at ~$12 per person, considering we got a salad in addition to pizza and that we were in a big city, where I automatically assume everything is pricier. By the time we left the two floors of the restaurant were pretty full, so I believe Pequod's serves excellent true Chicago deep dish pizza more appealing to locals. The only problem with the experience is that now I crave Pequod's when I'm back at home. But I might just make the four hour drive to get it."
"This is Chicago best pizza...get the Pan Pizza, it's worth the wait.  Forget about Lou's, and Uno, and Giordano's... if you're coming to Chicago this is the place to check out.I've been coming here for years and it's always good. I've never been disappointed. Beer selection ranges from the basics to good enough number of premium options, although not many. The wine offerings are actually pretty decent given the ambience which emotes the expectation of Sutter Home or Beringer-only.While the decor could use some updating, I think keeping things the way they have been since the beginning gives the restaurant a certain classic charm. At first glance you think you're walking into a dive bar that's going to smell old and musty, but they keep things clean and fresh.Try a house or Pequod's salad as an appetizer too.Overall 5 stars for food, service ambience and overall experience with a True Chicago Pizzeria."
"Anton Ego from Ratatouille: ""If I don't love it, I don't swallow.""That was me with Chicago deep dish. At least until my last visit to the windy city. For Ego it was Remy's ratatouille. For me it was Pequod's.When Pequod's was first recommended by local friends, I hmmed and hawwed. They said ""no no, this ain't Uno's or Gino's East, this one packs a punch."" They mentioned the hour-long line of locals. Then they mentioned the caramelized cheese crust ring. Caramelized cheese crust ring?Pequod's delivered that punch. Pequod's delivered that hour-long line. It delivered rich sauce and flavorful crust with enough crunch at the bottom. Equally doughy, this pan pizza's crust is dense and puffy and way richer than regular deep dish, no stale airy dryness. The sausage is great, spicy and hearty. Pepperoni and onion hold up well. The cheese is there but expect less than other Chi pies. And then came that caramelized cheese crust. Everyone used a different method but we all had the same goal: JAM! IT! IN! And when we did, it was the end of Ratatouille for me.. 1st grade book-it pins and the TMNT arcade game's in the corner!""Not every Chicago place can cook great pie. But great pie does come from Chicago.."""
"Some of the best deep dish EVER! One of our favorite spots for pizza over Lou's, over gino's, giordanos, you name it. The crust is best part."
Ordered take out with my friends. The wait is always very long but was worth it. They could just sell the crust and it would still be amazing.
"My first deep dish experience... decent enough. The pizza wasn't bad in any way and I was satisfied, but was in no way blown away. Our server did her job only that- didn't attend to us right away and wasn't particularly friendly."
"THIS is what I think of when I want Chicago deep dish pizza! On my first visit, my friends took us here for pizza. I left VERY satisfied with the choice and VERY full. Service was excellent with our party of (15ish?). When they took us in, I noticed how small the dining floor was while the hostess escorted us to our table. I thought, ""Uh.. I don't see any tables available."" Then she took us up stairs where there was a lot more seating. Ah. So there is room for a big party.Fast forward, I came back to visit again 9months later. This time we asked my girlfriend's local friends where they eat pizza. Three of us went on this visit. Three of us were not very pleased with the suggestion. I decided that we HAD to do Chicago deep dish pizza properly & came here the next night. Case in point. If you want deep dish pizza, go to Pequod's. Hands down. No questions asked. Just do it!"
"Pequod's was phenomenal from the start. We came here during lunch hour and despite the time of day we were able to be seated in 15 min. I'm a huge hockey fan, so I loved the primarily Blackhawks themed bar (among other sports) The waitress was satisfactory. Now as for the pizza.....lets start from the top. The prices here are reasonably priced if you share a pie with someone. You won't be breaking your wallet unlike some of the other deep dish restaurants in town. Unlike other deep dish pizza joints, Pequods toppings are actually on the top rather than deep under the sauce and/or cheese. This was great for my girlfriend who is a vegetarian since she was able to see what was on top of the pizza. In the past, we split pizza's and she would get a piece of pepperoni on her side which at times, unsettled her. However since we saw what was on top of the pizza, it made for a more pleasant experience. The sauce struck a perfect balance of being sweet with just enough tomatoey sourness, for a nice balance. Very hot. The cheese was decent mozzarella, nothing that stands out but FAR from bad. It was good. The toppings were also high quality and tasted as they should. Now for the crust....I think most people who visit Pequods know about their signature crust, and I must say its just aa delicious, crunchy, greasy, oily, salty, and tasty as it looks in pictures. SO GOOD. What the pictures show really are accurate for what you think it would taste like. This is a good winter pizza (though anytime is good) because it is doughy, but in a stomach warming hearty sort of way that fits cold weather. It's also a cold-weather pizza because it'd taste good with a pitcher of beer and Hawks game on tv. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in Chicago. Five stars."
Bomb pizza! Kinda reminds of pizza huts pan pizza the way the crust is. Highly recommend!
Enjoy their take on pizza. I prefer the Morton grove location because of parking easiness but both sites provide quality tasting pizza.Great time and great food.
Amazing! Came from my friend's (who is a local) recommendation and truly the best deep dish I have ever had. Coming from California it was also quite affordable for what you get!
Pequod's Pizza is my favorite place for PAN pizza. It is so delicious and worth the wait every time. You won't regret a visit to Pequod's!
"One of the best pizza joints in the city. May not be the healthiest, but hey , it's pizza. Want healthy ? Go someplace & get a salad."
"This review is so long over due... I was visiting Chicago with some friends and we just had to try the signature deep dish pizza a few hours prior to our flight. Otherwise, how would the trip be considered complete!? The service was wonderful. I found the waitress to be very welcoming and helpful when it came to deciding what to order. When the pizza came, I was very impressed by the size of the pizza and amount of cheese and topping that sat on top. The pizza was fresh and hot out of the oven. I remember watching in awe with the bubbling cheese and hearing the satisfying sizzling coming from the pan. The waitress sliced the pie and the rest is history. I had left overs at the airport with the intention of bringing this back home to eat but all that was left was crumbs by the time my flight landed back in New York..."
"-IMPORTANT NOTE: avoid the temptation to order an appetizer to fill the 45 minute cook time.  It's worth the anticipatory wait!! -  Amazing pizza, long waits (for a table and at the table), and one of the top pies in Chicago.  Not sure if it's a ""deep dish"" in the traditional sense, certainly not ""stuffed"" (though you will be), maybe more of a ""pan pizza"" on steroids.  The edge of the crust is magically caramelized, which is awesome on the first piece, from there it loses its structure.  Massive amounts of toppings.  Seriously, you need to try this place."
"Yes, the wait can be insanely long, between getting seated and then the pizza actually arriving. But basically any deep dish pizza takes awhile (45 mins at least) so that's to be expected. I guess if you're used to ""regular"" pizza cook time, this would be a bit of a shock. So...don't come here if you're in a hurry. They bought the bar next door and you can get 10% off your Pequod's order with your bar receipt, so there's a perfect place to wait to be seated. Take advantage! The pizza itself is delicious. I love the carmelized crust; definitely sets Pequod's apart from the other Chicago pizza places. It's a small place that has a friendly, neighborhood feel to it, even though it's insanely popular, and I enjoy that vibe. A visit here is a must for any deep dish fan!"
"Deep dish and deeply in love!I have no clue how I have not been here yet but I made my arrival!! The pizza my friend and I ordered was a veggie lovers delight! We asked for green peppers, onions, mushrooms and jalapeno peppers.  The sauce was perfect! Not too tangy or sweet and the toppings were toppling over perfectly!  The best part of the pizza was the crispy carmelized cheesy crust!I wish there could be a whole pizza made just of that crispy crust!It seems the place is crowded any day of the week since I was there on a random Tuesday night and word to the wise preorder your pizza before arrival to avoid the torturous wait for that mouthwatering slice of pie!I absolutely love love love this place and can't wait to go back for the lunch special!"
Great pizza! Had it at 2:00am and thought it was way better than Giordano's! Pequod's is great!
This place is a bit of a trek from downtown Chicago but it is totally worth it! This was our first stop in Chicago and we were not disappointed by their deep dish pizza. We got the special which includes a pint of beer and a personal sized deep dish pizza for $4.95.Note: The personal sized pizza is enough for 2 people.Hands down the best bang for your buck.
"As far as all the big-name deep-dish pizza places that go, Pequod's is the my favorite. Sauce - on point.Crust - perfect level of crispy.Everything else - thebomb.com"
"Visiting from Seattle- and told to go here by both locals and tourists. Pequod's is exactly what I was hoping it would be- delish classic deep dish pizza!WOWEE!!! Worth every calorific bite! Come hungry, but be prepared for wait. Tables usually have a waitlist and the pizza itself takes about 45min to cook up.But if you are patient the reward it high!Well worth finding our way from our Magnificent Mile hotel out to the burbs for this awesome pizza and some local Chitown beers."
"Wow! Great pizza! Highly recommend if you are in the Chicago area, it's a bit far to get to from downtown but definately worth an uber ride for this deep dish style pizza."
"Pequod's is great Chicago pizza.  Tasty pizza with seemingly fresh ingredients.  Lively, fun atmosphere.  Attentive, friendly service.  It is more of a pan pizza though than full-out deep dish.  Really the only drawback is the wait for a table. I wouldn't suggest sitting at the bar because that area gets so crazily packed, it's like a Wal-Mart on Black Friday. People are throwing 'bows and jostling for position like there's no tomorrow.  But if you come prepared to wait for a table, there's no worries.Bottom line, Pequod's is amazing. If you live in the area, this should be a regular haunt. If you're visiting, it's a nice alternative change-up to the bigger deep dish players."
"Out of towner review*Came here with my friend who lives in the Lincoln park area. She said this is her favorite pizza place. I thought the crowd was due to it being the weekend of the Chicago marathon, but my friend said its always pretty crowded. We were a group of 6 but we were seated right away with reservations. The burnt crust was really good to me, but my sister was not a fan. My boyfriend also said the pizza was too heavy for him and he had major food coma afterwards.Overall, I would say its delicious :) I would come back if I am ever back in Chicago."
"Great pizza, this is my go to place for out of town visitors that want to try Chicago deep dish. I like thats its outside of downtown area and visitors can see how chicago looks outside of the hustle and bustle downtown"
"Deep thoughts are better but is deep pizza dish really better? Alas may be ill equipped or unwilling to submit my answer to this, but Pequod's really helps promote the case for deep-dish. Walk in and it is what one expects a bar, booth tables and a bit dim so one could try to pass it as romantic. Deep dish pizza's come in Small Medium and Large. A Large cheese starts at 15.99 and toppings are a bit steep at $2.50 each. After a decent wait it came, caramelized cheese at the ends, sauce on top and laden with cheese and toppings. What impressed me was the use of spinach as a moisture barrier between the crust and the sauce and cheese. However the sauce was a bit bland, luckily the red pepper, oregano and cheese on the table helped remedy this issue. Garlic powder would have been nice. Overall for Chi town pizza this is my choice."
"We were seated promptly in the open-window restaurant.We ordered drinks. The mixed drinks were so-so.Food: Deep Dish sausage, black olive, & giardinera.The red sauce is sweet but tasty.Toppings are fresh and the sausage is awesome.The crust is fluffy and crisp all at the same time.The caramelized crust on the edge is fantastic.We were served by three different people.Servers were friendly and responded to our needs in a timely fashion.I recommend the deep dish here. I am not really a deep dish kind of girl, but this deep dish is a must.Bike parking out front."
"If you have not put Peaquod's pan pizza & their delectable warm, flaky, buttery crust into your mouth yet & you live in Chicago: you should be ashamed of yourself! Even if they don't deliver to your area, make the trip to the scary north side, and eat at Peaquod's. It will change your life forever! So, what's on your agenda?"
"OMG I AM OBSESSED! BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO!!!!!!!!!It's seriously so amazing! Every time I go there it's super packed, but let me tell you it is definitely worth waiting for!! Everyone in Chicago must go here at least once!"
THE CRUST.Tourists should avoid Giordano's and have the best deep dish pizza at Pequod's.
Tremendous pizza long wait but well worth it. U need to plan on spending along time waiting but the pizza is off the charts. Caramelized crust is something u must experience because words will never explain the true eating experience. Garlic is a must get with your other toppings. Can't wait to go back.
"Not a deep dish fan, but this place has amazing burnt crust deep dish pizza. A little pricey and delivery waits could be long but worth the wait."
Simply the best pan-ish style pizza hands down. The pie is so full of flavor with the right combination of cheese and toppings along with the traditional cheese/baked outer crust. Remember - while thin crust is on the menu - do not order it - always go for their famous Pan
"Pequods is not a competitor to Malnatti's, Gino's, uno's.  Pequods has their own thing going.  It's not exactly that different from the aforementioned kings of chicago deep dish, but it is.  It's unique, and qualitatively very good.In your deep dish quests, pequods is a must try, as for some it will be the best, others will never like any more than Malnatti's.Also, please don't even mention giordano's."
No pizza I ever ate can match up to the deep dish here. Don't bother trying any other deep dish in Chicago or the world.
"Qtr slice, half a slice, whole slice ay!!! Yeahhh (Gucci mane voice). Seriously the best pizza in chicago. Deep dish is slap your momma good. I usually go with the classic. Great thing is if you call ahead they can put your name on the list and start your pizza. It's worth the wait and they have alcohol. Nice little movie and dinner spot. Pepperoni and sausage is Brackin!!! Eat up its delicious and yummy. Really great for Netflix and food coma."
"Okay, I'm one of the biggest pizza fans I know. I don't discriminate against crusts, I love all types, despite the people that love to hate on the Chicago deep dish. So when my sister suggested Pequod's I was ready to go. I heard the wait was pretty long, but we went at 5 and we had no wait. Our party of 5 was put in a pretty tiny half-circle booth, that was my main complaint, we barely had any elbow room. However, this place is pretty good. The crust is the best part in my opinion, it's basically coated with this baked, crispy, caramelized cheese, which I adore. The sauce was really good as well, though I think slightly more bland than some of the Chicago-style competitors. Overall, I really enjoyed this place. The service was great, the pizza was great, though I'm torn over whether it gets best Chicago-style for me. You have to give it a try though, if not for the crust alone!"
"I've been eating great pizza for over 40 years, so I can safely say that I've had most styles and pizzas all around - Chicago, NYC, central IL, Boston, New England, Jersey, Brooklyn, California (), Italy.... And THIS is literally the BEST pan pizza I have ever had. Wow."
The Best in Chicago! Pizza made perfect . The garlic salad dressing amazing . Fried Zucchini perfect crunchy outside ! I recommend this to all my friends
The crust is the ish! So good Best deep dish in Chicago.
"Probably a favorite for deep dish. Crust is the best--crusty, thick, and very flavorful. Good idea to get a salad while you wait...even if you call ahead (unless you specify pick-up and pay in advance but let them know you'll eat in the restaurant), it will be 40 minutes. But worth the wait."
"Anyone giving this place less than 4 stars is probably either 1) not a fan of deep dish pizza or 2) irritated by the long wait. Absolutely nothing wrong with the pizza - some of the best deep dish I've had, and I'm a really old fart who's eaten a lot of pizza over the years! Our server was very nice and relatively attentive. The 15 minute wait turned out to be more than 45 minutes - it seems the standard reply at mid-afternoon was ""15 minutes"" and at least one group next to us said they had been waiting more than an hour after being told that. Once seated, we got everything we asked for, refills etc. But the food took a while. So it's definitely not somewhere you're going to go in for a quick bite. Well, maybe a quick bite once you have your food!If you have some time and like deep dish pizza and you're near Chicago, this is a must-visit place."
"I'm generally not a deep-dish fan, but good lord this is one scrumptious pie!  Nice, casual sports bar vibe.  Lots of families and def kid friendly.  Great service, phenomenal pan pizza, and a great value. Have been once with a group of four for dinner, and once solo for the $4.95 lunch special.  The lunch special is a crazy good deal by any standards.  Huge 7"" pan pizza with one topping, includes a beer or soda.  Can I have a beer with lunch?  Hmmm."
"Pequods...I love you. Easily one of the best pizzas I've had anywhere, and I'm a huge pizza snob. If you are an out-of-towner, skip the Gino's East and Unos and come here for the caramelized cheese crust deep dish pizza. You won't regret it. The thin crust here is amazing too. They make a nice, braided crust and is very substantial for a ""thin"" crust. I'm salivating just writing this review!"
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.You want legit Chicago deep dish? Come here.  Take it from me, a hot babe with 30 years of deep dish experience.  Bypass any and all appetizers/salads/pointless fillers. You don't need them.  Pequods did not gain fame from spaghetti or hot wings.  You should save room for their delicious, piping hot, physics defying pizza.  HOW they get the bottom so perfectly crispy and the inside so delectably tender is beyond calculation.  It's perfect.  Here's the real key though: limit yourself on toppings.  You don't need a 5-thing pizza.  Keep it to 3 added ingredients, tops.  Even better?  Keep it simpler.  Chicago pizza is not meant to have 10,000 toppings.  1-2 keeps it simple, keeps it perfect.  I'm very sad I didn't have one of the tasty looking cookies though.  Trying to watch my carbs."
I got a deep dish with sausage and pepperoni.I loved every bite I had. Garlic bread was meh for me but my husband loved it.The chocolate cake and cookies so freaking great can't wait to be back!!!
"Within an hour of my poor review, the manager put a credit on my account, havent checked to see if it is actually there, but giving him credit for the fast response. I still love their pizza no matter what."
"Best Chicago style pizza I ever had, but I'm not a local, so my experience is quite limited.  Staff was friendly and attentive and the pizza was outstanding!  I don't think they do reservations, but you can call ahead and try your luck."
"Great deep dish pizza. On a Saturday night, 1 hour wait to get the pizza (the hostess informed the estimated time, so there was no surprise). Caramelized crust and flavorful toppings. Great service too and good beer selection"
"It was very good. I'm more of a ""stuffed pie"" guy than a ""thick crust"" guy, but better than Malnati's."
Always delicious even though it takes 50 years for a pizza. But how else are they going to get the crust so perfectly crispy?? Love Pedquod's.
"I won't be calling it my favorite pizza... I prefer the stuffed ""more cheese less dough"" pizza, but that being said it was stupid good pizza. So glad we took up the guy from the apple store's recommendation to give it a try.  Be prepared to wait 50 minutes for your pizza, but when it comes out you will know why.  We loved the caramelized crust!"
"You will not taste anything else like the crust. Cripsy, buttery, and thick with carmerlized cheese... it may make you faint. If you go to Chicago, you have to come here. Even if you don't like thick crust pizza, this place will turn you into a believer. No brainer 5 star.Also- if you are staying downtown, it is really easy to take the redline down to this part of town and walk there."
"By far the BEST pizza in Chicago!!!  Thick caramelized crust, choose your toppings.  It does not get any better.  This pizza place was recommended to us by a local so we went there.  It's north of most of the  downtown activities but so worth the extra time it takes to get there.  We went twice during out time there it was sooooo good!!!!"
This place is always packed and there are always people waiting to be seated. It's up to you to decide if that's a good thing or bad thing. I love the pizza here both pan and thin crust. There is a reason they are so busy.
"Many call this the best deep dish in Chicago. I have only had 2 or 3 different ones so I can't say for sure, but Pequod's is absolutely amazing. Beware, we came on a Monday after 1pm and had to wait over 2 hours to get seated and get pizza. We were very hungry so I cannot give this place 5 stars for time of service alone."
Amazing deep dish pizza! Always the freshest veggies (and LOTS of them). The carmelized crust is so unique! ...I actually look forward to eating the crust when we order from here! Pricey but worth it! LOVE
"Wow, I've always heard people say good things about Chicago deep dish pizza, and finally I've experienced it for myself! So just what did I think? Well.... (**channeling Antoine Dodson**), what they say is definitely the truth--Chicago deep dish pizza does indeed rule!  So why did I choose to try Pequod's instead of one of the cliché Chicago pizza joints like Pizzeria Du, Pizzeria Uno, Lou Nalnati's, or Gioradano's on my first visit to the windy city? Well, my boyfriend lived in Chicago for a year and swore up and down that Pequod's was the best. So, being the good partner I am, I took his word for it.  And, he was right-- Pequod's did not fail me... it was awesome! Their deep dish pizza was everything I hoped Chicago pizza would taste like!  Thick, soft-on-the-inside and crunchy-on-the-outside pizza crust.... abundant creamy & bubbly mozzarella cheese... tangy, delicious pizza sauce... and fresh toppings!  Heavenly indeed!As for the atmosphere at Pequod's, it was nice, too! The restaurant is housed in an older building that's been cleverly updated to have a modern industrial look and feel. So, you know immediately that the place is casual, but it's still warm and inviting."
"Food: 4Decor: 3Ambiance: 4Service: 3Value: 4An hour wait for a table. An hour wait for the pie. Why can't they combine those two waits? Otherwise, great food at a good price."
"A friend of mine introduced me to the spot. Good pizza place! I absolutely loveeee deep dish pizza, but I prefer their thin crust over their deep dish."
"This place turned out to be amazing,  I have never been here before but the deep dish pizza was without a doubt one of the best pizzas I tasted in Chicago so far,  the somehow burned crusted made it so special and tasty,  and the serves was very attentive... My new hangout place for pizza"
"I love this place. We have ordered from Pequod's many times, but this time we actually went to the pizzeria. Our reservation was lost (I think our main guy was late and they gave it away), but we eventually were sat upstairs. It took a while for our pitchers of beer to come to the table, but the place was packed so it was understandable. We know the drill with Pequod's that it takes a while to cook the deep dish pizzas, so we placed an order of apps along with the pizza. The combo appetizer plates were delicious and just what we needed to hold us over. Again the server took his sweet time checking on drinks and filling our waters, but we didn't come here for the service. We did, however, decide ordering out was the best way to go when it comes to Pequod's. Pizza was standard delicious and we were on our way! Tip: Get it delivered."
Newcastle on tap in a frozen mug and the best pizza in the area!
"Best deep dish in Chicago I think. Everyone has a preference but the carmelized crust sets this one on top for me. I love a pepperoni, mushroom, basil version and limit myself to 1 every month or so.The crust is so delicious it literally melts in your mouth. Toppings always fresh and did I mention the crust yet?AWESOME!"
"If you're like me, you won't even read this review because it's more fun to read a 1 or 2 star novel length review from someone who broke up with a significant other whilst on a date at (insert establishment name here). Those type of reviews make me feel like I'm an alright and easy going person, you know?This pizza is delicious. Deep dish is not everyone's favorite, but if you like it, try this place. Best I've had in Chicago after 15 years. And if you can't take a complete stranger's recommendation, perhaps Yelp is not your thing.Do your visiting friends and family a favor and bring them to the local's pizza joint."
"This place was an outstanding deep-dish pizza place that scored well all round.It's a neat old place that has character and thankfully plenty of room since it has upstairs and downstairs.  The deep dish pizza was outstanding, hot with a crispy crust, lots of flavour, cheese, sauce, etc., and the crust was rather caramelized on the edge.  Salads and appetizers were good.  Mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini were great, too.  Pasta (ordered for the one kid who does not like pizza) was good.  Beer selection had some great beers on it but unfortunately lacked darker/red/amber beers that I find to be best with pizza.  Service was great."
"Amazing Chicago style pan pizza!! Perfect cheese, perfect sauce, cooked just right. I wanted to keep eating more but I was so full, couldn't even finish the small size. A little far out of the downtown area but worth it to avoid the chains"
"Loved the pizza here! The burnt cheese edges make the pizza. I'm not a huge fan of a ""burnt"" taste, but this is more like caramelized. Loved both the sausage pizza (looked homemade) and the cheese. It does take quite a while for them to make it (one hour for us) but we just called ahead and picked it up. So happy we followed the advice of our friend from Chicago!"
"Unique spin on deep dish. As others have said, it's true the crust is thicker than some other interpretations, but it is fresh, soft and very chewy. I can understand why some feel cheated that they're paying so much for what is essentially focaccia bread, but it has great texture. I think you get plenty of food for the money, so I don't get complaints about price; a large slice (essentially one serving) probably comes in at between three and four dollars and is definitely a meal's worth. Two slices and you'll be stuffed for the rest of the day. Three slices and you'd better be ready to commit to a food coma.On the plus side, they pile the cheese and sauce all the way to the edge and there's barely any sort of crust handle, so that thick bottom is offset by the fact that there isn't much crust at the outside edge of the slice.The trademark ""caramelized"" crust is really more of a char, giving it a nice smoky flavor like something that came off the grille, a pretty distinctive signature that sets them apart and adds a nice finishing touch to the slice.The sauce tends toward sweet as opposed to savory, however their toppings leave just a bit to be desired. I'm a sucker for Italian sausage, but their sausage seems pretty tame to me. Honestly reminded me more of Italian meatballs and despite the fact it has fennel in it, it doesn't seem to have that distinctive punch I'm used to in authentic Italian sausage. I think it needs a little more zip.You can't go wrong here and I would never turn down Pequod's, but the overall flavor profile just seems a bit simple in contrast to some others I've had. That isn't a dealbreaker, but if you're looking for a more complex mingling of flavors in your tomato pie, there are certainly other options around town. If they amped up the flavors in their sauce and toppings just slightly to give it a little more pizzazz, I'd probably give them a solid five stars."
"We just threw a surprise party and this place pulled it off perfectly. Such a great experience and of course, the pizza is incredible."
"Only 5 years in Chicago and I had not heard of this place. Upon arriving early for a movie (across the street), we decided to give it a try. Thought it was just a little pub that had pizza.It's much larger than it appears (multiple levels). While walking to our table, we notice that every single table had deep dish (normally not a fan), so, we chose to fall in line. WOWWWW. Holy cow. Do not miss this pizza. Insanely good."
"Was staying at the dana hotel on a business trip, which happened to be within the delivery zone of this number-one-friend-recommended deep dish pizza place in Chicago. Fortunately, I remembered that deep dish takes MUCH longer than the quick-fires that I'm used to, so I ordered about an hour ahead, which was perfect because, with delivery, it took 1 hr 10 min. WORTH IT!! I ordered the personal size (7"") with meatballs, mushrooms, and pineapple (toppings are charged per, btw), and man was it delicious!! Their cheese and toppings are so yummy, and that caramelized crust is omgtodiefor. I are the whole thing. It's probably enough for two people of my size (5'6"" 125 lbs) to eat, but there was just no way I wasn't going to down every bite of that scrumptiousness. Seriously, I don't care how small you are, get at least a medium if you're sharing or tell whoever you're with to get their own! nom nom nom!!"
"We have been to many pizza places in Chicago. This is by far the best of the best. It's the crispy, cheesy crust that makes this pizza so unique. Every time we visit, we order a large to go, and freeze when we get home. Heats up very well."
Incredible pizza. All that needs to be said. Call ahead and they'll get your order started because deep dish/pan pizza takes a while.
Their pizza is unique and heavenly.  We had good service and nice facility.  They are always busy but with good reason
"By far the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. This IS THE PLACE to go if a local, tourist please ignore this ."
"This pizza is the bomb. I'm not a fan of deep dish, but this pizza is an exception. It. Was. Fantastic. They're famous for their ""caramelized cheese crust"" and for good reason- it was amazing. They have an awesome lunch deal- for $5 you get a fountain drink and a personal sized cheese pizza (you can add extra toppings for an extra charge, but they recommend sticking with cheese only for the best flavor). I got half cheese and half sausage. The sausage was great but I actually enjoyed the cheese half the bestOf note: the pizza takes a solid 30-45 minutes to come out, so don't come here if you're in a hurry"
Second favorite pizza in the city (Lou's is #1) but is very close to the best.  The downfall for me is that there aren't many peaquods and its a haul from the south loop.  Their crust is amazing and I'm a big fan of their sauce.  Prices are extremely reasonable.
"For my money, this is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.The sauce and caramelized crust set it apart from the stiff competition in town. Also, definitely get the sausage!As good as the pizza is, it is a bit bready compared to other options around town. I'm totally fine with that, but if that's not your thing, take note. Also, their salads and appetizers are not at the same level as Lou Malnati's and Giordanos. But I like the pizza better - it just barely beats Lou's in my book - which is why you come here anyways.Pro tip - THE LUNCH SPECIAL."
"I really do not like deep dish Pizza of any kind. I don't want to hear about how Chicago it is to have deep dish. i don't know how that even started but i guess nowadays you have to be into deep dish to be ChicagoanPequods changed my life forever as far as deep dish goes. it is literally the only Deep dish ill eat and every time i have feasted there (over 5 a t least) i have cleared the plate.Not to mention the staff was awesome, crowd was loud and TVs had sports on. so all in all Pequods is the Bomb!!!!Cant wait to go back!"
"this is definitely a chicago staple.  I live not too far from here so I go a bit. It takes about an hour n some change for a pie when its busy (evenings and sunday nights) so plan ahead. Honestly get the much reccomended pan pie, their thin crust is lacking"
"SO GOOD, pricey though thats the only thing keeping me away."
"Hands down best pizza in Chicago.  It's what I recommend to every out of towner.  Forget Lou Malnatis, forget Giordanos, forget Gino's East.  If there is one place to eat pizza here, it's Pequod's."
"I'm in love. I always hated deep dish pizza but now I realize how wrong I was! The combination of their crust, sauce, and overflow of toppings makes this place delicious.The only thing that kinda stinks is the wait. This place is poppin and gets busy right at 11. I got a little anxious waiting for my heavenly personal pizza."
"One of the top places to get Chicago-style pizza in Chicago.  For me the only hard question is whether Pequods is merely ""one of the top,"" or is ""the best.""  The ring of carmelized cheese and the crunch crust are both trademarks and in my view they are both excellent touches.  My only complaint is that the bottom crust is sufficiently thick that there's a slightly higher ratio of bread to toppings on this pie than there is in some of Pequod's competitors.  For some people this last factor is not a complaint at all, and in any event Pequod's is in the very top tier."
"We went on a Friday night and this place was SUPER packed. The doorbell from people leaving and entering was literally going off every minute or so -- that's how popular this place is! The wait wasn't too long though,  we waited for 30 minutes to get a seat. We got a medium deep dish with spinach on the whole pizza, pepperoni on one half and sausage on the other. We've tried our fair share of deep dish pizzas and this one was quite delicious. And the crust is amazing! Price-wise, it's interesting because all their default pizzas are only cheese and you have to pay ~$2 for each topping. So it's cheaper if you only get cheese, but if you end up getting toppings like us, it comes out to about the same as other deep dish pizza places."
"So great going here every time I'm in this city. I always manage to take home 3 personal pies for the flight home. BEST deep dish around, don't be fooled by all the advertisement and billboards throughout the city."
"When a friend of mine mentioned Pequod's as her favorite deep dish in Chicago, my curiosity was definitely piqued.I'm here all night, folks.Eating at Pequod's is a great experience.  The place is just an unassuming bar with a good amount of TVs to just hang out and wait for a delicious pizza to be brought to your table, served right in the pan, no less.Not gonna lie, I miss early 90's Pizza Hut so bad.The service is attentive; two of us at the table were having coffee for lunch (it was a long night) and they kept the pot filled for basically just the two of us.  So onto the pizza.  We got a sausage/mushroom/spinach pizza and a meatball/peppers pizza.  You got big hunky pieces of topping with a yummy sauce and a nice crisp crust to go with it.  Our two pies varied pretty greatly in crust thickness, but either way, both were great.  The biggest negative, however, is that they fall into the trap of soggy veges.  If you have too many veges in your pie, it's just leaving a ton of moisture on there leaving everything a slippery mess and even worse when reheating it.  There are definitely a couple different things they could do to avoid this, like chopping them into smaller pieces, ensuring that they're on the top to let moisture escape, using a salad spinner after chopping, etc.We had some leftovers and because of said sogginess a lot of that cheese just oozed off, which is unfortunate.  Also, the crust got pretty saturated too, so even with a pizza stone, the dough was still pretty soggy.So yeah, for now I would say avoid having too many veges on your pie and avoid taking it home.  It's just not a very good experience.However, despite all of that, I might like this better than the big three..."
"The carmelized crust is as good as they say... but the rest of the pizza is only good.  For my money, I prefer their thin crust.Beware LOOOOOOOOONNNNNGGGG lines to get in"
"For the last three weeks I have been in Chicago working, during that time I have been on an amateur food tour of the city. This place is the only review I have made, it's absolutely incredible. Best deep dish I have ever had, the Carmelized crust is out of this world. Sauce is homemade and wonderful. Can't wait to come back"
"Easily the best deep dish in Chicago. I don't recommend the sausage on their pizza, though."
"It's the CRUST!!!! and all the stuff on top of it. I love this place. I always take out of town visitors here. Pick your toppings, and go for it. The downside is for some reason here I always go for that extra slice that puts me over the edge of fullness. So good!"
"Really great. My first Chicago pizza, and it did not disappoint. Service is a bit slow, but I hear that's typical of the Midwest, and totally understandable for a deep dish. I'd go back again and recommend it to anyone who visits."
"I have just found my new favorite Chicago-style pizza place. The winner goes to Pequod's Pizzeria.This place has the most variety in terms of appetizer selections. I believe appetizers are important for deep dish pizza-serving restaurants largely due to the expectation that these pizzas take longer to make than thin crust ones. In addition, the Pequod's salad is pretty decent (the creamy garlic sauce is clutch). As for the pizza itself, I was astonished. The crust, including the bottom, was crispy and solid. This is difficult to come by. I've always experienced softer/soggier bottom crusts due the way that deep dish pizzas are made in general. In addition, I'm a huge fan of their sausage topping. I definitely think they use a better grade of sausage than other pizza places. The most impressive thing I noticed at Pequod's is the relatively short amount of time it takes to bake the pizzas. I daresay it was the fastest I've seen a Chicago-style deep dish pizza come out. Service is great, the pizza is superior, and prices are relatively cheaper than those at similar restaurants. I haven't taken advantage of this special yet, but if you dine in for lunch (Mon-Fri 11AM-3PM) at Pequod's, you can get a 7"" pan pizza with a soda or beer for $4.95."
"We often go to Pequod's with another couple prior to going to see a movie at the Webster 11 across the street.  This is one of our favorite pies in the city.The Good:The pizza.  Both the deep dish and the thin crust are exemplary.  The other item we really enjoy are the Jalapeno Poppers; they are filled with cheddar cheese instead of the typical cream cheese and it makes for a very delicious appetizer.  I would encourage anyone to try the sampler as well.  This place also has some great beer selections; I'm personally a big fan of the Half Acre Lead Feather.The Bad:Occasionally they will overcook the pizza, usually the pan.  A couple times I've had mine come out with a burnt bottom, which doesn't ruin the meal but is rather disappointing.Also, if you order a Pan Pizza it will take over an hour... not necessarily a bad thing but definitely something to keep in mind.The Ugly:Make sure you call ahead for seating, the host stand is a hot nightmare.  Everything is done old school with pen and paper and everything is very disorganized.  My wife and I once had to eat at the bar because we had been told we had an hour and a half wait after having waited for an hour and a half already (I think the host got his sheets of paper out of order and was seating people who had just showed up while we continued to wait).  I understand it's not easy to deal with a restaurant when it is as small as Pequod's and gets as busy as Pequod's does, but the people at the host stand are often overwhelmed and nowhere near up to the task.That said, this place is a Chicago staple for a reason, and a definite must-eat for anyone trying to sample the city's best pizza."
"I have had many, many deep dish pizzas in my time and then I moved to Chicago from the suburbs and heard about the secret known as Pequods. I had to try it for myself. The virdict... one of the best pies in the City. The toppings are fresh and largely cut, the crust is a blackened delicious Joy. This is a must visit restaurant hands down. You must try this out."
"Best deep dish in Chicago. Hands town. Got introduced to this pizza by my college gf and fell in love and haven't looked back. I like to call it cake pizza though - I can eat for about five days afterward if I order a large. Sooooo worth it though.Also - would argue that the actual place is far better then ordering out though. Great beer, good vibes, great service."
5 star pizza- 3 star service. Really good pizza. Went on pizza tour and fell in love with the pizza. Went back our next trip to Chicago and the pizza was great again but the service wasn't the best. Didn't mind waiting an hour for pizza but the waitress seemed like they could care less if they we were there or not. Constantly had to wait for soft drink refills. Will come back for the pizza but wishing for a five star experience next time.
"A friend asked me for a recommendation for Chicago pizza last week. I would have sent him to Burts Place, but he was just driving through the city. Pequods is the first joint that came to mind. Being back in SoCal, I really miss the Chicago deep dish pizza."
"Holy Deep Dish, this place is amazing! I'm from out of town, and I've had the usual suspects for ""famous"" Chicago style pizza. They were good, but nothing like Pequod's. There is something about the crust; it's light and crispy and flavorful. We just did pepperoni and sausage. We were warned not to overdo it. Between the two of us, we got a small pizza (two pieces each), fried zucchini, and a pitcher of beer, and it was perfect. Totally worth the wait."
"So delicious! Chicago style pizza at its finest. Delicious tomato sauce, super crispy and flavorful crust. Great beer options as well, several local craft brews."
"When coming to Chicago with 4 other friends, one thing was decided. We must stop for deep dish pizza. Off a recommendation from a friends brother, we ended up stopping at Pequod""s.The place has two floors and i like the upstairs a bit more. They have a fair selection of pizzas but since 5 people couldn't agree on any 2 toppings, we decided to go with personal one. I had the mushroom and meatball. I thought it was pretty good, for Chicago pizza. Doesn't compare to the pizza parlor i eat at, at home. Where the guy is from Italy with a heavy accent but i still liked it. Also if they ask you for appetizers because it take 5 minutes to make, you heard them wrong. It takes 35 minutes to make. Our waitress said it right but we just didn't hear it. Get an app if your hungry. While i prefer my normal pizza to deep dish, if you have never had it, Pequod's is an awesome place to go. Also the upstairs bathroom has a big Gandolf face painted on the wall that watches you pee, Kinda freak but worth seeing in itself. From second had information the woman's bathroom has something with arewn."
"This is THE best Chicago style pizza.  The pan pizza is just the best, I think it would win next to any other Chicago style pizza."
"I have been going to Pequod's from about 15 years. I don''t lie in the area, but try to make it out there every now-and-then.They char the edge of the pizza crust topped with cheese making their already delicious pizza so much better. It is truly unique and really tasty. The location is your standard pizza joint, nothing fancy, but last I was there they were quite family-friendly. The staff is also diner-friendly, some friendlier than others."
"My favorite pizza in Chicago.  The pan pizza crust reminds me of Quatro's back in Carbondale.  Pequod's can be pretty busy, so be prepared!"
"Just a couple hours after wolfing down that burger at Aria, I was off on a group pizza tour of Chicago that my company was hosting for our clients. First up was Pequod's. This was my favorite pizza of the night but not my all-time favorite Chicago pizza (see Lou M's). The sauce was a touch on the sweeter side and the cheese was very sparse. yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…There were however two standout qualities of this pizza that stuck in my head; 1) the meats were above par, especially the sausage and 2) the outer crust was phenomenal. It had a nice crisp layer of baked on cheese that was just incomparable. Toward the end of the meal I was just picking at the crust, all while knowing I had a lot more pizza to eat. yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…Overall, not bad at all and I would not mind going back."
"FINALLY made it out here - let me preface this by saying I don't normally like deep dish pizza. I know, I know - I'm a Chicago traitor.  I usually find deep dish to be too clunky and heavy, when I get pizza I want to eat four or five slices at least, and you just can't do that when you're eating deep dish.. unless you have the appetite and stomach capacity of a sumo wrestler.We split a medium deep dish pizza topped with sausage, giardiniera, and onions.  While it does take a bit of time to bake (they need time to make that great crispy crust) - the wait is well worth it.  I've never had such a flavorful and well cooked deep dish crust.  The balance of sauce, toppings, and cheese was also on point.  Will definitely be coming back when I'm having substantial pizza cravings.Check out my full review and pictures at thehungrynoodle.weebly.c…"
Can't beat that crust on the pan pizza! And the sausage is top notch! Try adding garlic for the final kick.
"This is seriously the best deep dish pizza I have ever eaten.  Blows Ginos East out of the water.Great service, great atmosphere."
"Yeah, this is pretty great pizza. Unique to their deep dish is the bit of burnt/carmelized cheese around the edges. It sounds crazy to describe something burnt as good, but it is. The sauce is so rich in flavor, the sausage is homemade to perfection, and the crust is crispy at the bottom while the insides are cooked just right. Because it takes a long time to cook (30-40 min.) give them your pizza order as soon as you can. Their onion rings are out of this world but the Pequod house salad is unremarkable. They are always packed so come early. They don't take reservations but you can get priority seating if you call ahead. I want to withhold a star because it is nuts to go there on the weekend and with tons of people it gets really loud but the pizza is just so good."
"The wait is awful, but all is forgiven when the pizza arrives. Amazing pizza and the crust is super yummy!"
"Best Pizza in Chicago. We recommend eating a late  lunch and then walking to Wrigleyville for some baseball or shopping, the walk shows off the great qualities of Chicago Neighborhoods. Takes just under an hour. Do the Deep Dish with sausage and then go from there!"
Always excellent pizza. We just booked the private party room upstairs for our wedding rehearsal and are so excited! Sean is the best and the space is great. He gets right to the point in the emails when responding to book the private room and no time is wasted. Very flexible. Good draft beer list also included in the package. We can't wait!
"Saw this of the food network and made it one of my must go to places when I visited Chicago. Waited 50 mins for medium deep dish pie which was perfectly fine with me and it was worth the wait. This pie is beautiful and a work of art. Oh yeah, it Tate's good too. Love the cheesy crust. It is also really good while cold for breakfast since this pie a huge even for 2 people."
"Amazing, amazing, amazing. True Chicago-style deep dish pizza. Crust is filling, but not dense. Sauce is light and and very tasty. Stellar pizza."
Best Chicago style pizza! Skip all of the other touristy places and head up to Pequod's. They have the best lunch deal! For less than $5 you can get a personal cheese deep dish and a drink. Don't miss this!You know this a good place when Chicago PD is eating there.
4.5. Loved the sauce and the sausage. Good pepperoni too. A small was enough to be comfortably full. Could have eaten another slice but would have hated myself.
"My husband and I love this place so much!!! Yesterday we went to get our favorite pizza and of course there was a huge line like always but, we were happy to wait! Luckily across the street this wonderful book bar just opened a few months ago called The Kibbitznest and we were able to have a nice drink there while we waited with our clicker. We even got a discount on beer and wine because we had a clicker!! It was fantastic! The bar tenders at the Kibbitznest held onto our clicker while we explored the beautiful place and came to get us when it buzzed to eat our favorite pizza!!! Couldn't have asked for a better night that began at the Kibbitznest and ended at Pequods!"
"Initially I was planning on going to another pizzeria, but everyone in the office (ALL FROM CHICAGO) began telling me about this place... Truly the best pizza I've tried in Chicago.  A solid #2 overall.  I'm sure there's enough people telling you about the details, but if you're going for pizza in Chicago, skip the tourist attractions, go for this place and get the pan pizza."
"Best pizza in Chicago hands down. Crust is perfect, toppings are great and they use real tomatoes instead of some canned sauce for toppings. Absolutely delicious."
"Been here a few times and love the place. This offers something a little different to Lou's. The atmosphere, the drinks and the sports bar feeling. This place can fill up quickly on weekends and get a little noisy but its worth the wait.I'm torn between Lou and Pequod's as to my favorite all time Pizza. However, I do love the rustic pans, caramelized base and crust. Service is with a smile. This place is dang cheap and services great food"
"I eat A LOT of pizza.  In my world, there is no such thing as bad pizza.  Hands down, this is the best pizza I have ever put into my body.  And there has been a lot of pizza in this body.I had it 11 hours ago, and I'm considering a trip up there for lunch."
"Food: Love, love, love this place! This is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago and I don't care if I have to wait for it. Love the crunchy cheesy crust and the sauce is amazing! Try the meatball, pepperoni and green pepper combo. Yummmmm! Oh but I tried the salad once and it was just okay but hey, you come here for the pizza right?Service: Always on point! The waitresses are cheerful and fast. That's saying a lot considering how busy and how tightly packed it is on the first floor.My husband and I have decided that Pequod's will be our last meal should we ever move away from Chicago."
"Awesome spot with great food and beer, as the wait times for a table during peak hours can attest. I've had both the thin crust and the deep dish pizza and both are amazing - although I'm a bigger fan of the deep dish pizza. The crust is perfectly crispy, thick, and buttery. Pequod's definitely doesn't skimp on toppings, either, so each bite of pizza is the perfect combination of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings. Definitely one of my favorite pizza joints here in Chicago. If you come without a reservation, don't let the long wait time turn you away - the pizza is definitely worth the wait!"
I visited the Morton grove location which is the original and it is no comparison to the Clybourn location. It was still good but it was no match for Clybourn. The Clybourn location has more and bigger toppings and even the cheese is cheesier. This will always be my favorite pizza place.
My family and I stumbled upon this great pizza place by accident. My dad and I signed up for a 5 mile race down town and had to pick up our packet at Running Away Multisport that is a few doors down. Being from the suburbs we were unfamiliar with the area and decided to walk down the street to find something to eat for dinner. As we walked past Pequod's the smell of their great pizza literally stopped us in our tracks. The Pizza smelled so good we did not look any farther and went in.When we walked in the place was very busy and we were greeted by the hostess who informed us that we would have a fairly long wait ahead of us. It was a Friday night so we expected a wait. She said if we would like we could wait at the bar area. The bartender took our orders and told us that if we like we could look at a menu and place our order ahead of time or wait till we go to our table. We opted to wait till we got to our table and they had no problem with that. For being as busy as they seemed I expect to be rushed but this was not the case. Restaurants make money through a high turn over but our waitress didn't mind letting us take our time to enjoy the experience.Since this first experience we have braved the weather and Chicago traffic from the suburbs several times to go back for their awesome pizza. If you are in the area and looking for some deep dish pizza with crust you probably haven't had before (caramelized) give Pequod's a try.
"I was new in town this past weekend trying to compare NY style to Chicago style. Went to 4 different places, the names everyone mention, and was not impressed. A cashier from the Laguanitas Brewery on W 17th St really recommended this place. The last night I was in town I had to give deep dish another try before knocking it and I have to say this is the absolute best deep dish I could find."
"Great deep dish pizza for a steal. Service was good, pizza (pepperoni) was tasty, and there wasn't much of a wait (granted we did get there kind of early for a Friday night). Their pizza is a bit more doughy than cheesy, so although we did feel like fat kids afterwards we weren't in a food coma as can sometimes happen. Definitely would come back."
"In my humble opinion, best pizza in town. Not going to get into the debate on deep dish vs. pan vs. whatever-the-fuck but have a couple slices of this and tell me that crust isn't the standard bearer for deliciousness. Fun, noisy atmosphere. Great for a bite before the movie or with a group for a birthday. Grab a cocktail at Drinking Bird while you wait!"
"I am not a huge fan of deep dish BUT I am a huge fan of Pequod's deep dish!!! That has to mean something right?! Don't get sucked into the hype with Lou Malnati's because Pequod's is significantly tastier, and it's so much more well made! I never thought I'd see the day when I would be craving deep dish. :) Thank you so much Pequod's!!"
"The carmelized deep dish pizza here is second to none in the Second City! Great for take out if you live nearby and keep the pizza hot and ready for eating! So many different toppings to create mouth-watering pizzas. I particularly like having pineapple with bacon on mine.The location in Morton Grove is great and very handy for north suburban residents off of I-94. It is located in a charming little woodsy building that is intimate and fun. If you haven't tasted Pequod's, check it out. It is a top-notch Chicago deep-dish pizza experience."
"They have thin and thick crust and a range of apps, so there's something for everyone (who's not a vegan or health nut, I'd say). The thick crust was good, probably as good as any I've had. It took a good while to come. The restaurant feels like a local place. It's a bit dark inside. The staff is friendly, although not super attentive."
"Oh, Pequod's. I travel to Chicago quite a bit, and each time I need to either make a stop here or have them deliver, that's how obsessed I am (and I've had them all-- Giordano's, Malnati's, Uno's, Pizanos)!In a nutshell, it's the best deep dish you'll find in the city-- the blackened crust is amazing, and the fillings are always incredible. The pizza is always on point, but their delivery service is something that lives much to be desired; the couple of times I ordered it delivered, they delivered it without pre-slicing it, and even though I requested paper plates and napkins and they said they would bring them, the driver never brought them with our order (something that made eating the pizza a bit of a challenge).Also, be wary of asking them to deliver to hotel rooms-- the last driver we had called repeatedly to complain about having to deliver to the room and asked us to meet him down the street. An hour of phone tag later and we finally got our pizza. Dude, next time just park in front of the hotel!!Five stars for the food, two and a half for delivery."
"Pequod's is consistently delicious!  When I moved to my condo, it took at least a year and a meeting in the elevator with the delivery driver to learn that Pequod's delivers to my building!  What a pleasant surprise! Delivery is speedy and hot!  The restaurant is a very nice little spot with an upstairs and comfortable seating.  Staff is always pleasant, even during high capacity times and it's always a pleasant experience."
"After hearing a lot about this place from friends, my wife and I decided to finally give it a try. And what do you know: it's now one of our favorite pizza spots. Located in a good area with lots of shopping and even a movie theater across the street, this place starts off great. You walk in, there is always a line up so you put your name down and stand with the crowd with a pager in your hand. In the mean time, you can order your pizza so that when it's time for you to be seated, the pizza won't be too long. Since this is a sports bar as well, it is very crowded but lively. Don't let the place fool you because there is another floor upstairs with lots of seating room. We sat upstairs both times that we visited. The appetizers are also fresh and tasty. But let's talk about the thick crust pizza: it's NOT like pizza UNO, like Giordano's, or any other deep dish pizza you might think of. This is in a class of its own. The deep dish pizza is covered with the toppings you want which is one thing I like to see...more toppings than cheese. As you bite into, or cut into the pizza, you notice that even though it is thick crust, it's not too soft or too hard or full of dough. Somehow, the thick crust isn't as dough-like as you would think and therefore, not as filling as you would think. It's perfect! The outer crust area on top has their special touch to it: it is burnt cheese all around the top which gives it more of a different flavor when added to the pizza takes the whole experience to another level. Overall: one of our favorite pizzas in Chicago. For a regular pizza outing, I would choose Pequod's over any other ""deep-dish"" Chicago pizza."
"My review might be colored by the fact that the pizza at Pequod's was the very first deep dish I'd had, but I absolutely loved it!I was in Chicago for the holidays, to visit friends, and someone suggested Pequod's for proximity reasons. Although I did get to have deep dish pizza again during my stay, and from a different place, there's no way I can compare that and Pequod's.How do you describe deep dish pizza? Let me just say that I understand why it's called a ""pie"" now. In fact, that's how I can best describe it - a very tomatoey, very cheesy, very meaty pie, with a hot, crisp crust!We went for a medium sausage pizza to be shared by 4, and underestimated how large and heavy it will be. It took 45-50 minutes to prepare, but two slices, and I was done!Don't get there when you're extremely hungry, because in all likelihood, there's gonna be a line when you get there, and then the wait for the pizza. But MAN the pizza is amazing!"
"I always just get mine to go, so I can't say anything of the service here. However, the pizza is always fantastic! It's also great that they're open so late. Definitely a must try for anyone looking for something new!"
"Best pizza place in the city, they don't do standard chicago deep dish. I think that's a good thing because nothing kills the night faster than a stomach full of cheese and sausage. The caramelized crust is something unique, the toppings are plentiful and service prompt."
One of my fav Chicago deep dish pizza places. Sometimes hard to get a seat as there are long lines but worth it!
Had to check out this historic spot. Great atmosphere. Long wait on a Friday at 1 for a table.  We opted for the bar and had no wait. It's first come first serve.  Pizza was great picture is of a small pizza for two. Staff was nice.
"Standard LP faire with great pizza and a bar vibe.  The pizza is what you go for, not the ambiance (which is like a college bar), not the location (on a boring intersection on Clybourn).I love their lunch specials and the place is not crowded at that time either.  Try it and you will love it."
This is the best deep dish pizza I have had. If you got a taste for pizza try this place it will be worth it.
"This is MY FAVORITE pizza in Chicago when it comes to deep dish. There is nothing like it and it's worth the wait if you come during dinner. All of my experiences with staff have been extremely pleasant and the pizza, drinks and appetizers are always what I expect-DELICIOUS! I want Pequods now! Soooooo gooooood! Keep up the excellent work!!"
The pizza is bomb. Theres something about sausages on chicago pizzas... its way better than the sausages on pizza in california. They have alcoholic root beer here. I was a happy camper.
"My beloved Pequod's, how I miss thee. I still fantasize about your delicious, cheesy, caramelized crust and your crispy, spicy pepperonis. Oh, and your amazing, flavorful sauce. When my husband asks me what I want for dinner, I still answer Pequod's, even though that is a long lost dream.  I miss being able to order your deliciousness until the wee hours of the night when the craving would hit.  I miss the excitement I would feel when the buzzer in my apartment would go off and how my husband and I would get the Pequod's shrieks when we knew you were coming up the steps.  I miss how I would open the box and say every single time, ""Ohhhhhh, this is a good one!  Check out that caramelization!""  I miss drafting pizza slices based on the amount of crust carmelization with my husband.  Pequod's, you have ruined all pizza for me.  I can't eat other pizza without thinking of you.  Nothing will ever come close to comparing with your greatness and nothing will ever replace you in my heart.   I can only hope that we will meet again soon.   Fondly yours,Kristy"
"Sauce is just a tad too sweet for me personally, but this is still really good pie.It does get busy so if you plan to dine in, get here early!"
"HOLY HELL!I think I have died and gone to Pizza heaven.For serious.It seems my fellow yelpers are again correct in saying this is the BEST pizza in Chicago! WOW! Here's the breakdown:P = Popular beyond belief...and now I know why! It's the perfect place to grab a bit & a brew while watching Sunday night football :) Thankfully, they have 3 whole stories to accommodate all of their fans! E= Exceptional beers! Tapping into my inner local [pun intended!] we sampled various IPA's, Pale Ale's and various cocktails on the menu! They have everything :)Q = Quantity is massive! Being newbies, our party ordered apps, and 2 pizza's leaving us with hands full of to-go boxes and full bellies the next day! perfect!U = Undoubtedly the best crust ever!! Not only do they douse your pizza in cheese, but they add some extra on the crust for a nice crunch! mmmm!O = Orgasm to the mouth. Not even kidding.D = Drains the wallet a bit, but 100% worth it! :)'S = a STAPLE of Chicago!!"
"Bartender was cool, and for my first deep-dish experience, pizza was awesome.  The sauce was a little on the tangy side, which I wasn't a HUGE fan of, but everything else was great.  I got the small sausage & pepperoni and had half a pizza left to give to a homeless guy on my way to the train.  I would've kept it for later, but I felt guilty not sharing.Will return when I'm back in Chicago, but admittedly have not tried Malnati's, Giordano's or others yet."
I LOVE PEQUODS! This is my favorite pizza place and I always have had an amazing time there. great food and my family will forever order from this place. This is great Chicago pizza and I think that this is some of the coolest food we have in the city.
"5 stars without hesitation. My chicagonian friends recommend this as THE best in town, so we stopped in to cap off the weekend. It's definitely the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Ill also add that I'm not easy to please. You should just come. That is all."
"""Call me Ishmael"" - First line of Moby Dick The restaurant is named after Captain Ahabs ship in the novel. The place is huge and it was packed when we went. There was a sign that pizzas were running 50 minutes. That is a long time. You might as well read Moby Dick while you wait for your pizza. Good thing I didn't have to be anywhere and I was with great companyWhen the pizza finally came out it looked and smelled delicous. It was definitey worth the wait. I was stuffed after 1 1/2 pieces. It was very heavy. I am a New Yorker and I know pizza. Deep dish isn't my favorite but Pequod's is the place to get deep dish in Chicago. I suggest ordering an appetizer while you wait. ""Then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago."" - Last line of Moby Dick."
"My party of 8 dined here for lunch on a Saturday . We used the website to request seating a few days in advance . We were seated right away. The food was amazing. We ordered the appetizer combo, everything tasted fresh. We also had a sausage and cheese thin crust pizza, it was really good. A few people in my party thought the sausage tasted weird or like it came from a box. I do not eat sausage so I wouldn't know. I would come back"
"I have eaten at about 5 Chicago pizza places now and I must say that this is the best pizza in the city. Came here mainly because I have heard so much about it and I just had to give it a try. When you first walk in, it looks like a bar and grill with an upstairs, not to mention the small size menu. For starters, I went the buffalo wings, which were really really good. As for the pizza, I went with a sausage, pepperoni, and garlic. The pizza is simply greatness. The sausage is on point, they give you a lot of pepperoni and the garlic blends in greatly. The slices are big (got a medium with six slices for two but should of just got a small) and the addition of the legendary caramelized crust takes the pizza into a unseen stratosphere. Their beer (at $6 a glass) is even at a decent price. Overall the only pizza place I haven't ate at in Chicago is Lou malnati, but if it's anything like Pequod then lord help us all."
"Yumme yumme yummee!!! One of my favorite places when I visited Chicago. Ordered the large deep dish pizza and 3 orders of wings. Both were delicious! I am a pizza lover, this place didnt dissappoint."
"Pizza preferences are usually based on where you're from, so let me start this by saying that I'm from Cincinnati. I like thick-ish pan pizzas with slightly tangy sauce and a chewy, stringy mozzerella topping. I like to eat pizza with my hands, and I like to eat more than one slice (lookin' at you, deep dish). Overall I like a balance of the sauce and cheese that, in my opinion, neither NY style nor Chicago style have a lock on (NY: too much cheese, Chicago: too much sauce). So Pequod's: great or the greatest?? Lemmie break it down for you: Sauce: Killer-diller. Not too sweet and not too tart.Cheese: Mozzerella--chewy and delicious. Weirded out initially by the cheese on the crust, but it gives the pizza a nice crunch at the end. Crust: Oh god so good--this is the mother-of-all pan pizza crusts. Thick, but solid and not incredibly doughy like Chicago deep dish. Crunchy and crusty at the bottom so that you can actually eat a slice with your hands without it bending down. Sauce-to-cheese ratio: Almost perfect! A little heavy on the sauce, but way closer to my ideal ratio than any other pizza joint in the area. Toppings: This is the only thing that threw me. The garlic topped pizza was fantastic, but the sausage on the sausage-topped pizza was too chewy for me--almost seemed over-cooked. Verdict: Sausage-less Pequod's is my true-heart's desire. I can't speak for the in-restaurant service, since I got it delivered. Pequod's pizza all day, every day, now and forever, amen."
Pequod's is where you go to get your comfort food- deep dish pizza. My fiance loves Pequod's and I've learned to love it as wel. :)
"Personally, my favorite pizza in Chicago! Living in the city, we've had our fair share, but nothing compares to this! And SO IMPRESSED that they deliver all the way downtown to us! Thanks, Pequod's! Best pizza in Chicago delivered right to our door!! YUMMMMM... (also, the ONLY pizza I'll cheat on my diet for) :)"
"Best. Pizza. In. Chicago. If you have never been here before, be prepared for the burnt cheese crust. You won't be disappointed. Also check out the weekday lunch special. $5.99 one topping personal pan pizza and a soft drink. Great neighborhood gem."
"I have never dined at the restaurant, only ordered delivery.  It will be a minimum 90 minute wait to get your delivery so order early.  The individual pan pizzas are great, I am a big fan of the spinach as it is fresh and not frozen.  The Pequods salad is awesome although the big chunks of raw yellow onion are overpowering."
"Always a great meal here! My boyfriend and I don't eat dairy and they always make our cheeseless pizza and it never fails to disappoint! We also had the wings here and they are very good too! Just go here, it's always good and the service is good too."
Great pizza dine in or carry out....Always consistent. Love the deep dish....
"I suppose I should first share my thoughts on the other well known Chicago deep dish pizzas: Lou Malnati's - Super buttery, super greasy, and super cheesy. Immediate food coma following the meal. If you love all of the above then you'll love Lou's.Giordano's - Heavy on the sauce and cheese and the crust felt wet. So basically it's a pile of yummy mush in your mouth. That's not necessarily bad, but also not amazing. Pequod's is the perfect deep dish pizza. The ingredients are fresh. As in, the italian sausage is the best I've ever had and even the bell peppers still have a slight crunch. The crust isn't drenched in butter or grease and it has a light crunch. There's even a rim of burnt cheese around the top. (Don't make a face. Everyone loves burnt cheese.) Every person I have introduced to Pequod's has fallen in love. If you haven't already, go tonight. Also, the pizza is made to order so you should expect to wait 30 minutes for the pizza after you've placed your order. Staff has always been awesome and the atmosphere feels like you're hanging out with your best friends at a divey sports bar."
"Pequod's was my first Chicago deep dish pizza experience and it was awesome!  After waiting for the 40-minute cooking time, our pie finally arrived and not a moment too soon because I was starving after a long day of sight-seeing.  Our pizza came loaded with big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, and copious amounts of stringy, molten mozzarella.  The thick crust had a beautifully caramelized, chewy ring of cheese surrounding the edge.  It was hands down the tastiest-looking pizza I have ever laid my eyes on.  With a whirl of knife and fork, I inhaled two delicious slices before hitting the food wall.  Deep dish pizza is deceivingly filling so if it's your first time having it, don't be surprised if you are full after two pieces.       I've since tried Jordano's deep dish and while very very good, I'd still say Pequod's is number one for me.  Lou M's is next on my list to try!"
"The pan is great. One of the most unique in Chicago, which is something to pull off. The thin, not so great imo. But the vibe is awesome. The people make you feel at home. And other than going to Burt's in Morton Grove, this is as good as this style of pan Za gets."
"After much researching into who had the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, Pequod's made the final 4 (Art of Pizza, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East were the others), which I tried while I was in Chicago, this past Fall. After having all 4, Pequod's ended up at the top of my list. Being a Pittsburgher, I think it's a travesty that they don't ship nationwide, like Malnati's and Gino's. That said, I have asked and they said they will par bake pies for shipment, but somebody would have to pick them up and ship them themselves. Might any of you local Chicagoites be willing to help out a fellow Pequod's-lover? If so, you can reach me at bassbone26@hotmail.com. Thanks!"
"Best deep dish in the city!  Can be a long wait, though, even during the week."
"My first pizza i had from them was nothing special.  I decided to give them another shot and try something a little more diverse.  The crust, sauce, and cheese really cant hold it's own by itself.  GET SOME TOPPINGS AND THIS PIZZA COMES ALIVE!!!!!"
only place to get deep dish and not your dads rootbeer and die happy.
i am a pizza enthusiast. the best in chicago! will be back.
"The year is 1994...or was it 93? Anywho, been digging this spot since the neighborhood boys washed dishes and me and the girls waited out back till they finished there shift,  toting a freshly made pie! My neighbor was one of those guys, so I got the dibs! Fast forward and I can't get a seat without a reservation. Who would have thunk it. Thanks for the memories and great Pizza! The good old days...."
"Being from the Suburbs of Chicago, and growing up next to a Lou Malnati's, I have never had anything close to compare to Lou's. Don't get me wrong Lou's is still #1 in my book... But if you're looking for some deep dish, this place is top notch. Pizza is a staple around these parts, and everyone has their deep dish pizzas, but nothing touches Pequod's style. Their caramelized crust is delicious, you cant just have one slice of it, likely half a pie in a sitting if you're being true to yourself. If you have a chance to get over there, do not pass it up. The parking for this place can be a little tricky, there is paid parking across the street, and if you're reaaaaaaally lucky you might be able to find local free parking, or maybe a meter'ed spot. Also the place is very small, so be prepared to wait for seating if you go during peak hours. Open late, and they deliver!"
"This is the best Pizza in Chicago. lou malnati's and uno's pizza has nothing on this pizza. I like thin crust pizza, not into eating a bunch of dough with my pizza with deep dish. But I did try a few bites of the deep and it is by far the best. The thin is even better. This place is always packed and forget getting a table if you get here late. The best time to come is between 4-6p. Make it another night if you get there any later."
"My now husband and I knew we were meant to be when we determined our favorite Chicago pizza was undoubtedly Pequod's. When faced with the decision of where to have our rehearsal dinner last February, the solution was a no-brainer. The evening of the rehearsal dinner went perfectly. Their upstairs private party room is a little tight, but it was cozy, intimate and casual - just what we were looking for. The service was awesome. As a type-A bride-to-be, I have to say the only negative was their lack of traditional planning/coordination. We ""booked"" our event about 9 months out with an email from Pequod's saying, ""You got it, the date is yours."" We didn't sign a contract or put any money down, which felt different from the other vendors we booked. Regardless, after I allowed myself to trust in their process, we followed up with them a few times leading up to the event and they were warm, kind, and accommodating when we wanted to come tour the space. Would recommending hosting an intimate event here! And this goes without saying at this point - there pizza trumps all."
My second favorite after lous. Unlike most pequads is more crust less cheese. The sauce is great the burnt crust is amazing! Don't underestimate the beef sandwich it was so good!! Prices should be higher I would pay more Service was bar service not bad not great! But the food is worth going for
"I can only speak on Pequod's delivery as I have never actually been to the restaurant.Co-workers and I had a hankering for good Chicago style pizza, so we decided on Pequod's. I called right when they opened at 11am, and ordered two large pan pizzas for the 8 of us. The lady on the phone was less than polite, but it sounded like it was busy in there. Our office was out of the delivery zone but only by a few blocks, so they charged us a buck more and accommodated the order. She said it would be there in about an hour. I ended up getting a call from the delivery guy an hour an a half later. Bye bye, 5 star rating. The pizza was delicious. It had had enough time to cool off a bit and was the perfect temperature. Toppings were plentiful and that cheesy caramelized crust really sets it apart from its competitors. Will definitely order again."
"Pequod's Pizzeria has both thin crust and pan pizza offerings. I had to go pan because that's the way you get the caramelized crust which is Pequod's claim to fame. I'll admit I'm a bit particularly when it comes to pizza and really feel like the essential elements (crust, sauce, and cheese) have to come together to hit pizza perfection. The crust: true to style, chewy and bready on the interior but crispy and crunchy where it hits the pan with the carmelization from the cheese. The sauce: savory and really good, I actually got extra sauce on my pizza which is a great call for the pan style. The cheese: way too much for me, really the thing that makes this pizza the hardest to eat. If you want pan pizza in Chicago this is the place to come though. So far one of my favorite pie's in the city."
"YOU MUST GET THE SAUSAGE!!!! It's the best pizza sausage you can have. The ingredients are wonderful. The pizza has the perfect blend of cheese, sauce and crust.If there is one minute flaw to Pequod's it's that you have to take it easy on the toppings, because they really pile them up and it can overtake the pizza. Stick with 1-2 toppings and you'll be happy.Access to this place is not easy. It's a good 10-15 minute walk from the Fullerton Red Line. Parking is not fun. Unless you live in Lincoln Park, it's difficult. It's TOTALLY worth it though to try. Fantastic pizza!"
"I walked into this restaurant and knew right away this was my kind of place. It has a neighborhood ""everybody knows your name"" vibe. Our waitress was full of personality and very nice. She definitely added to the experience. Additionally, she provided us some sightseeing spots for the area to maximize our trip from downtown (Wicker Park). I had their wings which were tender with the perfect amount of heat. I highly recommend starting your meal off with a plate of them. Next, came the pizza. The deep dish was absolutely yummy. The sauce was smooth versus chunky and plentiful versus missing. The cheese and pepperoni were good completing the pie. Finally, this spot offers a lunch special of cheese personal size pizza with a drink, M-F, for only $4.95. You can't beat that deal!"
"Yum yum yum. If you love a pan pizza with a crispy crust, this is the place for you! When it comes out, you see it's a darken crust and you know that you're going to get that perfect crunch when you take a bite. The crust is so flakey and exactly what I look for in a pan pizza. We order a medium sausage, onion and garlic pizza. The sausage is more like balls, like a meatball versus smaller pieces. I wasn't quite the fan of that, despite it being good. And I could only smell the garlic versus tasting it on the pizza. I think next time I'll switch it up and try other toppings. But it's definitely delicious!!!"
"I never really liked deep dish pizza because the crust is waaaaayyy too thick and not much filling. Zachary's in the bay area made me like deep dish pizza, I figured I just had really bad ones (BJ's and the like). I was in Chicago not too long ago and we had to come here because it's voted one of the best deep dishes in town. And I concur, it was AMMMMAAAZIIINNNGGGG. I don't even know how to describe that taste, it definitely hit the umami level. You just have to try it for yourself, it's really hard to explain. They use very fresh ingredients and are not cheap with it. The sausage pieces are GINORM!!! The bread is actually thin and crispy, it's alllll filling!!! yey!If i could add another star, I would, for the whale that wears a thong over its head."
"I've eaten here about half a dozen times. It definitely gets crowded, so I suggest ordering to go. It's a place that shows what Chicago pizza can be."
Ordered delivery on a Sunday night at 7:30.  Told delivery would take about an hour and a half but it came in about an hour. Yeah!First time ordering- and it sure is yummy!! Got  a thin crust and a deep dish and both were fabulous.
"This is by far...The. Best. Pizza. In. Chicago.  I was going to say, ""in the world"", but I don't want to over-sell.  Granted, I only lived in Chicago for 4 precious, wonderful, joyful years, but I had the opportunity to eat a lot of pizza, including the more ""trendy"" ones.  You know which ones I'm talking about.  This pizzeria blows all the rest away.  The caramelized crust...Oh-Mylanta!  The only downside is that it's SORT OF off the beaten path.  So the nearest El stop is 0.8 miles away.  No bus that I know of goes near their either.  My recommendation: get off the red/brown line stop at Fullerton and just enjoy a nice walk there and back...it'll help burn off the calories you are sure to accumulate from stuffing your face full of delicious pizza!  Just trust me.  GO NOW!Oh, I forgot to mention the whole ""Is this really deep-dish pizza?"" question.  Now, I am a fan of deep-dish pizza, BUT it can get a little overwhelming.  Pequod's airs on the side of a ""conservative deep-dish"", so you aren't going to get a pizza that is quite as pie-like as the other guys.  I appreciate this.  You may not.  But I just wanted to throw that out there so there are no surprises!"
"My favorite deep dish/pan pizza in the city, and it's not even a close call. First you must recognize the difference between pan pizza and deep dish/stuffed pizza. If you're looking for a cheese overdose and are expecting that mozza string that only breaks when you're holding the paddle a foot over your head, that is not this pizza, that is stuffed pizza. I prefer the ""light"" and fluffy crust of pan pizza to the thickly packed, flattened down cornmeal covered deep dish crust. Admittedly no there is not a ton of cheese on here, but I don't think that's too bad of a thing, especially when they offer extra cheese. I remember having Lou Malnati's for the first time and feeling disappointed. I don't like the patty layer of sausage, and with a lot of stuffed pizza places the toppings are under the cheese, which I really don't care for. The toppings should be crispy on top with a little char, not soggy floating around in cheese. Peqoud's took every tweak I would make in other pan pizza formulas and applied the changes I would make to create the perfect pie. LOL @ the review that said the cheesy garlic bread looked like they just added butter, garlic, and cheese to the bread wtf did you think cheesy garlic bread would have on it, foie gras? The caramelized cheese crust, I don't even need to tell you about, you've already heard it. Service is spot on, not in your face every minute, but your glass is never empty. The place is deceivingly larger than you think because they have an upstairs, so don't be discouraged if it looks full when you walk in! Anyway the pizza is also gorgeous, I remember finishing a huge slice and being full, and the table next to us was just getting their pie delivered to their table and I was like ""Ooo I want that. Wait. I have that. I just ate that. Omg I want theirs too though."" Anyway I'm in love with Peqoud's and if you have a single taste bud and/or brain cell you will too."
"I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of this place. And the service was quick and good as well. We got small jalapeño, mushroom, sausage and pepperoni pan pizza. It was awesome. One of the best deep dish pizzas. Sauce was perfect. And so was the ratio of toppings, cheese, and sauce. The cheese baked on the crust was so good. Can't wait to come back to Chicago to eat there again."
"There's Pizza and then there's PEQUOD'S PIZZA. It's off the chart and as original as it gets!When you get a craving for it, no other slice will do..Morton Grove location is an old house, pretty cool place."
"Caramelized crust won me over.   sauce is very good and not too much. for any deep dish pizza noob, please note that deep dish does take longer to make (40-45 mins) so please be prepared for that.another useful tip for deep dish, if you order it to go or delivery, as them NOT to cut it for you.the crust will stay cripsy longer if you dont cut it and cut it yourself at home.during the wait we would just drink and have an app or two.  that should suffice .as for time to go, place gets packed during the weekends so if you go on a weekend.  8-830pm would be ideal.  for weekdays it's should be fine during normal dinner/supper times."
"Yes this is really 'as good as it gets' for deep dish pizza in Chicago. I've tried Giardinos, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's, and this DePaul suburban establishment definitely takes the crown as BEST. This place is a no brainer and all you need are a set of taste buds to realize this is great pizza. The ingredients are phenomenally fresh and toppings are generous. Flavorful homemade marinara sauce and a buttery soft crust, make this a very well rounded pizza.Pequods is definitely the place to be and is worth the quick trip on the loop to Lincoln Park. Can't wait to visit again soon!"
"The herbaceousness of the sausage is a step shy of critical mass: so righteous a ratio of spices-to-meat that vegetarians get confused and carnivores...well, carnivores just feel hungry for more.But the true crown of the Pequod's 'za is the crust. It caramelizes. Put the word ""caramelizes"" in italics in your mind in the prior sentence. Give it urgency. Who else does that? Seriously, tell me in the comments, because I want more o' that...but I still defy any house in town to match the mystical Pequod's sausage. I don't care if it sounds gay. In fact put that in italics...just to make it fabulous. The original kitchen, In '06, burned down. The cooks, in their envelope-pushing ways, set in motion the inferno after heating the oven until it became its own sentient life form. The oven, only pretending to shut off when the kitchen staff closed, burst into flame like a teen whose parents' vacation flight just went wheels up, only the damage was harder to cover up with a Swiffer. Now, that's just rumor, but we're Americans, and we need our history to feel connected. Coming soon: an app to track the oven temperatures at Pequod's, but instead of a red ""warning"" indicator, there's a cute graphic of ingredients for s'mores. Open up your uber when it reaches ""graham cracker smoosh"" (looks as cute it sounds). Parking, like the sausage, will get out of hand."
"I had this place written down as a restaurant to try, based on a food show I watched years ago.  My husband and I were running errands and got hungry.  We decided to stop in for lunch since we were only a few blocks away (thank you trusty list of restaurants to try).   The place has an Interesting vibe and great pricing for lunch.  I can say the rave review from that food show was totally appropriate.  Perfect pizza!  And we have driven there for a pizza since having lunch silently wishing there was a downtown location."
Best pizza I have had in Chicago. Apparently fly more people from out of town come out to check this place out. Go with with basil and giardinera deep dish pizz.
"I am not a lover of deep dish pizza. But this is off the chart delicious!   The place is crowded all the time, but well worth the wait. The best deep dish pizza in the world!"
"Ask your Chicago friends where to eat and they give you the best!Under the recommendation from my brother from another mother, he told us that this place is one of the best pizza places! He was right! It is walking distance to DePaul University (he went there) and about 3 miles from our hotel. We decided to cab it to this pizzeria and walk back to burn off those calories! The restaurant/bar looks small on the outside, but when you get in, it is actually bigger. It is two stories and there is plenty of seating upstairs. We arrived pretty early (round 12) to beat the crowds and there was no wait for us to be seated. This is the ""official"" Blackhawks bar. My friend says ""EVERY bar"" is the official Blackhawks bar. Anyway, we got the lunch special (individual pizza and soda) for about $6.00. It was a good deal! Apparently, they used to serve the special with beer, but that stopped due to the new laws. Anyway, we shared a salad which tasted very fresh and helped ease my hunger pains while waiting for the deep dish. Deep dish pizza takes awhile, but it is worth the wait!I got pepperoni and spinach for my deep dish and I am a fan of deep dish. Wow. The sauce is sweet but tangy and the cheese....so much goodness! The small individual pizza looks small, but is fairly big and difficult to finish. The crust is crunchy and a bit thicker than I hoped for, but still very tasty! I did not finish my deep dish because it was just so much (Shame, shame!), but was glad to have it while on the walk back. The staff is friendly and really nice. Our waitress gave good recommendations and told of us other tourist attractions. She was very knowledgeable! The atmosphere is very chill and seems to be frequented by the college audience, since DePaul University is within walking distance."
"I do not like pan pizza in general. Too much bread. HOWEVER, I LOVE Pequod's pan pizza. The carmelization, the generous toppings, the sauce. This is, to me, the very definition of Chicago pizza. This is a must-go for anyone visiting and looking for good pizza. I just wish I lived closer, but I'll always make the special trip."
the.best.pizza.ever. It gets super packed but is well worth the wait. Bring anyone here to show them *true* chicago style pizza!
"I stopped by here for the first time a couple days ago after a workout. I had heard a ton of amazing things, but I was especially drawn in by the lunch special. For $4.95 you can get a personal pan pizza with one topping and a fountain soda (no refills)!! If you check in on Yelp, you can get the same deal but with a beer. The pizza took a while to prepare, but hopefully that means the lunch portions are made to order (some places have frozen lunch pizzas). The pizza was delicious and the service was excellent. I'll definitely be back!"
"Best deep dish in the city!  Keep in mind we live on the west side,  within 15 min of 3 Lou's and a Giordano's, and we'd still prefer to trek up here for delicious pizza!"
Pequod's is truly one of the best pizza's ever. The butter crust with the carmelized cheese to the edge is amazing. Every place else wishes they were Pequod's. Only downside is the location is small. But they make up for it with great pizza.
"After having two deep dishes with cornmeal crust, I was ready for straight up crust and this place came recommended.  After walking 10 miles around the city that day, I wasn't up for the trek so we were glad to see we fell within their delivery window.  It was a 90 minute wait but worth it.  That burnt looking stuff you see around the edge of your pizza is what they call caramelization...they are correct.  Not a hint of burnt on the area.  I will say though if you're on a first date, bring toothpicks because that stuff gets in every crevice in your mouth you can imagine.  Makes for an attractive smile.  Lots of pepperoni, good quality cheese and a small is plenty for 2 people.  We'll definitely be getting this again the next time we're in town."
Went to Chicago for the first time and of course had to try some Chicago deep dish pizza.  My wife and I shared a meat lovers style pizza.  It was very good but the crust only covered about half the pizza on the bottom which was odd.  Flavor was very good though.  We also had fried mozzarella sticks and fried mushrooms and they were great.  We enjoyed the place overall but the pizza didn't quite live up to the hype.  Maybe we came on an off day...
"Pequod's is my favorite pizza in town.  They are the only place I enjoy that does multiple types - pan, stuffed, tossed - and they are all amazing to me to in their own way.  Its a fun place to watch the game, and they have good service.  Only issue is when you are seated downstairs at a two top and the bar gets to crowded if feels like you are being elbowed or someone might splash their drink on your pizza.  If you can sit upstairs, this is a great experience."
"Incredibly good pan pizza.  I only go here for the pizza, and don't usually get anything else.  This last time, got the appetizer combo and it was quite good (though all fried, for those who avoid such things).Took off one star because the ingredients were just extra-skimpy.  Otherwise, everything was great as always."
"One of my favorite pizza places in Chicago! I always try to take my guests here when they come visit Chicago. The atmosphere has a sports bar feel but is very family friendly. It's usually fairly busy so be sure to get there before the rush in order to get a table in a decent amount of time. Great pizza, good drink selection, clean and fun environment. Don't pass up this gem!"
I was raised on Home Run Inn and The original Giordano's on South California when it was BYOB. These were my childhood sweethearts. Both were outstanding pizzas in the late 70's but now that I'm older I have  found superior pie. Lou's and Geno's East are good but this is the place for the best. You forget life for a while while eating this magnificent offering. Well done Pequods
Best deep dish in Chicago! Caramelized crust FTW! Try giardiniera on it!
"BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE (I've eaten many pizzas in my day). Seriously, this is the Chicago-style experience everyone should have. The ONLY downfall to this place is that you may literally wait more than an hour to sit down, as it is SO busy and a little crammed inside because of that. Call-ahead seating is available though... So I DEFINITELY recommend this place! YUM!"
Sausage and Giardiniera caramelized crust pizza will be the best you've had in Chicago or ever!!!
The first thing I think of when someone says Chicago is PIZZA! My all time favorite food :)   So when my friends recommend pizza places I get excited to try them all.Pequods was 1st on my list. My favorite ingredient in a pizza is the sauce. The Saudi is what makes or breaks the pizza. & Pequods hit the spot. The pizza was absolutely delicious. I would have given the pizzeria 5 stars but the staff needs to be friendlier.
"Went year a while back for my birthday and absolutely enjoyed it. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was pretty cool.  We started with a party of 6 and ended up with 10 and they were more than accommodating.  The only reason this place is missing a star is because our waitress was acting like she had attitude because it was 10 of us and then when we asked for napkins, she literally brought us 5 napkins."
"It's soooo good! The sauce is not as chunky as other places and the crust isn't as thick as some of the others, but the emphasis here is on the toppings!! We got sausage, pepperoni, and black olives and it was sooooo good! The sausage was nice, high quality and there were stacks of pepperoni. Yum! The place is crazy busy, so definitely take advantage of their call ahead table service."
"Before visiting Pequod's, I officially completed the TRIFECTA! (Gino's, Giordano's and Lou's) I saved this place for last because I wanted to get all the other ""Famous Chicago Pizza Joint""s out of the way. I'm not going to write a full on review of this place because there are plenty here. But from the sauce to the cheese to the toppings (SAUSAGE) and to that flipping delicious cheese crust.. I will not be partaking in pizza eating anywhere else when I come to Chicago!! (Unless a local tells me about another hidden gem i MUST TRY) Pequod's is where I'll be!!"
"I didn't grow up in this city, I grew up with pizza chains.  Of all the pizza chains that were in my life, there was nothing that could top a pan pizza from Pizza Hut.  Chefs, employees, fans of Pequod's, please don't take offense to this statement....Pequods pizza is a Chicago Style Pizza Hut pan pizza on steroids.  I truly mean that in the highest compliment possible.We got a pan pizza the other night before seeing Ninja Turtles 3d.  Since we obviously weren't getting anchovies on the pizza (hardy har har), we decided on sausage and giardinera.  If you are a meat lover, be sure to go with sausage, as they throw HUGE chunks all up and in that pie.  I also liked how the crust was a little burnt on the sides, but not in a bad way.  I can only write so much about a pizza place, but I will say this place jumped up to one of my favorites in the city, go check it out if you haven't already."
"Top three pizzas in Chicago!  Period.  Always crowded whenever I go so expect waiting time but well worth the wait!  They're known for their crust.  Thin, slightly burnt, crispy!  Yum.  And I'm not a crust person at all."
"Our 30 minute pizza came out partially charred, but they remedied it with another (unfortunately, 30-minute) pizza. It tasted much better. I still would recommend."
"The pizza is insane good! I had the pizza and added onions,  mushrooms basil and jalapeño.  Was a interesting mix but actually worked nicely! We also had the jalapeño poppers and those were also great! The place was a recommendation from our can driver and it was a great suggestion! Here's a tip if you are traveling: talk to your cab drivers as a lot of them may have some great insights! After chatting with ours,  he used to be a sous chef at Michelin star restaurant and had some great suggestions for us when it came to food.  We weren't disappointed with any of his suggestions!"
"I've been going to Pequod's for years.  The pizza is AWESOME.  The restaurant is very cool on the inside.  They also have great lunch deals during the week.  Make sure you get the pan pizza with the ""caramelized"" cheese."
"So a friend of mine  that leave in Cali told me about this pizza place that I have never hear before. I decided to yelp it to see pic and reviews and when I saw they had more than a thousand reviews I was like this must be good place. Line was long but totally worth. We ordered a deep dish pepperoni, basil, meatball pizza and also garlic bread since a lot of people said were good. This was my first time there and won't be last one this pizza was just AMAZINGGGGGGGG for me so far best in chicago."
"This is the best deep dish in Chicago.  It is best to order take out as there is very little seating.  The service is good but when dining in it can be slow.  Overall if you are wanting deep dish pizza in Chicago, this is the place to go."
"Best deep dish pizza in town! Every person I have ever taken here loves the pizza. I've had people tell me they never liked deep dish till they had Pequod's. Do yourself a favor if you're here from out of town and want some good Chicago style pizza, please, please go to Pequod's. The lines can be quite long for dinner, so if you want to avoid them go for lunch."
So good! I love that this place delivers too. I love to get the deep dish with sausage and garlic. The crust is awesome and it's very filling.
"I've come to Pequod's multiple times, and as a chicago deep dish pizza lover, I'd give Pequod's number 1 for pizza. It's disappointing though because their service has been less than mediocre almost every time I've gone. I understand the wait times, it's a popular place, of course on a Saturday night you'll have to wait. I understand the long wait for the pizza, I mean it's a thick, delicious circle of goodness! But while waiting for your pie to come out it would be nice to be actually waited on. I had only 1 drink while waiting over an hour and a half for our pizza. Had our waitress (who we only saw once at the beginning) come by more frequently, myself and my party would have ordered plenty of drinks. We didn't even get refills of our water. After complaining the manager did give us a discount which was much appreciated. The pizza is soo delicious I of course will be back, but just a heads up, give yourself lots of time and don't expect a lot out of the waitstaff."
"Great deep dish pizza. I've been to a number of really good Chicago pizza places. Pequods is hands down the best. I liked the laid back atmosphere, beer selection and staff. Get there early or late, it's gets crowded."
"I'm not in love with deep dish pizza, but this is my favorite of the thicker style in Chicago, probably because it's actually pan pizza. This means that the crust gets nice and caramelized, which adds textural contrast and helps it not to be all mushy. Pequods also makes phenomenal meatballs - worth a detour just for them."
My favorite deep dish in Chicago.  Second favorite thin crust pizza.  Definitely a place I need to bring people visiting Chicago.
"Best deep dish in the city, you'll never go back to lous or giordanos after eating here."
Holy cow! Amazing pizza! I think this is the best in Chicago! The service is bad (I really mean bad) but the food is worth it. I think the secret is in the unwashed pans they use to cook the pizza.
"Amazing, amazing, amazing!  There is nothing left I can say about Pequod's that hasn't already been said by the other 1,100 reviewers.  The caramelized crust, the pan blackened bottom, and the secret sauce are the 3 components that make this the best deep dish in Chicago. Seating can be tricky on a busy night and the pizza can take a while to come out at times but to me this is all just part of Pequod's personality and vibe.  Pizza this delicious shouldn't be made too easy to get, so the long wait only adds to the appreciation of the magic.There are times where I wake up salivating from dreaming about the Pequod's tomato sauce and that blackened and buttery crust.  If you haven't tried Pequod's yet, then do yourself a favor and go there immediately!"
Pizza is freaking amazing!  Unique crust and great flavored sauce.  Right near Wrigley!  Go! Go! Go! Highly recommend!
Fantastic pizza. Incredible crust. Definitely one of my favorite places
I love pizza and more importantly i love deep dish sausage pizza and pequods is so awesome...this carmelized crust is too die for. Ive been to a lot of pizza places and I'm counting this one as one of my favorites and i will be back
"6 years ago I hated deep dish pizza (and yes, I'm am a Chicagoan born and raised), HOWEVER, when my wife brought me to Pequods in 2008 my taste buds experienced a moment of pure ecstasy that only a perfect Chicago deep dish pizza can create! We had a sausage and spinach deep dish pizza and my mind was blown! Alas, I have been forever ruined. When I eat regular pizza I think of only Pequods and how I could be experiencing something better. When I'm eating there I never wanna leave. My fat soul has been won over by their incredibly, mind changing recipe and all I wanna do is shout out their amazing-ness from the top of the Sears tower (I refuse to call it the ""W"" word)! Anyways, please don't give up on deep dish till you have tried Peqouds... I DARE YOU!!!! Muahhaahaahhaaaaa!!!!!"
Caramelized onion crust deep dish pizza!  Phenomenal is an understatement!
"Simply the best. There's just not much else to say about Pequods. Coming from the south side of Chicago, I find it very difficult to get a delicious za basically anywhere north of 87th. But....Pequods is the exception. I've been here many a time and it never disappoints. Basically stick to pizza and beers here. They don't take reservations really so plan accordingly. It gets crowded if there is a big game on, but trust me it's worth the wait. Personal favs=mushroom+sausage and the pepperoni+pepperoncini. But really, come to think of it, their veggie is killer too! IN SHORT, ALL ZA HERE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you have not been to Pequods yet, I highly suggest you get there ASAP for good food and good times."
"Went here with friends this past weekend.  Even though we did a call ahead we had to wait two hours to get a table.  They were telling walk-ins that it would be over three hours, and I had no idea why someone would wait so long for pizza.  Now I completely understand.  This was easily the best Chicago-style pizza I have ever had, and I've been to a number of places that are ""the best"".  Pequod's blew it out of the water.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago, but I'll probably do carry out."
"Hands down the best Chicago style deep dish pizza AND lunch special in the city! Monday- Friday until 3pm, you can order a personal pizza and a soda/draft beer for a measly $5!  You can't beat that!But let's talk about what makes the pizza magical. It's all in the crust! How I have dreamed of only devouring the crust! It will blow your mind! Everyone that I know who has experienced the magic of Pequods will agree. Also, considering that Pequods is also a bar, you wouldn't expect top quality customer service, but that's what I have gotten here.  I don't eat pork but love pepperoni...turkey that is. I actually called Pequods and asked them if they would be ok with me brining in my own turkey pepperoni. Most restaurants have never obliged, but Pequods was more Han happy to meet my request. I was pleasantly surprised and even more enamored by the delicious food but wonderful customer service. Oh, they now deliver and even delivered to my home though I was a little outside their delivery range because they weren't busy at that moment. That's customer service at its best!"
"Great Chicago deep dish. It's fun atmosphere, your typical Chicago pizza joint. Lots of wood, stuff about sports, booths, etc. The waitstaff is incredibly nice. My friend lost her phone into the abyss of a crack in between the wall and a booth and they were very nice to fish it out for her. We ordered mozzarella sticks and a salad (in our poor attempt to have something healthy), which were good. We also did a couple slices of the thin crust (because none of us had ever tried it before). We ordered 2 deep dishes, and since there was 6 of us, we had plenty to take home. The sausage is incredible on the pizza and all the veggies are fresh and crisp, even after being in the oven. It's a must if you are visiting the city."
"You WILL wait two days for a table BUT the pizza IS THAT good. Don't let the sad, sad table assigner put you off. Now a must-do on all Chicago trips."
"We were told Pequod's has some of the best deep dish Chicago-style pizza in the whole city. Coming from the East Coast, we were excited to try it. Although the restaurant is known to be packed on the weekends, we easily got a table on a Monday evening. Each additional topping was $2.75, which seemed like a lot considering we only ordered pepperoni and black olive. Pequod's famously uses old cast iron pans that have been blackened over the years, allowing the crust and the cheese to melt together and form a crispy caramelized layer. We learned that ""deep-dish"" at Pequod's refers to a thick bottom crust, as opposed to ""stuffed"" deep dish where your chosen topics are incorporated inside the pizza. Pequod's was a great introduction to Chicago-style deep dish."
"came here for dinner on a weekend, thankfully we didn't have to wait too long. We were sat upstairs in a huge comfy booth and the pizza was absolutely delicious"
"With almost 1800 reviews adding more of the same is redundant, this is great pizza.Take it from me, order extra sauce and cheese because the deep dish is pretty doughy."
17 years in the city and this is hands down my favorite pizza!!! Amazing flavor and the caramelized crust (which looks burnt) is the BEST part!!
"Definitely order the pan pizza. The thin crust was just average. We ordered sausage, mushroom, and spinach, and it was delish. The wait time nearly killed me, over an hour to bring out our pizzas, but I was starving. I think I actually prefer Giordanos because it has the extra sauce and the layers, but this was also phenomenal. Chicago deep dish delish."
"I love deep dish and before going here it was hard to find a place that can compete with Lou Malnati's. This place definitely does. The pizza styles are still different both the pan pizza at Pequod's was delicious. I am excited to go back and have another.  Plus, the prices were very reasonable.  Go early as you can pretty much guarantee there will be a wait!"
2nd favorite pizza place. Burt's is my number 1 but I still suggest this place to people who aren't from here.
"I visited Pequod's on my first trip to Chicago after attempting unsuccessfully to get into uber-famous Lou Malnati's, which was jam-packed on a Friday night at 8PM. I wasn't going to wait 2 hours for pizza, so a friend who lives in the city suggested we try the less-famous Pequods.I am so glad we tried this place instead. We still had to wait an hour to be seated (this is after calling ahead for what I was told was ""priority seating"" and a 25 minute wait), but it was worth it. And, seriously, if you're getting pizza on a Friday night, you should expect heavy wait times.Our party of 4 ordered a medium deep dish pizza. The men in our group protested the idea of such a ""small"" pie, but the ladies were glad we stuck to our guns. 6 pieces of deep dish glory was plenty to go around.Our pan pizza had mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni on it. The crust was crunchy and delicious at first, though it did get soggy after a few minutes. But I have no complaints. The burnt cheese around the edge of this pizza was sublime.And the sausage:  Oh, the sausage. It was soft and casing-free (score! I hate chewing on sausage casings), and had a lovely hint of fennel. I've never tasted such yummy sausage.I wished there was more cheese, but I'm not complaining. This was my first Chicago pizza, and it was pretty darn good."
"The pizza. What can I say?  It's honestly freaking delicious.  Now, I am not one to stand on a soapbox and diatribe daily about the superiority of pizza to other foods. Because usually- I wouldn't eat pizza if you paid me.  But here... This pizza is seriously delicious.We came on a Friday evening, it was jammed pack. More sardines than in a old Soviet tin but we held on to our patience and stalked the guests at the bar for their seat like hawks.  It's the only way to eat in a halfway reasonable amount of time- say an hour. But a good 2 hours later, when the pizza finally came.  It melted away my angry.  You say, oh it must be the joy of alleviating hungry after such a long wait.  But no sir- I kindly filled my gluttony with wings and salad.  But let's get back to the main point- the pizza was the bombdiggity.  The crust was thick but not soggy.  Cheese, this could be improved as I could barely taste it. But the toppings.  Oh the toppings! Seriously made you want to slap your female paternal unit- yes it was that good.  Dense, packed and meatballs the size of fists- it definitely didn't leave you wanting.Trust me. Coming from someone who literally lives to eat and studies taste like the Quran, if you ever feel the need for pizza.  You will not regret eating here, as long you can survive the painful waiting."
Pequod's has been by far the best restaurant that I've been to in Chicago. I had the fries for an appetizer which were excellent. And the deep dish took a while to cook but it was obviously homemade and was indescribably delicious. The servers were friendly but were not on top of out drinks and napkins. But overall great experience.
Great neighborhood pizza joint.  I love their deep dish pizza.  The place gets crowded very quickly so plan accordingly
"Best deep dish in town. Careful on the weekend or during a Hawks game because it gets really crowded. You can duck into the Drinking Bird next door while you wait though, so at least you've got options."
"I love this place. If you are looking for a good Chicago style pizza, this place is worth checking out. I like it better than Lou's, and that is when I really like Lou's as well."
"I was so impressed with Pequods, but not for typical reasons.  Obviously their pizza is something that everyone raves about-and I agree.  But the service was also fantastic.  I had a group of 20 people going on a Saturday night for my birthday.  A lot of restaurants have an attitude when you have this many people and I sometimes they still make you wait or even lose reservations all together.  Although Pequod's walk-in wait was 2 hours, my reservation was brought right to the front and seated right away.  Within minutes our waitress was taking orders and accommodating my party.  She was so friendly and made us feel welcome despite how busy and crowded the restaurant was.  This is so rare and so appreciated! Since then, I have been back and will continue to dine there."
"I am a fan.  If you're looking to change up the normal Chicago deep dish routine, Pequod's is the place to go.  I ordered a deep dish pizza with sausage, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Let me tell ya... it was tastey.  The crush is nice and thick, a little less crunchy than Lou's and definitely more pizza for each slice.  The best part about it was that it all looked like one big, happy pizza.  All the ingredients had great proportion and I will definitely come back!"
"My buddies took me here 8 years ago to try the ""caramelized crust"" deep dish pizza. I haven't been able to stay away since! The deep dish has that homemade, fresh ingredient taste to it. Hearty yet light enough to make you keep grabbing for more slices. Great, garlicky tomato sauce. Cheese that's not too greasy. Darn... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Go here. You will enjoy it I promise."
My favorite pizza. Case closed. There is nothing else to even discuss other than the fact that you WILL regret it for the rest of your life if you do not come here.
This is one of my favorite pizza spots in Chicago! I always order extra pepperoni and extra sauce on my pizza and it's amazing! I have never had a bad meal here!
"The best deep dish in the city. Don't agree with me, well your wrong and you're probably a damn New Yorker. The crust is fluffy and the the cheese ring completes the experience. The awesome sauce is just the icing on This triumph of gastronomy."
"Pizza was awesome. The deep dish was to as good as it gets. We ordered a gardinara, pepperoni, sausage and meatball pie.The cheesy bread was delicious, service was great and overall was amazing meal.  Highly recommend to anyone who liked Deep Dish, or want to try Deep Dish Pizza."
"Came here with my cousins, brother and sis-in-law on a chilly Saturday night.  After about 90 minutes and a cocktail at The Drinkingbird next door, we were seated at a rather tight table for our group of 6 -- but we made it work. We started with an order of Pequods Salad and Cheesy Garlic Bread to shared.  Then, shared a large veggie pan pizza and a large meat pan pizza and washed them down with some pitchers of Blue Moon.  Everything was delicious and our waitress was extremely sweet and patient.  Atmosphere was loud and fun -- overall great night for some Chicago pie."
"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I love Chicago deep-dish pizza and I wish LA really had some awesome places to eat it at but we don't sadly. My cousins introduced me to deep dish pizza back when I first visited Illinois in 2006 and ever since then I've always wanted it in LA. This place makes just perfect pizza. Nothing else needs to be said. We sat on the second floor and had great service. I really wish they could send me some pizza right about now cause I'm really craving it. Anyways, ambiance was cool and the only thing I didn't like was the crummy Blackhawks sign when you come down the stairwell (Go Kings)..but I am in their territory so I can't be mad! Also, the painted wizard in the upstairs bathroom just adds more character to the place. I found that extremely cool too! Will be back when I'm in Chicago again."
Love the pizza here. I don't know if it was because I was ravenous or that the food was really that good but I dream of Pequod's pizza all the time!
"Best deep dish in the city. If you're not from Chicago you need to come here for deep dish! If you are from Chicago you need to come here for deep dish!! I absolutely love how crunchy the caramelized crust is. They're not stingy on the toppings either! Expect a wait, but have no fear it's all worth it!"
I just have to say best deep dish in Chicago  1.Pequods  2. Lou Malnati's 3. Gino's East.
"OMG!  Pequod's pan pizza is so delicious!  Just be prepared to wait a little longer than expected for your food on game days. But, well worth the wait!"
"Went there for a final stop of a pub crawl. Service was fun and entertaining. Appetizers were good, especially the wings. Great deep dish. The cheesy  crust is one of the best. What a great spot."
"I got a pizza for pick up last weekend. They open at 11am on Saturdays, but I called at 10:45 to see if I could place the order and they were ready to start taking orders. Pizza was ready at 11:30am sharp. Thanks!"
"I stopped in for lunch and with this being my 1st time I sorted thru the reviews to help me make my decision. I opted for the $ 4.95 lunch special that included a personal pan pizza and a soda. I had a sausage pizza which was highly recommended and added pepperoni with extra cheese. The additional toppings were extra. It came out in about 30 minutes and I was impressed with the sausage""s flavor, pepperoni was meh, extra cheese was also a good choice as always. The crust was very crispy around the edges and caramelized cheese set it the f off."
"I have been to Pequod's so many times! This is the place to go get your pizza.  Service can be slow at times but mostly because they are always packed (which is a good sign) .They make one of the few deep dish pizza I actually like, extensive drinking menu, and TVs all around for you to follow that game you like so much."
My favorite deep dish in Chicago. The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for a pizza place. and they let you order your deep dish when you put your name in so the wait time once you sit down is minimal. Sometimes I dream about the caramelized crust...
"Best deep dish pizza in the city, hands down.Get literally anything and it'll be awesome. Staff is friendly and outgoing, area is nice, upstairs seating is pretty nifty, and the food is amazing if I haven't already mentioned.I'm not even kidding... I noticed their fountain soda just tastes better than other fountain sodas. They must have a really good water purification system for making their pizza dough? Just a guess, but I bet I'm right!Oh also! If you get your pizza wrapped up to go, they put aluminum foil around it. This impressed the hell out of me because I've always done that to my pizza when I bring it home anyway. Well done Pequod's, well done."
"Best deep dish in Chicago! Only slightly more amazing than lou's, because of the bubbly crispy cheese crust."
Awesome pizza i'm not a big deep dish Pearson but i love this pizza .The caramelized crust is the best .tell your friends it's the real deal.
"Order the deep dish sausage pizza. They have other things on the menu, but if this is not part of your order, then don't even go here. It is sooooo good and nobody in chicago does it like them!!"
"At the time of this writing, Peaquod's has 1568 reviews, the majority of which are four and five stars. I doubt there's anything I can say that hasn't already been mentioned. I've heard a lot about this place from various people who claimed that it was one of the best pizza joints in the city. Today I finally tried it. You know all that hype you've heard about this place? It's all true."
"I called ahead at lunch yesterday for a large pan pizza, and it was nicely packaged and piping hot 40 minutes later.  Staff was friendly.  Parking easy at lunch.  The pizza was quite good.  Not the best ever but flavorful (nice sauce and sausage).  Decent pizza."
"Came in here for lunch. Had there lunch special which is a personal pizza, salad and drink for $5-6 bucks. When I came on a Friday afternoon, place was busy. Sat at the bar with some coworkers so we didn't have to wait as long. The guy at the bar was really friendly and helped us with our order. I'm from SoCal and pizza is def my favorite thing to eat so Chicago style was a must to get when in town. Thought pizza was excellent. It reminded me of what Chicago style pizza is about. This place does get crowded and service can run a little on the slow side so be prepared. Overall good experience."
"Definitely a tasty deep dish spot. I wasn't thrilled with the service - it felt like it took us forever to get drinks, and then forever again to order. Once we actually got our food they were pretty attentive, though. Somewhat limited drink selection, but it's definitely worth a try!"
"I had always heard about Pequod's from all my friends, but never went. FINALLY, I went and had the pizza. I will have to agree with everyone that it really is great pizza! Highly recommend checking it out!"
"Loved this place. Have been here a couple of times. It's always crowded. Great, great pizza."
"If you are in the Lincoln Park/DePaul area, you really need to check out Pequod's Pizzeria.  Until yesterday, I've never been but some friends were hungry after seeing a move at the Regal Webster Place 11 (which is across the street) and they have been here several times,When you approach this ""hole-in-the-wall"" pizzeria, you may want to walk right past it since it's among other stores.  Once inside, you'll be ""greeted"" by the ""self- important"" hostess.   We were seated at a great table by the door - no big deal.  It was a great table to watch people and watch sports on the many tvs.The restaurant is long and narrow with plenty of booths and small tables for two.  Towards, the back by the kitchen, there were larger tables that could be larger groups - not to large.  The bar was also very accessible for those waiting for a table.  I could image this place get packed on the weekends.The server was very pleasant and very inattentive.  Never overbearing.  Yes, the servers wear sports shirts or t-shirts but it fit in the atmosphere, which is very casual, sports bar, family neighborhood place.  I noticed a lot of carry outs which is a good sign.For as steady as the restaurant was, the pizzas came to our table in a reasonable amount of time.  My buddies had the deep dish with just about everything on it and I had the thin crust with pepperoni which was excellent!  The deep dish looked just as good and as much as they ate, it must have been also good.   The sauce was just right...not to spicy and not overbearing.  Looking forward trying the deep dish next time.The prices are very reasonable for the area.So if you are the neighborhood, I would highly recommend that you check this place out!"
"Best pizza on the universe - this place is no joke.As a Chicago native (and pizza lover) transplanted to the west coast, any time a friend is headed to Chicago and asks me where to eat this is where I send them.  This is not your touristy Gino's, Uno, Lou Malnati's type pizza - this is a legit locals only spot."
PIZZA.IS.DELICIOUS. don't be tempted by apps just go for the pizza!!!! :heart:
Pequod's to me is the real authentic CHICAGO deep dish pizza!!! The caramelized crust is to die for! Absolutely a must for those people looking to eat the best of the best deep dish!
"A virgin to Chiciago's deep dish pizza, I was thoroughly impressed - almost. The almost is that I'd recommend they serve sides of sauce to dip the extra thick crust in. But, that's just my own personal preference. Expect  to wait at least 45 minutes when ordering a deep-dish pizza (it just takes awhile to bake) but expect to fill your stomach with one epic slice! (maybe two if you're really hungry!) The crush is absolutely amazing. At first glance it looks burnt, but, oh so good! This place is popular so if you time it right you may be seated right away, otherwise you are probably looking at a 1-2 hour wait, especially on a weekend.The ambiance is a darker and slightly loud setting with dark wood tables and a ""bar like"" feel to it. Overall a casual, young, trendy and fun for all ages restaurant. The service was smooth and friendly."
Best deep dish in Chicago if you like crust more than sauce. Their crust is soft and crunchy... It's really good!
"These guys do deep dish right! I got the personal size pizza with pepperoni and olives. After I ordered, I feared they would overdo it with the olives like some places, but they keep the olives to a moderate amount. The crust! It was amazing. The carmelized cheese was delicious and the pizza in general was solid."
"Although it's a bit different from your traditional Chicago style deep dish, Pequods pan pizza is my favorite when I am craving pizza.  The way they sprinkle the crust with cheese to create the burnt cheese on the edge of the crust is unique and delicious.  They have great appetizers - wings are solid.  Stop by the Drinkingbird if there is a long line on the weekends, it's the bar right near it which is awesome as well.If I could eat Pequod's every day and not get fat I would do it without thinking twice.Lately we have been getting pinapple, onion, and canadian bacon.  In the past I usually stuck to sausage, spinach and mushroom.  Yum."
"One of my favorites in the city for sit down real pizza in the pan type of place. Love the food, hate the wait. This is beyond good pizza and a rare take on a crust. You need to try it to understand. You should give this at least one try and you will be hooked - pepperoni is the best! Like Gino's East but better! Great service but can be very long wait for a table - call ahead to check on wait time no reservations accepted on some nights. Forget a game night service will lack. Parking is tough, they have a location in Morton Grove which is even a longer wait but easier parking."
"Pequod's is the only ""pan"" pizza my family eats, definitely a landmark restaurant!"
"Pequod's is super loud and incredibly busy, but it's worth it. Their pizza is my favorite in the city known for stuffed pizza."
"BEST pizza in Chicago hands down. It's the perfect combination between thin and the traditional deep dish Chicago pizza, it's a not too thick pan style pizza with crunchy cheese melted on the crust. It's pure perfection. Add meatballs to your pizza, you won't be disappointed!"
Not deep dish pizza but the best pan pizza you are going to get in the area. The lunch special is the ways to go.
"I am a huge fan of deep dish and this spot is one of the best in Chicago.A lot of deep dish places in the city are chains, even some of the best ones, but this one is not which gives it a ton of street cred.Lets start with their crust, a very important part of any pizza, especially deep dish.It's amazing. It's thinner than most and although it may look burnt it's actually just blackened with tons and tons of flavor so don't skip eating it.The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni (the last pizza I got from here) blended together in a perfect mix of flavors and textures that only deep dish could.Their ingredients taste fresh and are very flavorful. Some of the better pepperoni I have had in my life.Will order from here again, guaranteed."
"You can't beat their deep dish. My favorite deep dish pizza for sure. When my manfriend lived in Chicago, I would beg to go to this place! It's always packed, so you order your pizza, and then when it's ready, they seat you. It's somewhat chaotic sometimes, but grab a beer and relax! :-) Even though you don't get seated till the pizza is done, it's always piping hot!"
"Definitely the best Chicago style pizza I've had. Something about that cheesy caramelized dough that gets all crispy and wonderful. Also, one of the best lunch deals ever, if you've got the time to spare. Can't speak to more than the lunch portion of pizza, but why should I need to? This is a Chicago pizza place, and that's what they do and they do it really well. My go to is extra cheese and extra sauce, can't go wrong."
Pequot's makes me want to go back to Chicago!!!! When I visited Chicago we asked every uber/lyft/local from Chicago where the best deep dish pizza was and everyone geared us toward Lou Malnati's or Giordano's Pizzeria. So we tired all of them and hands down Pequot's was the best deep dish in Chicago!!!! loved it!
"The meatballs were amazing on this pan dish pizza. The crust was extremely buttery and cheesy, however, I do prefer a deep dish pizza as opposed to the pan pizza that they have here, it's just all about preference.  It was a nice change especially as I pigged out on Chicago deep dish pizzas for about 3-4 weekends in a row.  Don't judge!  ;P"
"Yes. Best pizza in Chicago. Its a hike from a train station, but the whole walk back I'm thinking, ""that was delicious."" Not that I sit around talking about food with my friends often, but Pequods is a regular topic of conversation among a group of friends I have."
"On my visit to Chicago I made it my business to try every single deep dish pizza there is. Pequod's takes the prize. Skip the others - this is the deep dish that you want!My bartender also made my jack and coke pretty strong, so there's another plus."
"I was told by a local restaurant owner (not pizza) that no one in Chicago eats deep dish pizza. That it's only there for the tourists. That might be true, but I was a tourist at the moment. I arrived at Pequod's at 11:30am on a weekday and this place was packed within 40 minutes. This was exactly what I was looking for coming to town to experience some local pizza. I love deep dish, well I love pizza and deep dish being a type. Pequod's is everything. The slightly dive bar ambiance and awesome staff add to it's brilliance. The brilliance being their pizza. Perfect quantity and flavored sauce balances the amount of cheese on the pie. The cheese is brought right to the edge of the pan and then forms the best cheese crust around the edges. The bit everyone wants from the lasagna pan. This touch was so great I ate these slices sideways. Adding to the balance was the crunchy crust slightly between the famous places in town holding this beast up. Perquod's is really how I would like to eat for a visit. Something that is authentic; place, people and food. I wish I had more time and appetite to have sought out more of these types of places while in town, but there is always next time. Pequod's will keep me coming back."
"Pretty darn good deep dish if you ask me! I've been to Gino's as well but I think this place takes the cake. The burned cheese is everything that a cheese lover such as myself could ask for, and the staff is friendly and very well versed in the pizza cutting world."
best pizza and hang out place . best place to invite your out of state visitors to try Chicago style pizza .
"Best pizza in the city. Hands down. Deep dish, thin crust, you name it. Some people complain about the wait but honestly, there wouldn't be a wait if it wasn't worth it. Atmosphere in the restaurant itself is old school Chicago. Great for delivery or dine-in. Quality sauce, quality toppings...this is it if you're coming to Chicago looking for a good pie."
"THE BEST PAN PIZZA IN CHICAGO!!!(or deep dish if you think it's deep dish, but really it's pan)Caramelized cheese crust is all i need to say."
"This is one of the best pizza places in Chicago.  The place is always busy so show up early to get your name in.I would say pass on the appetizers.  the appetizers are bar quality, but the pizza definitely makes up for it!"
"Even though Lou's just opened a new location in my hood (Lincoln Square), my first love will always be Pequod's! I wish they took reservations so I could better plan around movie start times across the street, but I'll always return for the za!"
"Unlike many places around the city, this place is completely worth the wait (or ordering from home and having it delivered). Skip the touristy places like Uno, Due, Malnati's, and Gino's (unless you like 2"" thick gummy dough). Great beer, great staff (sometimes caddy, sometimes straight to the point), and, of course, amazing pizza."
Best deep dish in Chicago! The ingredients are super fresh! The waiters are hottttt. The cheesy crust is bomb. Go there.
they sat a party of 3 before us even though we saw that party walk in and request their buzzer... even though we were there 1st... need to keep their buzzers functioning.
"Best. Pizza. In. Chicago! The sausage and deep dish is a must. I used to think Lou Malnati's was king, but every reign has its end. Side note: Giordanos is not even top 5 compared to Pequods deep dish. The sauce and carmelized crust at Pequods is beyond this galaxy. *** lunch special which consists of a personal deep dish and soft drink is only $5! Unreal GO!"
"It's my first time in Chicago by way of San Francisco and my girlfriend found this place on yelp. Gotta say, this pizza is HELLA bomb. Definitely set the standard for Chicago style deep dish pizza. GO GIANTS/49ERS/WARRIORS/SHARKS....hehe :D"
"Great deep dish! Our waitress was super unfriendly which is the reason no 5 stars. Also, we had a reservation but we still has to wait 20 minutes. Be careful of you have a show to get to because the pizzas take an hour to be made. Delicious though if you like deep dish."
MMM mmmm! Finally came here after hearing about it from lots of people- it hasn't disappointed. I have only had the pan pizza- and that cheese crust is SO good. Service can be slow but my husband and I have taken to calling in our order ahead which speeds up the process a bit. Overall we've never had a bad pizza there. It can get crowded so try to call in for a table. Lots of TVs if you want to watch a game. Pequods has turned into our deep-dish default pizza place (and we do Piece when we want thin crust!).
"One of the best pizza pies I've had in a really long time! It's in-between deep dish and thin crust, of course more thick than thin. Their sauce and toppings were excellent but the crust steals the show!"
"If you're not into the really saucy stuffed pies like at Giordanos and Pizzeria Uno/Duo, this is a great deep dish pizza! The dough is fluffy and tasty, and the toppings are excellent!The appetizers were normal run of the mill fried bar foods, and the drinks were standard. Overall the atmosphere is solid and the place appears to be able to accommodate decent large groups."
"Pizza was fabulous!  I could've eaten 300 slices, but settled for the individual pie.  Service was incredibly slow, but perhaps this was because we were the only party upstairs and they forgot about us?  It's ok, I won't hold a grudge because the pizza is so damn good.  I also enjoyed watching the Olympics on the several HD flat screens they have hanging throughout the joint."
The best deep dish in the city! Be prepared to wait for a table but it's worth it.
$5 for a deep dish pizza lunch! Perfect crunch. There was a good amount of sauce and cheese. It is definitely fresh pizza so its a pretty long wait. It was a good 25 minutes before the pizzas came out.
Was surprised by my boyfriend with a night at Pequod's. Had the deep dish which was amazing. The carmelized cheese from the seasoned pans was so delicious. The staff was courteous and extremely professional. Everyone was smiling - employees and customers! Can't wait to go back.
"I waited almost two hours to eat at this place, AND IT WAS WORTH IT.My Chicago friend warned me that this place could have crazy lines, but I was all like ""Worse lines than NYC? Psh, Impossible!"" Nope. Definitely possible. There was a Blackhawks game on and the place was packed. We had some beers at the bar and put in our order with the hostess stand; the pizzas take like 30-45 minutes to make, so it's smart to put in an advance order.This was my first authentic Chicago-style pizza (Uno's doesn't count), and it's enough to make me question Jon Stewart's epic NYC-versus-Chicago-Deep-Dish rant. Maybe it IS an above-ground marinara swimming pool, but encased into an impossibly crispy pan crust and loaded down with so much cheese and sausage and olives and mushrooms. Quite the dramatic presentation when the server thunks it down on the table. A small pizza was too much food for the two of us. I still dream about this place."
My favorite Chicago Pan Pizza! Yum! Crust melts in your mouth. Fresh delicious toppings and cold beer!
"Went a few months back and never got around to reviewing.Probably the best pizza I've ever had and I've had most of them.  The restaurant was really cool.My only disclaimer is that if you don't like things a little burnt, this may not be your favorite pizza.  The cheese is burnt, er I mean 'caramelized'.  But I love that."
"Definitely worth the (probably insane) wait to get a table. The pizza is delicious and so much better than other places. I love the carmelized cheese crust. Plus, it's across the street from the Webster Place theater, so it's great to go out for pizza and a movie."
"Hands down, this is the BEST PIZZZA IN CHICAGO. Don't let anyone tell you different. I always bring out of town guests here to have a true pizza experience that can't be found anywhere else. The pizzas are well worth the wait, and the crust is a sure fire winner."
wow. the deep dish is really something to write home about the front of house staff is pretty crappy though
Great place - authentic Chicago deep dish!Really nice place to chill out on the weekends.
"Pequod's has my favorite chicago style pizza. Their crust is perfection. It's buttery and light without being soggy which I often find to be a problem with some deep dish pizzas. The servers are great and friendly. On one occasion I did run into a host that seemed to be a bit of a ditz but besides that, the service is good."
While visiting Chicago I asked a group Chicago's best (under cover police) who had the best deep dish pizza in the city - Pequod's!  I was not disappointed. Service was good and the sauce had a great flavor.
"The only thing that makes this pizza good is the carmelized edge.  Other than that it's like eating a big doughy cake disguised with cheese and red sauce.  They did put up with us tourists changing our reservation multiple times, so extra points for their patience."
I ordered a 12 inch Peperoni & onion pan pizza. The crust is really thick and tastey. The 12 inch is the perfect size for two hungry people...just enough for leftovers :P only downside was that we had to wait an hour and fifteen minutes but it was so good and so worth the wait! You know what they say.. you have to wait for the best things in life amirite?! FIVE STARS! Go pequods!
My favorite deep-dish Pizza. The sausage is the way to go. Plus it's nice that they will deliver both to my work and home... neither of which are exactly close to the restaurant.
Great thin crust pizza. Fresh toppings love the sausage.  I personally dont recommend the  deep dish tho..
"I'm from the east coast, so clearly I think you all are weird neophytes for thinking pie is pizza. However, Pequod's is the absolute best, and I refuse to let weird pie you people call pizza pass my lips unless it is from Pequod's."
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Best part is the crust.Most after midnight pizza places are horrendous, this place has amazing deep dish pizza. I've ordered after 1am before and the quality is on point.I am kind of bummed I don't live in Chicago to order a pie right now!"
My favorite pizza! :)
"Great pizza near the wrigleyille area. The best part of this pizza is the crust, they cook it till it Browns on top I think it's the cheese crusting on it but it's sop good. In comparison to the other Chicago pizza I have had on my vacation, this place is less cheese than Giordano's, peqouds is more tomato saucy. The crust is crispy that other places but has a sweet taste similar to Gino's East. I definitely recommend trying this place. It's also a chill bar to drink in and watch a game. It's a Blackhawks bar."
Not much else to say other than best deep dish in Chicago! This is where I take friends and family visiting Chicago to get pizza. Can't beat that caramelized crust!
"Well it's official I have a new favorite Chicago deep dish pizza and it's Pequods!Every place claims to have the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, but there can only be one winner and that winner is Pequods. I came here with my girlfriend and we got a deep dish pizza with sausage and giardiniera that was simply amazing.This place is well worth the wait and I guarantee you will not be disappointed in Pequods deep dish pizza!"
"Gets busy and the pan pizzas take time so plan ahead. I like the option to do toppings to just half of the pizza to get variety. We opted for Canadian bacon and pineapple on one side, and pepperoni and green peppers on the other side. The crust is Carmelized and so so good. We ordered a medium which was 6 huge slices. It was way too much. I'd like to come back and try the thin crust. That looked good also. Service was friendly."
Good pizza. Love the lunch special. Love the burnt cheese crust.Art C
"WOW is all I can say. This place is amazing. I grew up in Chicago and have had pizza from all the best places, at least I thought so until last night. We had a small group of 3 couples and everyone (2 Canadians and 4 Chicagoans) thought this was the best pizza we have ever had.  We tried a Deepdish and a thin crust. While I prefer a thinner, thin crust the crust was amazing. The deep dish had the caramelized crust which was a first for us all, and we thought it was really good.Our server was just as good as the pizza, friendly and attentive."
"My favorite deep dish pizza in the city, hands down. The burnt crust is actually perfection. It takes awhile for delivery, but it is well worth it."
Pequod's was some of the best deep dish pizza i've ever had - they load on toppings. We got mozzarella sticks and cheesy bread as an app (both average) and then a few deep dish pizzas. We got a veggie pizza and a pepperoni pizza - both were so good I could have killed myself by eating too much. Thankfully I finally stopped but I definitely want to go again!
Terrific deep dish pizza! We were seated immediately and the pizza didn't take too long to come out. Great service as well. Fun place on game nights!
"Excellent, excellent pizza. The sausage is to die for. The restaurant is busy and it will take some time for your food. Luckily, they have Goose Island Green Line on tap to help you pass the time. The pizza is very filling, I'd suggest not filling up on Appetizers before hand. They will happily box up leftovers, and proper Chicago pizza  should always be reheated in an oven, not the microwave! Highly recommended, just try to avoid the busiest times."
"Came to Chicago to stuff my face and see the sights and ended up in flavor town.I'd heard about this spot and had to give it try since they specifically bake it with cheese on top to give it a nice crunch! I made the long trek from Millennium Park ( yes, i was being touristy...sue me :P ) to a neighborhood that put the urban in suburban and plopped my hungry hungry hippo a$$ down in this bad boy.  My friend and I were immediately greeted by a cute waitress and offer drinks (+1) We ordered up some some local brews and and a shared a medium Pepperoni, Sausage, & Mushroom pie. Th wait was about 20 minutes, in the meantime we watched as local after local came through, and perused their decor. Cools dive bar-ish like feel without the same crowd..and smell ^.^ The pizza was came out piping hot and overloaded with toppings! The real coup de grace was the delectable crispity crunchy blackened lasagna-like (in a good way!!) cheesy crust!I wolfed down 3 slices and called it quits...I would have loved to sit around for another beer or two and finish off the rest, but all good things must come to an end. Plus I had reservations for L20, but that's a different story and review all together."
"I can't believe the wait time for this place. I used to come here back in the day and be seated immediately for my deep dish cravings. Regardless, it's the only place I'll come for deep dish when visiting Chicago. I think their service is really great for how swamped they are on a consistent basis. Their appetizers aren't much to write home about - but I'll usually get the fried zucchini so I can nosh on something while I wait 50 minutes for my Pizza."
"Moving cross country from Philly to Seattle,  passing through Chicago and per the previous reviews decided to stop here for deep dish - and it did not disappoint. Simple pepperoni pie was prefect;  and Italian beef with fresh basil (ordered on a whim) was delicious. I could not grant the final star, because of the wait staff.  Impersonal,  inattentive,  and  unknowledgeable (about the freshness/quality of ingredients)... overall poor individual job done.If anyone for the establishment is reading,  please note: Iced tea should be more than just brown-colored water."
The best Chicago-style pizza I've had yet.. this is where I bring my visitors from out of town!
"Was visiting Chicago for the first time and of course needed to try some deep dish pizza. We got a recommendation from a local friend to check out Pequod's and it was definitely a great choice! We came in for lunch and the staff was really friendly and the service was quick. The pizza was, well, life changing. I'll be returning next time I come to Chicago!"
A GREAT Pizza! The carmelized crust tastes sooo good!
Skip the chains and the pretenders.  This is the best neighborhood Chicago Pizza.
"I guess it's pile on with the praise (so don't let it go to your head you guys) but man is this place fantastic. The best way to describe it is the ""anti-Malnati's"" The pizza is just as good (maybe even better) but the atmosphere is much less ""corporate"" with a well worn interior, t-shirts of the restaurant's mascot hanging for sale behind the bar (I think it's a whale, Lord I hope it's a whale because if it's not, I am officially concerned) and a straight view into the kitchen. Lou would never stand for such frivolity!I had a sausage pizza and it was awesome. Thick crust, perfectly done, with a nice layer of burnt cheese around the edge. A great tomato sauce and thick gooey cheese. Well worth the wait.The lunch special of a personal pizza and either draft beer (Bud Light) or soda for $5 is insane. Seriously what is wrong with you people!?Then again, it was the perfect ploy as I wanted to try it so I used the lunch special as my entree into Pequod's. Now I'll be back since I've tasted the cheese, saucy goodness.Well played Pequod's, well played..."
I love pequods pizza... It's like Portillo's but in the pizza world! Just the best.  Love this place and had a birthday party here before upstairs.  Yeah.. it's awesome!
Contrary to what outsiders think of Chicagoans we rarely eat deep dish pizza but if we do its Pequods
Best pizza in the world. Their deep dish takes close to an hour to bake. Well worth the wait.
Don't tell the tourists about this place! Let them eat at Gino's East and Malnati's! Love it! Especially after a Blackhawks game!
Amazing deep dish pizza. If you're looking for authentic deep dish Chicago style pizza this is the place. After trying a few different pizzerias to find that authentic deep dish I have concluded this is the place. New favorite spot for pizzas when in town... Must try!
"Very good pizza, always on my short list.  It is a little different from the other popular places but I love that caramelized cheesy deliciousness.  Plus I can buy it by the slice which helps when everyone likes something different.  I first enjoyed this pizza and a cocktail over 15 years ago and it is still delicious every time."
The best pizza in Chicago. I take everyone that visits  here and no one has ever been disappointed. I get take out often and the staff is rude but the pizza is so good I don't care.
"Angela was our server and she was magical. I mean.. This pizza is superb but our service was awesome and it's because of Angela (upstairs, not to be confused with Angela downstairs). Much love for the good vibes"
"Best pizza in the city, hands down. The burnt cheese crust is unique and delicious. Go for the pepperoni with giardiniera."
"The deep dish was good and one of the places that serve the freshly made pizza right from the grill.The pizza was soft and well done. One of the few places that makes the best deep dish pizza.But the service is too slow. Other than that, the place was dim and loud."
Excellent deep dish as a first timer. Blackened crust is different but I enjoyed it. Packed place on a Sat evening but hey if you make a good pizza people are going to want it!
"There are a lot of great pizza places but I believe Pequod's Pizza stands above all others. Although the bottom of the pizza seemed little undercooked, its golden-brown crust was incredibly delicious. I can definitely eat Pequod's crust as a meal. It is true that if you want to have quote few number of toppings, it can get quite expensive. However, it is worth it. Go ahead and order a large pizza for you and your date, enjoy the best-pizza-in-Chicago, and take the leftovers home! Even the leftovers taste great (make sure to use an convection oven)."
"There is no other deep dish pizza in Chicago as far as I'm concerned. Sooooo good. I love that cheese you'll keep reading about in reviews, the only thing is, every great once in a while me and the boyfriend have a taste for thin crust. Not the biggest fans of their thin crust pie here....it's not nasty, just the thin crust pie I like is the real thin type with big air bubbles in the crust like say, Piece's thin crust.All in all though, there is NO OTHER, NO BETTER deep dish pizza in Chicago, hell in THE WORLD!!!!"
Best chicago style deep dish in city.  The crust is unbelievable with a carmelized cheese bubbling over.  Great  lunch special!
"Pequod's wasn't on my list to vist for my trip to Chicago, but my brother who visited pior highly recommended and commented that this is worth making trip and this is the best pizza he has had in his life. So, I had high expectations. After a 1 hr and 10 mins wait, we finally got our table. We ordered an appetizer combo while we wait an hour for our pizza to bake. The appetizer was very mediocre. After what seems like forever since it was past 9pm already, our pizza finally got to our table. We got a large pan pizza with mushroom, italian beef, and pepperoni topping. The portion was plenty for 4 people. Everyone was stuffed. The crust was delicious. Nothing like what I've eaten before. The first few bites were very good, but it got really salty after the first few bites. It was likely because the pepperoni that was piled on. There was at least 2 layers of pepperoni. If only there was less, maybe I would've gave it a 5 star. Service was very good. The waitress checked up on us very often and was a delight."
"Pequods is the bomb. Their deep dish is one of the best the city has to offer-the burnt cheesy crust makes it, and the tomato sauce---yummmm! Family loves pepperoni/sausage combo. Thin crust is also good if that's what you're in the mood for but the deep dish at Pequods is what's up. Haven't tried anything else so I can't review any other food items."
"I'm from NYC and I had my fair share of pizza. This is my first time having deep dish pizza. We added pepperoni and mushrooms as toppings, which made the pizza more delicious. The pizza is good, but I definitely prefer thin crust than the thick crust. I recommend trying this place out if you're ever going to Chicago."
Better than Giordanos. The crust is pretty heavenly but next time I'll get extra sauce and cheese. Best deep dish I've had in Chicago thus far.
"First off, either make a reservation or get here before 6. They fill up real fast. Secondly, GET THE PIZZA! Thirdly, make sure you try it with meatballs. Holy crap, were they great! Having been to Giordanos, UNOs, the best part about Pequods is that there is only one location."
"Now, I must admit I was rather drunk upon arriving here....at 4pm, however the pizza was great and helped soak up a lot of alcohol. The service was quick and the staff were nice. The pizza was damn right deep and tasted great. I'd recommend if you are in the neighbourhood, if not, get some bikes (sober) or a cab (which are cheap in Chicago) for a thick slice."
"The beef sandwich combo with sausage, cheese, peppers and garlic toast was awesome.  Deep dish was better than Giordanos and Lou Malnatis. Lou's butter crust is better but overall this place was top notch."
"Wow!  The pizza is awesome!  I have turned on many friends and family to this place.  The pizza is well done and buttery/carmelized which I like.  A must try for anyone visiting Chicago.  I have been to both Clybourn and The Loop location, both are fun!"
"Pequod's is amazing. Perfect crust, not too doughy like some others, probably my #2 favorite pizza place in Chicago. Worth a try!"
"Stop acting like a misguided tourist by going to those ""other"" pizza places. THIS IS CHICAGO DEEP DISH! But in all seriousness you will not regret it! The pizza is a perfect ratio of cheese, sauce, and that sweet sweet caramelized crust. The rest of the menu beyond the pizza is rather average, but let's be honest if you're ordering something other than pizza you're doing it wrong."
"Solid deep dish. Their caramelized crust is the best! Also, they have a really great lunch special (monday-friday) where you can get a personal pan pizza and a beer for $4.95. They are also open really late at night and have plenty of upstairs seating."
"Best deep dish in Chicago in my opinion. Definitely better than Giordano's, Lou's or Pizano's."
"Best pizza in town! Anyone visiting, its a must!! Can get a little annoyingly packed. But thats just a sign of a great product."
"amazing caramelized crust on their deep dish. Should be the new 'Chicago' staple. I now bring out of town guests here instead of the Lou's, because it's just better. it is."
"THE BEST deep dish in Chicago. Skip the chain restaurants and come here. Get there early though and you can wait up to 2.5-3 hours to eat (unlike the chain places, they don't let you preorder your pizza)."
I love Pequots so much!  Best Pizza in Chicago hands down.  The crust is so good and the ingredients are so fresh!
"Pequod's has been my favorite Chicago pizza for quite some time, but tonight's visit was exceptional thanks to our server. Halfway through our meal my mom and I actually both said how much we liked her - she was personable, kind, and cheerful which goes a long way. On top of that, she bought us our dinner for no reason other than to spread some smiles! I will ABSOLUTELY be paying this forward and hope I can brighten someone else's day the way she brightened ours. Thank you, Romi!"
Best deep dish I've had in Chicago. Better than Gino's and Malnatis. Immediate seating on a Sunday afternoon for 3 people.
deep dish peperoni is as good as it gets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The caramelized cheese crust is awesome but has high variance in delivery quality.  Sometimes crust can be soggy other times it is great.
Worth the wait! The pan style pizza is amazing. Takes about 30-45min to make but it comes out with the most delicious bubbly carmalized crust.  Great for take out or dine in.
"As an appetizer we ordered the fried zucchini.  It came with ranch sauce and the combination was delicious!!We also ordered the pan pizza with sausage, mushroom and onion.  The pieces of sausages on our pizza were huge!  While many yelpers raved of the caramelized crust, I was not a fan of it.  The crust looked more black and burnt than caramelized to me. No thanks.  The bottom of the crust was more bread like (fluffy) and not crispy than what I've had from other pizzerias.However, service was top notch. Everyone was very friendly. We were checked up upon multiple times by multiple people.  Since this pizzeria is a little out of the way for me, I don't think I will be visiting again for a while."
"Best deep dish in Chicago, and one of the Chicago spots I miss most since moving out west.  It takes forever, as good deep dish tends to, but Pequod's takes waiting to another level. Luckily there are some ways to get around this: a) arrive early, or go on a weeknight; or if there's a wait, put your name in and b) head to the co-owned bar up the street for drinks and appetizers or c) hang by the bar in Pequod's and grab a brew while you wait.  I've done both b) and c) and recommend b) because you can actually sit down, and the wait can stretch up to 2hrs. After you brave the gauntlet of waiting, being seated, and deciding what you want to order, the pizzas are hefty and delicious--two mediums will feed four hungry adults and there will still likely be leftovers. It's not a sports bar but there are some TVs which was great for watching the Cubbies in the NLDS one night I went. Love Pequod's!"
"Yaas, finally some outstanding deep dish!  I had the Pequod salad and the personal pan deep dish with sausage and pepperoni and both were amazing!!!  I live nowhere near this place but I'll drive the 35 min one way to eat it!  Definitely a must if your looking for good deep dish Chicago style pizza!"
"THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA EVER!!!My boyfriend and I  was on a mission to find the best pizza in Chicago! Our friends recommended trying Lou Malnati's so we went to Pequod's first thinking we would save the best for last. Well let me tell you PEQUOD's was the best we've ever had! We are from Los Angeles so we dont mind waiting in line to be seated. The wait was about 30mins, not too bad. We ordered the deep dish with Sausage, Pepperoni and Mushrooms.  It was the biggest sausages we've seen on a pizza! This place out beats all the places in Los Angeles and everywhere else! The sauce / cheese everything was sooo good and fresh!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE IF YOU'RE IN CHICAGO!!! TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!"
"Best deep dish pizza ever! Nothing compares, especially when you dine-in (rather than carry-out). I don't think they have very good apps or a salad, and the thin isn't very good either, but they still get 5 stars because the deep dish is incredible. They really should improve the quality of their other offerings"
"U gotta go!!!! Best pizza , how is this possible when there giordano and Gino east in town. Affordable and local place. Take an uber driver there. Ordered individual deep pan. Great to do when you don't want to share."
"Forget Lou, forget Giordano, go to Pequod.It is definitely the best deep dish pizza of Chicago."
"Pizza is great, as per usual. Be forewarned, you'll need to set aside a MINIMUM of two hours to eat here at any point after 5:30p. Even if they tell you that the pizza is a 40 minute bake time, plan on them suddenly adding 20-30 minutes to that."
"Great tasting pan or deep dish pizza, while we didn't have the thin crust, I'm sure it would be just as good.  Would certainly be back."
"I feel terrible for cheating on my beloved Gino's east.  But, alas it had to be done.Pequods for sure is by far the BEST DEEP DISH pizza in Chicago...well...ok its as good as Gino's East.  I love the spinach and garlic, it's amazing.Definitely has a decent crowd, went on a weeknight and it was great.Also has pretty cool lunch specials for anyone thats in the area that can stop by for lunch...Great Beer list as well.Dessert...meh..go somewhere else (they get it from a bakery anyway...the carrot cake...not the best just fyi)...and service is pretty awesome.will be back for sure!"
"Friendly staff, quick deep dish, and great atmosphere. A True Chicago pizzeria,"
So delicious! Their lunch special is every college student's dream.
"The first time I came here I made the mistake of not making a reservation. We ended up waiting upwards of two hours for a table. Since then, I've learned that they do take reservations! Amazing. Another tip-- even after you make a reservation you should call about an hour before you get there to start your pizza. The pizzas take a long time to cook, so this will get the za on your table soon after you arrive. The pizza itself is delicious. The sauce is the best! The crust and base are breadier than Lou Malnati's but not as bready as Giordano's."
"The caramelized cheese on the crust for the pan pizza is magical. This is one of the best pies in Chicago. Absolutely delicious. Pequod's delivers. And that is fantastic. However, the problem is that they take this magical pizza and put it in a styrofoam clamshell and then put that clamshell in a plastic bag, which they tie tightly at the top. By the time you get the delivery, it is a soggy mess inside a plastic bag wet with condensation. I've asked them to simply box the pizza, but they won't. I'd eat here every week if they could deliver me a pizza in a box rather than a steam bath. Don't get delivery. But DEFINITELY go there and get this pizza. It is incredibly delicious."
"If you're deciding on where to get pizza, THIS IS THE PLACE! Ive had everything from the thin crust pizza for an appetizer to party sized three appetizers and their famous pan pizza for dinner. Being a picky person I've never had a complaint. Although I'm out of their delivery area I still pick up all the time. The wait is worth it, after all it takes some time to bake such an amazing pizza, wouldn't expect anything less."
"If  Michelangelo (Ninja Turtles) could write a review about pizza this would be one of them. Where to begin? I have been going to Pequod's for the past 10 years.  I love two types of pizza Thin Crust and Pan.  This review is based on Pan pizza. Nowhere have I tried a better Pan pizza other than Pequod's. Their Thin crust pizza is not as great as their Pan,  I would say mediocre to any other Mom and Pops shop.  Moving forward with their Pan pizza you can expect a HIT OR A MISS. By this I mean they're not always consistent. I've been going to this place so often that I know when they get their ingredients right on cue. Sometimes, they add too much cheese, other times they overwhelm you with water down sauce. Even so, when they do get it right all I could say is COWABUNGA! The infused  burned cheese with the sweet crunch crust touching that flavorful tomato sauce that makes my friend Leonardo scream WICKED AWESOME! Moving forward, this place can get hectic. Every time I go I always have hours to spare so I don't mind the wait.  Having some beers while waiting is the norm. Appetizers are 7/10 nothing special, but great to kill some time. I rather stick to the pizza and beers. Staff are most of the time attentive. I see how they can become agitated by all the customers, but work with them and they'll work with you. Like I said if you come to this place don't expect to have that perfect pan pizza all the time. I heard from friends that their second location is better than the Chicago location. Can't say for sure. All I can say for this location is that  if they happen to get it right ""Bravo"" you have finally tried a bite of heaven my friend."
Fernald location is the only one I've been to. Fresh ingredients and crispy crust...I dream of this pizza.
"LOVE this place!! Easily one of my favorite pizza joints in Chicago. I live and die by Lou Malnati's, but this is a solid alternative if I don't feel like waiting 2 hours to dine in. Probably some of the best Chicago style pizza I've ever had; their toppings are high-quality, and the crust isn't too dense or bogged down with too much sauce/toppings. I LOVE their sausage pizza, and I always order it with the giardiniera, which tastes awesome! Laid back dining in environment, and friendly staff. Good place to catch a Hawks game over a good pizza and some beers. Highly recommend it!!"
"Spinach, tomato, and garlic on a pan pizza is the best!Yes, I said it.  No meat, just a good veg deep dish - notice the lack of onions?  the lack of olives or any such unnecessary ""ingredients""?  Pequod's makes an amazing deep dish, and if you want to get a good pie without feeling like you overdid it, go veg.  Drink a beer, wine, or soda and be happy.  I can honestly say, I've never been disappointed with the food here."
"If there was only a way to give this 10 stars I would.  While I get my fair share of eye rolling from other Chicago-style pizza lovers, THIS is my favorite deep dish in town.  The sauce...  The crust...I probably eat here once a month and would go more if my wallet and waistline would allow it.  Tuesdays are my favorite night to go, because you can grab a pie (I'd suggest calling ahead and having them start it if you're in a rush--it is deep dish after all) then go see a 1/2 price movie at the Regal on Webster right across the street.  They also have a very respectable craft beer selection.  I wish they had more specials, but lets be serious, I'm definitely going to come here anyway."
"My friends and I ordered two medium pan pizzas for the 5 of us (3 guys and two girls) and it was the perfect portion - the server gave a great recommendation.Overall, the pizza was very good but the ""caramelized crust"" I've heard raved about translates to ""burnt cheese"". Now, call me crazy but I liked burnt cheese (and so did others with me) so we didn't mind so much, but others may. Good amount of cheese + sauce + toppings. I took away a star mostly because it seems as though they are trying to copy Lou Malnati's butter crust, but it's not quite there that the flavor falls flat. Chicago style pizza is all about the crust and if you mess that up, it's kind of a fail. I would probably order Lou's over this, but wouldn't hate going back either."
IfYou wantPizza Cake(i.e. deep dish)Then caramelized crust coma it is. Yum.
"The pizza is really good, and they are a Hawks bar, so there is Blackhawks swag everywhere which is nice. Is it worth waiting outside in line for? No, probably not. But if you happen to drive by and there's no line, you should totally check this place out."
Great Pizza and Cool Environment. Great place to catch up with friends and enjoy some really good food and cold beer!
Since I was a kid this is my fav pizza place in the city over Lous for sure! Always willing to accommodate us and so great to their guests!
"I know, this is one of those hyped up Chicago pizza joints and you probably have your own secret neighborhood spot that's waaaayyyy better... Am I right?  Get over it.  Sure this is somewhat touristy, but you know what, it's good. If you're willing to put up with a long wait to get in and then an equally long wait for them to cook the pizza, then this isn't a bad option for you.  Great sauce, awesome caramelized cheese crust, big portions, but I never walk away feeling overly full.  The sausage is delicious. It's also not that greasy which is a bonus for me. Unfortunately the service last time was a little hit or miss. We showed up with a group of 5 around 4:30 and they clearly didn't know how to handle it. Two tables pushed together?  Cram us in a big booth?  They couldn't figure it out. They decided to make us wait 10 minutes until they decided on a table. It was a bit ridiculous considering the place wasn't even that crowded yet. All that aside this is a good pizza spot and I'll be back."
"Good pizza, certainly earns four stars!!!"
Pequod's makes a delicious pan pizza! A 'must visit' for the Za Connoisseur.  Cheers Pequod's!
"We ordered Pequod's for delivery after a recommendation from a friend. I'm not usually a review person, but I was so impressed I had to write one for this place! I'm reeeeeaaallly picky about my pizza--I hate thin crust and Chicago-style deep dish usually makes me sick. Pequod's pan pizza was a perfect medium. We ordered a plain ol' pepperoni for our first try, and it was literally what you think of when you think of Pizza, all cheesy, hot, and delicious. Plus, they initially told us an hour and 45 minutes for delivery (nbd, Saturday night at a popular place) and they came after just over an hour with hot, fresh pizza."
"The pizza is AWESOME.  We absolutely love it.  The salads are really good, too.  We usually have pretty good service but it's never spectacular.  We overlook that as their schtick and well worth it for Pequod's delicious pizza creations.I'd give the place 5 stars but they really need to clean up their act....literally.  I noticed that the bathrooms were incredibly dirty but didn't say anything about it until my partner mentioned on the way home how dirty the men's room was and that the garbage cans in the hallway to the kitchen were absolutely over-flowing.  It's a moderately busy late lunch hour.  Get one of the folks standing around to take out the freakin' trash cans!  Gross.I was also really put off when the guy up front told the hostess to seat us at ""Table 12.""  Table 12 is the worst table in the entire place -- it 1/2 blocks the hallway to the super hot and humid kitchen by the phone order room and bathrooms with no view of the TVs so you can really focus on the dirty bathrooms and garbage cans outside of the kitchen.  We immediately asked to be seated in one of the 6-7 open tables at the front of the house rather than the dreaded Table 12.  The crappiest tables should be used only when absolutely necessary.  If a waitress in one section is getting slammed with too many customers, they should just reconfigure the table assignments rather than have people suffer at a horrible table.  Oh, and the waitress forgot part of our order.  And, yet, we give it high marks and will still go back for the pizza....although probably not as often....and, we may do pick up or delivery instead."
"That crust is the stuff of legends, and for good reason.  And delivery until 2AM doesn't hurt either.**except for my waistline, but it's so worth it"
"On a Bucket List tour of Chicago, so I got to try Pequod's finally! Got delivery, was totally worth it. Reminds me of what pizza hut could be if they didn't SUCK and what Noble Romans in Northern Indiana was in my childhood....Had sausage on my half. Just fantastic. Just enough cheese, maybe a TINY bit more sauce would have been good, but it wasn't dry at all like other reviewers experienced. The plain cheese was also fantastic, but the crispy, blackened cheese on the edges of the crust made it even BETTER!I am going to be so sad when I move to Nashville and there is NO GOOD PIZZA :'''("
"Yes the pizza was unique and different than what I am used to having here in Chicago but I have to say that Lou's is still my favorite.The sausage had really good flavor and I enjoyed my meal, minus one star for the abrupt and kinda rude hostess ;0("
"Hands down, my favorite deep dish in the city. Their wait time can be a bit annoying, but that caramelized crust is worth the wait! I always try to take out-of-town guests here because it just epitomizes Chicago."
"I've been here a few times whenever I'm out in Chicago and it's hands down one of the best pan pizzas you can get in Chicago.  Special caramelized cheese crust.  The sausage is the bomb-diggity.  There's a pretty good lunch special with a Bud Lite and personal pan pizza for like 7 or 8 bucks.  But if you're here with 2 people, you may as well just get a medium pizza.Tons of TVs.  Great divey, yet family-friendly atmosphere.  Daisy Cutter on draft.  Affordable.  What more can you want?"
"What a hidden gem! This is in the running for best deep dish in the city. You can't beat their lunch special in the city: $4.95 for personal pizza +1 topping and a drink (including Bud Light). Staff is cool-- extremely efficient, but not pushy. I would recommend this place to everyone. P.S. Has upstairs seating that is available for private parties. enjoy!"
"Hands down the best pizza in Chicago! The cost is out of this world, definitely worth the long wait!"
"Amazing deep dish pizza here.  The place was not packed when we got there around 5, but by the time we left, there was enough of a queue.  It was worth the 45 minute wait for the pizza.  It is the only deep dish I had while in Chicago - and it was the only one I needed.  Two of us shared a medium and it was more than enough... took home some leftovers, and enjoyed the pizza cold later!Would definitely come again!"
"Look, we all know deep dish comes in many forms here in Chicago, and everyone has their favorite. This just happens to be mine. I love the bread/crust-forward approach, since I feel some other pies around the city are drowning in too much sauce, without good bread to back it up. The caramelization on this beast is also bomb. Doesn't get any better. And there are just enough toppings to give good flavors while still letting the bread shine. I also like the fact that it retains its unique feel, being just a humble neighborhood bar rather than one of the many chains. In the end, this joint might not become your favorite, but that's just fine with me. Helps keep the always ridiculous wait times in check."
"I love this place. Now that Door Dash will deliver it to my house ( I moved out of their normal delivery zone), I eat it 2-3 times a month. Mmmmmmmm. Caramelized cheese."
Amazing food!! We got the garlic bread and two small pan pizzas - one meat and one veggie. The sausage was to die for!! Rebecca served us and was really funny and helpful. She gave us great recommendations for our stay. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town :)
"I've been to Pequod's in Morton Grove,  the individual stuffed pizza is the best!buttery crust.  The individual size is just enough for one person.  The wait service is good.  And i love the old-fashioned divvy bar.  Good beer selection, sometimes you have to wait, but worth it."
Largely considered the best deep dish in Chicago and they deliver on that thought. If you are ordering delivery give yourself plenty of time. Delivery times are around 90 minutes no matter when you order.
"I am more of a thin slice pizza lover but when you are in Chicago you need eat the deep dish, and damn this was deep and delicious. I ordered a pepperoni and olive personal pizza and it blew me away. What got me was the crust which was very flavorful. Also had a decent amount of sauce on it, which was also very good.I live in Seattle and we have a Chicago Style Pizza place here. I will have to check it out and see how it compares but I do know I will have to come back when I am in Chicago again.Zipzap Zubidy Bop!"
"Met there with a large group of relatives for the very first time a few weeks back. (Reservation a must for a large group!) It was a little tight on space but yet still comfortable. The staff was very friendly and super accommodating. Our server was great- very on top of things and made some good recommendations. On to the pizza: delicious! My family loves a good deep dish and this did not disappoint. It's more in between a pan and deep dish. The sauce was very good, the toppings very fresh and the dough had good density. And I personally loved the burnt cheese crust, yum! I didn't try the thin crust but it looked pretty good too.We will def come back when we're in the area."
"A marvelous member of the Deep Dish family - Pequod's makes a very fresh, rich pizza with the most amazing toasted-black-cheese crust. Love it every single time!"
"Pequod's ranks up there with Lou Malnatis or Gullivers Pizza when it comes to deep-dish pizza in Chicago.  They've got a thicker, denser, but still light and airy base crust to the pizza compared to the other deep-dish pizza places, but its easy to develop a craving for that unique texture.I've yet to venture outside my usual pepperoni-topped pizza, which comes with a few of the pieces charred to a delicious black.  They also cook the pizza long enough to crisp (""burn"") some of the cheese on the edges of the crust.  I find it a delicious, salty, chewy addition to the texture of the pizza."
"They now deliver all the way out to me in Logan Square!  Took awhile to get here, but it was worth it."
Very delicious! Call ahead to be placed on the top of the waitlist when you arrive. Takes a while for the food to come out but won't be disappointed! Very good!
Want some Chicago style Pizza?  I'll save you some time.  Pequod's beats Giordano's beats Lou Malnati's beats Pizzeria Uno beats Gino's East
"Best pizza in Chicago. If you don't like it at first, keep coming back.  Their delivery area is SO LARGE and it takes 90 mins usually, but no pizza is better."
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, hands down!  If you want FLAVOR, with great crust, NOT over loaded with cheese, check this place out.  The sauce is awesome not sweet, has a tang...full of flavor; the crust is sturdy and crisp on the bottom, and a soft pillow on top; not too much cheese and the cheese creeps up the the edge and caramelizes -- wow is this fantastic!  Top it with sausage and pepperoni -- yum!"
"I order from here often once or twice a week it's either big or a small order and Im always indecisive depending on what I'm ordering because I always get a big order for my office but I call during the day and I must say I'm absolutely always satisfied and impressed with the phone girl named (Natalie) she is so efficient and fast and knows what I want and talks to fast it's amazing (sometimes I could be a pain asking a lot of questions to help me figure out how much pizza I need) I usually never leave reviews but I order from here often and I wanted to show some love so she doesn't get unnoticed she's doing a great job her customer service is awesome, as far as pizza it's a amazing I recommend the deep dish over the thin crust I am generally not a fan of deep dish, but this pizza is a MUST! I love pequods"
Best Pizza in the Chicagoland area hands down!! Always saw my friends on Facebook post pictures and statuses about how this was the best place in Chicago to get pizza. Well they were right!!Went to this place on a Saturday. And it was packed!! The restaurant itself has a bar look to it. Definitely recommend ordering pick-up or delivery unless you don't mind waiting for 30-50 minutes to be seated and then having to probably wait for your pizza. Overall the pizza hit the spot! I definitely will come back and order from this place for future pizza cravings. Forget that weak stuff like Papa Johns.
"I have criss-crossed this great nation, sampling the local varieties. I lived for a year in Italy. I eat pizza a lot. This is my favorite pizza.This is not ""Chicago-style Pizza"", though it is Pizza from Chicago.This is the Cadillac of Pizzas. It takes a super long time to cook and the lines at Pequod's are always horrendous, so it is not the pizza that I eat most often. But it is the pizza that I dream about most often. (side note, italian pizza is really great, and may be the ""original"" or whatever, but the spirit of America is progress, and Pequod's is progress)"
"There's simply no other choice where pizza is concerned. I'm a devoted crust-first kind of girl, but this caramelized crust is SERIOUS, enough to make me reconsider my stance. My go-to is sausage and spinach, a truly glorious combination. One or two pieces will fill you up, which is just fine because it reheats perfectly in an oven. Service is satisfactory, but nothing stellar, and I also think that beers are overpriced. This is a pizza joint all the way, and nothing else compares."
"I like big crusts and I cannot lie.Alright, I'm going to stop there and not try to make this into a thing.  But really, I could sing praises of Pequod's big crusts and their carmelized perfection.My husband, who is originally from Chicago,  has Lou Malnati's delivered from Chicago to Denver on his birthday, but one visit to Pequod's was enough to make him completely disregard his loyalties.  So, if you're like me and only visiting Chicago, you can get the legit deep dish experience at this pizzeria.  We had walked approximately a bajillion miles while we were out exploring the neighborhoods on foot, so we arrived hungry.  We waited about 30 minutes fo rour pizza to arrive and when it did one slice of our sausage and olive pie was enough to fill me up.  They have a decent selection of beers, as well, so you can arrive thirsty, too."
"Everything said already - ditto! I will take it a step further; I live in New York. I've tried all the New York favs, i.e. Grimaldi's and crew. Honestly, Pequod's is officially, hands down, the best pizza in the USA! That's right, Pequod's Chicago Deep Dish beats New York pizza hands down, from a real New Yorker; and I've got several friends of mine that agrees. The worst part of Pequod's is that I can't get it delivered to me in NYCIf it's your first visit, the perfect order at Pequod's is small pan pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and extra cheese. ***druel"
"The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the servers looked like they didn't want to be there.The food is so great...!!!. We got the Pequads salad and it was delcious.The pan pizza is buttery and delicious. We heated it up the next day and it was better than the first day! I'm a Lou's girl normally, but Pequads put up a good fight and it's 4 minutes away from my house. Boom."
Pequods!!!! OMG! Their crust is the most amazing thing in life! Solid deep dish pizza! Their delivery time is pretty quick and the pizza itself is damn awesome! Can't wait to order from here again! Absolutely love this place!!!!
"The quintessential Chicago deep dish.  Why is this place not the poster child for Chicago pizza?  Everything on the menu is amazing.  Ambience is energetic, yet intimate.  I used to live within walking distance of this place, and miss living closer."
"Definitely one of my favorite deep dish places in Chicago. Is it the best? I don't know, I wouldn't say that. But the crust is probably one of my favorites of all time. A delicate airy caramelized crust. Ughhhhhh so good, need it in my life now. If only the wait wasn't two hours every time I've gone. I myself would like it if they had some more toppings but hey, I get it. They focus on the crust and keep it simple. You do you gurl. Just do something about that wait time. It kills me everytime."
"It gets no better than this!  The best deep dish pizza in Chicago, hands down.  It is unassuming on the outside but you will typically see a line to get in.  They also have great lunch specials.  Highly recommend!!"
"Went here during the Blackhawks playoffs with my family who was in town and the pizza was to die for. The cheese crust did not disappoint and I see why it was voted the best in Chicago.  The best part of the experience was the waitstaff who, without us even asking, told us we were welcome to watch the rest of the game there, even when people were packing into the bar."
"Sometimes this place has wait times of 2 hours, because it's so good. Your best bet is pickup, which takes about 45 minutes, or even delivery, which can take up to 90 minutes. Either way, you'll be getting some of the best pizza anywhere. Chicago people joke that the best pizza in the city is always ""my neighborhood.""  Peqoud's is a great neighbor to have."
"Best deep dish in Chicago. Recommend the sausage & jalapeño. Thick deep dish with burnt cheese crust. Nothing compares to a Pequods pie, unlike any other pizza I've ever tried. Take out frequently from here. However, if you prefer to dine in it's a hip & swanky atmosphere. Great selections of brews."
"Mmmmm best deep dish pizza in Chicago!  I love Pequod's, they have some awesome pizza.  They bake the pizza in cast iron pizza pans which gives the crust the crispy texture I love and the flavor is great as well.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings are always spot on too.  All together you have one tasty pizza!Once you step in, it doesn't look like a very big place, but they have a 2nd floor which is quite large.  The atmosphere is very lively since it's always busy, they have tv's throughout the place, and though small, a decent beer list.  This is a pizza place though so I can't complain.Yes, I've had Lou Malnati's and they do have great pizza too, but I prefer Pequod's, especially if I'm dining in.  Lou's is a boring place to eat unless you're looking for a nice quite dinner in what looks like your grandma's living room.You need to eat at Pequod's if you haven't done so already."
First let me say that the service was excellent both the waitress and server went out of the way to explain to us what made their pizza different to the rest and gave us great recommendations. We started with mozzarella sticks (very yummy) then we had pepperoni pizza which was different to a chicago deep dish because this was more crush but it was good. For dessert the lovely waitress recommend the brownie and we also ordered a peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie and both were delicious and served warm.
"What a special & different kind of deep-dish - caramelized with a slight burnt taste, nothing like it. VERY delish!"
"On the plane coming from Orange County, CA to Chicago a man recommended this place to me. My friend I was staying with happened to live a block away so we checked it out. I'm so glad we did. Pequods pizza out of all the pizza places I tried while I was in Chicago was the best hands down. What made it so fucking good was that there pepperoni had a nice quality feel to it and sauce was incredible. But the real kick in the teeth was the caramelization at the end of the piece of pizza. That was like the desert. I cant even begin to explain how good that was. It was so good that we went 2 days in a row to Pequods. I also learned that you can ask for extra caramelization so when I come back to Chi town you can find me in Pequads drinking a ice cold pale ale. CHEERS"
"Walking through the Lincoln Park neighborhood I knew I had to try Peqoud's.  The accolades from this establishment stem from the original owner and his understanding of what makes a good deep dish pizza.  I've even seen the food being sampled on TV as I was channel surfing.  Dropped in and tried a Large deep dish pizza, half pepperoni, half sausage, extra cheese, extra sauce, and garlic.  Not surprisingly the caramelized cheese crust immediately set this pizza apart from all others.  I've never had so much cheese crust on one pizza before, which I highly appreciated, as it's my favorite part of a good pizza.  It's nice to have a pizza place where you don't have to hope there will be sufficient caramelized cheese on the crust due to chance, I will definitely be returning."
"What a great Chicago experience! Fun environment with plenty of opportunity to watch sports and have a cold beer. The service was swift and friendly. Now the deep dish pizza... Well crafted, oozing with cheese, sausage, garlic, and olives. Nothing short of Delicious. I really felt like I was eating Chicago. Highly recommended."
I have been a fan of this place for over 10 years!  The crispy garlicky crust is the absolute best.  Only warning..you WILL have to wait to get a table most nights AND then you will have to wait for your pizza to be made.  So sit down and order right away to get the pizza's in the oven.  Well worth the wait in my opinion however.
"Stop #4 on my ""Eating my way through Chicago/St. Louis and possibly doing other things on this trip Summer Tour 2011"" found me finally at some deep dish pizza.  Another recommendation from my friend.  It is all about the crust at Pequod's.  Yum freakin' yum.Another place you will wait in line for.  The friend that I was staying with hadn't heard of Pequod's.  I was hoping we were in for a treat.  The beauty of Pequod's is that they will take your pizza order while you wait to be seated.  Deep dish usually takes a while to cook, so ordering it while you have yet to sit is a really nice thing for them to do.Once seated, we started out with the Appetizer Combo which was a bunch of fried things like mozzarella sticks, zucchini, poppers and mushrooms.  It was ok.  Fried is fried.  You can't really do a terrible job at frying things.  I was ready for the pizza.We had the pan pizza with onions and pepperoni.  The pizza is baked in cast iron pans blackened by decades of seasoning and the overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.  If that doesn't sound good to you, what does?  This is not a pizza for the faint of heart.  Deep dish is heavy and we didn't see anyone leaving the restaurant without a to go bag.  We ended up taking a good portion home and I had a slice 2 days later.  Still tasted really good.There are a ton of pizza shops in Chicago.  Everyone has a favorite.  If I lived here I can see Pequod's being a favorite for years and years."
"Love this place and keep coming back. Consistant everytime, only issue is everyone knows how good the pizza is here. Sometimes the wait time is long, but we'll worth it."
"Have always been a fan of their thin crust, and they may possibly have the best pepperoni In Chicago. Went in recently there to dine in and try theirDeep Dish. I'd give their deep dish a nod above most but still partial to Lou's. Fresh toppings were solid. The garden salad was great as well."
This place has some good cheesy bread (and pizza too). Of course you come here for the pizza but it's always nice to chomp on a tizer' while you wait the 30min for your fresh pie to finish
I'm not a deep dish connoisseur. Living on the West Coast my entire life probably precludes me from making a judgment on deep dish pizza. But this establishment is a lot of fun. And the pizza is very tasty.
"This place has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I tell everyone to go try this place and they all get hooked. Don't let the look of the crust fool you. It's one of the best parts of the pizza. Nice 2 level place and good service. Parking can be a little bit of an issue, but well worth it. Blackhawks bar as well with lots of craft beers, etc."
"Ordered delivery from this place after a recommendation from a friend. My friend and I were too tired to go eat at the place and we were close enough for delivery! yay! :) the pizza was really good. It is a deep dish pizza so order a smaller pizza. We ordered a medium, but in hindsight a small would have been sufficient. The wait for delivery was an hour and 20 minutes but we figured it would be long since it's such a popular place and it was during the weekend. Would definitely order from here again."
- The pizza is outstanding.- $5 for a personal pan pizza /and/ a drink at lunchtime?  How can you top that?
The best deep dish pizza within city limits. ((Drops mic))Otherwise... it gets crowded. Its loud. Get a reservation and order ahead.
"Finally I've tried the pizza that my friends have been raving about!  I've had a lot of deep dish in the last few weeks, trying to find the best in town for my English boyfriend.  Together we've had Uno's, Lou Malnati's, and Gino's East - of course I've tried Giordano's too.  Some better than others, but I don't think he ever got what the fuss was about with Chicago style deep dish.  Too bad he left before I came here!On a warm, sunny Saturday, the place was pretty busy with a 30 minute wait around 6:45 pm.  You'd do well to order while you wait since the pizzas can take 45 minutes or more to make.  We waited outside on the bench facing Clybourn, until our buzzer finally went off and we went to our booth - the place is bigger than it looks, with two floors and several rooms.  The atmosphere was a lot like a neighborhood bar - lively and fun, with TVs playing the game and lots of people drinking and laughing.We started with a pitcher of Blue Moon, the first of two, and after about 45 minutes in the oven our spinach-and-sausage pizza came to the table.  The server cut the first slices, and the hot cheese stretched high - so appetizing!  Unlike a lot of deep dish, this pizza doesn't taste greasy or heavy.  Sure it's a lot of food, but it tastes almost fresh.  The spinach was abundant, the sausage had to be homemade - it was full of flavor and spices.  The crust stayed crispy the whole time, never getting weighed down by sauce and toppings.  My friend pointed out that I'd basically inhaled my first slice - I was hungry, but it was also so delicious I didn't want to take a break!  A large pizza filled three of us (with one piece left over).  Any appetizers would've just filled us up for no good reason so I'm glad we just stuck to pizza.It's not overpriced, the atmosphere is fun, the pizza is great, and it's worth a little wait outside.  I still have love for Lou's and Gino's East, but this is definitely the place to go for Chicago deep dish."
Best Chicago deep dish. Need I say more?
"Best pizza in Chicago, hands down.  I wish they would expand or move since the wait time is usually really long and sometimes even pickup takes hours since they are backed up.  There's a gym across the street that you can work out at while you wait... you'll need it since you will want everything on the menu.  Twice."
Pequod's is my current favorite Chicago style deep dish joint. The crust is hearty and stays crisp and the caramelized edges are great. The sauce is well seasoned the cheese/sauce/ingredients/crust ratio is just right.I recently took another yelper's suggestion to try sausage and giardiniera and now I'm hooked.
"Slightly different spin on Chicago Deep Dish. More of a well done pan pizza. Overall in my top 3 deep dishes I've eaten. Love the burnt cheese around the edges. Great beer selection and prices. Get there early, it gets crowded quickly!"
"Best deep dish in chicago , better than Lou malnati's.Try going during off times (Saturday night is usually a 2 hour wait) or order for pick up."
"Recently appointed as my favorite pizza place in Chicago.Love both their deep dish and pan pizzas and their drink selection is perfect for the type of food being served.I love going here during basketball season to catch a game, eat some delicious food and great drinks. Although it can be really crowded we never feel rushed and the service is great."
"I'm a New York pizza kinda guy, but when it comes to pan pizza, only Pequod's can make you desire a pan pizza more than a New York style pizza. Let's start with the marinara sauce: A little sour, garlicky and spicy. Unlike other pizzas, where the marinara it's just there almost for decor, in pequod's the marinara elevates the flavor to new heights!The borders of the crust are composed of burnt cheese which makes it crispy and chewy at the same time. The only downside to this place is that it gets packed! Beware people! Don't go there hungry. And if you crave for it during the weekends, plan it because sometimes it takes them more than 1hr for pick up orders and more than 1.5 hrs for a table."
Literally the best deep dish on earth. Make sure you make reservation! Or else you'll be in line for 2 hours!!!
"First a point of clarification.  Chicago is the pizza capitol of the world.  To rebuttals, especially from New York, I chuckle condescendingly. Pequod's serves Chicago's best pan pizza."
"The deep dish pizzas are really good, but they're super filling. My friend and I couldn't finish the smallest one. I'm not usually a fan of sausage on my pizza, but it was good here.Side note: The regular--- thin crust one... don't even bother."
"Called ahead to put my name on the list (no reservations but priority seating instead), and when we got there around 7pm, we were seated within five minutes. Really impressed by the service!  Our waitress was really sweet and took our beer & salad orders. Then another waitress came by within a few minutes to take our pizza orders. The restaurant was mostly full, so it was nice that they were working together to take orders. Decent selection of beers with most of the craft beers being local.  Goose Island, Fat Tire, Bell's... can't really go wrong there.  The house salad is not your typical iceberg lettuce with a few carrot shavings, but a large bowl of leafy greens plus some fixin's.  Great way to start the meal. Now, the thing everyone actually cares about. Pizza! I'm not a deep dish expert, but this is gooooood. Crunchy exterior (I hear they melt cheese on the crust) and soft on the inside. I ordered a personal pan with pepperoncini and mushrooms. It's a 7-inch pan that is supposed to be for one person. I ate two slices and had to call it quits, but my friends both crushed theirs, so maybe I'm just a lightweight. If you're not super hungry, or don't want to leave feeling stuffed, the personal pan is enough for two!"
"Ordered deep dish spinach for delivery.  When I opened the box, it looked...questionable.  Then I had my first bite and it is probably the best deep dish I've ever had.  Deeeeeeeeeeeelicious!Definitely not overrated.  GREAT PIZZA!"
Love the pizza. Carmelized Crust.... DUH. Two slices leave me comatosed.Love the choice of beer.I like to hit pequods Monday- Weds.Less of a crowd and wait.PS you can call in and have it start before you get there.The only issue I had was I didn't feel like my server was very attentive. She was dancing and talking about music videos with the hostess.I'm NEEDY sometimes!
"Both the wait to be seated and the wait for the pizza are long, yet their deep dish pizza was exceptionally good.  Our order seemed to have been skipped in the kitchen so our waiter spoke to the manager and she gave us half off our pizzas. Great alternative to the popular chain deep dish restaurants you see in Chicago."
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago! The cheese crust makes the difference! The ambiance is more like a pub! Definitely recommend either if you're visiting Chicago or are here for good
went with a friend cause he said the pizza was amazing. I thought he might be exaggerating cause he doesn't eat pizza as much as I do but it definitely was as good as he claimed. and it was a late Sunday night and they were still open while many other places in the area were already closed. definitely coming here more often.
"Very , very good. Carmelized crust makes all the difference. Service was good, had a bigger group and she still did all the proactive service you would think."
"If you happen to ever find yourself in an argument over what place has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, just say Pequod's. You will win the argument.(Good beer selection + across the street from movie theater = perfect date night)"
"When I think of deep dish, my first reaction was Lou Malanati's. Ever since I lived for a year off of Ashland and Fullerton, Pequods has been the picture I see when I hear deep dish. My first experience quite interesting with this place because this is one of the first deep dish pizzas I've ever had. The carmelized crust is something short special but gives this nice crispy finish to the meaty part of the pizza. I dislike the fact that it's a Blackhawks only bar/restaurant but that's how it is in Chicago. They don't give a shit about what type of bar the customer wants. Lol"
"This pizza is big time...yea...you've gotta go try this one if you haven't already.  And then you'll understand.  I'd put this pizza and crust up against any of the so called BIGGIES!  On the 2200 block of Clybourn in the Lincoln Park area, just go...just go!  You won't be disappointed!!!"
"This pizza just oozes and oozes cheese, which is great!  Even better is the burnt, crispy cheese bits around the edges of the crust.  Speaking of the crust - it was buttery, thick without being too thick, delicious!I was able to get  a piece of every ingredient (ground beef, mushrooms & spinach).  I was stuffed after 2 slices (without eating the side crust).Simply yummy."
Good pizza but wouldn't say it's better than the other pizza places in town....
"Coming from a girl who isn't  big pizza eater (or eater of any other carbs for that matter), the pizza here was surprisingly AMAZING. I was afraid to be disappointed in this ""DEEP DISH"" pizza that Chicago is known for (much due to my own personal preferences) but I was blown away at how delicious and texturally fabulous this DEEP dish pizza was. The crust is caramelized, so when you cut into it, you can feel the crispy crust breaking underneath your knife. The crust is crispy and topped with fresh cheeses, meats and veggies. The pizza must be eaten with a knife and fork BTW. The toppings (they recommend no more than 7 so that the pizza cooks thoroughly) are fresh and are lightly tossed on the deep dish pizza so that it is light and airy. Only reason why I avoid pizza is because the dough is dense and I feel overly stuffed after a single slice. The pizza here doesn't leave me feeling that way and I'm full after two slices sans caloric guilt.The place is open late and me being a spontaneous procrastinator entered with only 15 minutes left on the clock. We ordered a pizza and it was on our table in 10 mins. Large size pizza ($35 with tax and tip) split amongst 5 people and we (and our taste buds) were all satisfied. This is my first taste of deep dish pizza in Chi Town and I am absolutely blown away as to how delicious this was. I am very glad it was my first meal in the windy city. I can't wait to come back for more Pequods!!!"
This pizza is fabulous.  I love the thin crust and staff.  They are super friendly and are always helpful and observant.  I'm not quite ecstatic for the deep dish pizza but you have to try the thin for sure. I like that they have a room upstairs when it gets packed on the weekends.  These is extra points on my end.
MY wife's favorite pizza in the City (my second favorite). Love the carmelization on their pan pizza crust.
"They delivered excellent pizza to Emporium Arcade Bar where my friends and I were hanging out, well in advance of the time they stated would be the delivery time. We got one large sausage deep dish and one small mushroom pizza deep dish, and I actually wish we had done the reverse because the mushroom was amazing. Like other people are saying, I appreciated the crust.I've never visited the actual location, so I can't speak to that aspect of the Pequod's experience."
"My favorite deep dish in Chicago yet! Pequod's signature crust has crispy cheese spilling over onto the pan, and it's delicious. Lots of topping choices as well. I would recommend getting a small pizza, or multiple small pizzas if you have more people, because the crust is the best part. Salads are also good, and a nice way to spend your time while waiting for the pizza (they're huge).It's more or less a sports bar, but with a very warm, casual atmosphere (and great food, of course). Great service, though of course the deep dish takes a while. There's usually a wait to get in, so plan ahead. You can order your deep dish while you wait if there are no tables, which is definitely a good option--less time waiting for your food once you get a spot.Additional note: I bought a tshirt here and I love it!"
"Great pizza! There is usually a wait, but totally worth it - place an order ahead. Good brews on tap, good ambiance - fun, homey and inviting. Extremely flavorful pizza, great atmosphere and great drinks and very filling. Order the sausage & pep with green bell pepper and onions and you will not be disappointed. Yes a small is sufficient for 2 people, though I wish I could eat more in one sitting. Highly recommend!"
"Excellent deep dish with caramelized crust.  I usually visit the Morton Grove location, but gave this a shot over the weekend when in Lincoln Park.   It is a lot of food for your money and the leftovers held up well for lunch the next day.   Toppings were really good - we had a bunch of different meats (sausage, pepperoni and bacon)."
"You can never beat Pequod's with the caramelized cheese crust, the rich and flavorful sauce and that thick layer of rich and creamy cheese in the center, on the bottom that crispy crust that holds it all together. You can't for get the perfectly seasoned sausage. Perfect Chicago style pizza"
Quite a long waiting time but well worth it when we got inside. 4 of us shared 2 small pizzas and some jalapeño poppers and just that was enough to fill us up and still send ourselves home with left overs. The food was delicious and our server was so friendly and accommodating
"GO HERE NOW!! This was the BEST deep dish EVER! Casual bar vibe with a great selection of local beers on tap. We had such a nice server with blonde hair, I forgot her name. The pizza tho is incredible....heaven on earth. DON""T come to Chicago and NOT eat here - it's a MUST!! Get the sausage!"
This place was on our pizza tour. It was delish. I'd go back every time I'm in chicago
"Pequods!  Say that to anyone and you'll put a smile on their face. The pizza is not the best deep dish in Chicago, but it is up there. And when you consider the atmosphere and the location, it is a winner.  I love the drinking bird which is right next door. They have amazing cocktails. So back to pequods.. the lunch special can't be beat. I think it is $6 for a personal deep dish and a beer. Ask yourself why you don't go there every day for lunch. Oh yeah. It takes 45 min for the pizza and you have things to do. Anyways. It is a fun place to go, especially with a group or folks from out of town."
"Best deep-dish in Chicago - hands down.  Good beer selection, also."
Truly delicious pizza!  I've tried pizzas from coast to coast and this is truly the best I've had.  Perfect crust and just the right amount of all the ingredients.  Spot on flavor
Best deep dish pizza I've ever tried. This was my first experience with Chicago deep dish ... Damn good!  Was a long wait but well worth it.
"I didn't want to go to the other Place so i tried this one. And i will say to my amazement it was great. Not even my Chicago Friends mentioned this place to me, maybe because it in a different part of town not close to Michigan ave.  This place wasnt crowded at all at the time I went for lunch."
Man that burned cheese is good.I gotta get back in there!
"On my recent trip to Chicago, I asked a few locals where the best pizza was, and the unanimous answer was Pequods.  I was raised in Chicago but haven't been back in years.  Came on a Sunday night and ordered a sausage deep dish on one 1/2 of the pie, and mushroom/olives/green peppers and sausage on the other 1/2.  Also had an order of the breaded mushrooms which were excellent.  When the pizza arrived I definitely was not disappointed.  I've been to Lou Malnatis, Giordanos, Ginos East, and Unos and I must say this pizza is definitely up there.  I would definitely recommend their pies over Lou Malnatis.  If you're from Chicago and have pizza places like this around, I would be embarrassed to be ordering pizza from Pizza Hut, Dominos or Papa Johns.  Definitely give this place a try and you will not be disappointed."
"Best pizza in Chicago; the carmelized cheese crust kills it.  Fun fact: The owner loves Moby Dick, hence the name Pequod's.  If you order the Pequod salad, they cut the mozzarella into whale shapes!Deep dish Sausage, Mushrooms, and Jalapeno pizza; end of story."
"The best Chicago style pizza, period! We were in Chicago for 4 days and came here 3 times.Pizza's are big, delicious and made to order. (it could take up to 50 minutes!)The service is really great and waiters are nice and attending. They are open till late (2 am) and they welcomed us on our arrival night at around 1:45 am You should definitely give them a try and you won't regret."
This deep dish pizza is the best I've ever had! I wish I had know to order ahead but it was my first time there so now that I do know I will order ahead! I loved the Carmelites mozzarella cheese! So delightful! I have to come back!
"This is the hidden gem of Chicago Style pizza! I love it here - The pizza is delivered in the pan that was bake, and the cheese that crisp on the ledge of the pan is just exactly what your mouth needs to start this adventure of flavor.Pequod's pie would not disappoint even a New Yorked - who think their pizzas are better."
"Stop reading reviews and leave for this place. Now.Bold statement I'll claim: best deep dish in town. It's all in the crust and the ingredients are super fresh. Decent beer prices (we ate in) and pretty quick service considering all the take out orders.My only knock would be don't get the fried app platter, it was fairly average relative to the pizza and not worth the price. Overall a great experience and I will keep coming here as long as I live in the neighborhood."
"Overlooked gem in the ever-ongoing question of Chicago pizza. Caramelized pan crust is unlike anything else in the city. Those who know, know, so be prepared for a long wait on weekends and Hawks games. Drop by the Drinking Bird for a cocktail afterward, or catch a movie across the street, for a great night out."
"Pequod's is a great place and you're guaranteed a different experience depending on what day/time you go. I love when they seat us upstairs because it is a little more quiet especially on a busy night or during a sports game. We love going there before/after seeing a movie at the theater across the street. We've had times that we've gone when the wait was an hour and there's also been times where we walk right in. If it's about a 25-30 minute wait it's no problem to sit at the bar and grab a drink,Their pizza is AMAZING. It's the perfect mix of sauce and cheese and the crust is delicious. The thin crust is amazing but if you have time the deep dish is worth the wait. Their appetizers such as the garlic bread are pretty basic but still delicious."
"For $5 you really cannot beat their lunch special, and this place has some damn good pizza. A bit dim and bar like considering this place is mainly a restaurant but I still enjoyed it. Worth a visit if you're in the Lincoln Park area!"
"Best Pizza spot in Chicago hands down! Crispy crust, melty cheese, robust sauce, premium toppings. Been coming here for years and will continue to do so!"
"Delicious deep dish with the caramelized crust, good jazz on the radio, will go back. Not much ambience. But its chicago, what do you expect?"
"The caramelized crust is a layer of burnt cheese around the edges of the pie and provides an amazing, unforgettable flavor (think of burnt cheese on baked ziti) with a crunchy/chewy texture.  The crust (dough part) itself is buttery, slightly chewy, but also a bit crunchy.  Delicious.  Additionally, this deep dish pie provides a better balance of cheese and toppings to crust - about 60/40 crust to topping, which is different from the normal 30/70 crust to topping ratio you see at other places.  In short, tasty and filling, but not overwhelming.I like this place better than Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Gino's East.  Definitely a must try if you are in the market for an amazing deep dish pie.Pictures / reviews here:  thegluttonousjd.com/2011…"
"The best deep dish pizza in Chicago.We recommend / usually have: 1 deep-dish pie with Sausage, Onion and Green Pepper, a 2nd pie with garlic and spinach, along with a pint of Elliot Ness and a pint of Green-Line pale-ale.When my wife & I moved to Chicago, one of the first foods we'd sought out was a true ""Chicago-style"" pizza. At the recommendation of her brother, a long-time Chicago resident and Northwestern Alum, we had Pequod's and its caramelized crusts did *not* disappoint.Other pizza-places we've had since have not been able to match up. Pequod's can get a bit crowded, and if seated upstairs, you'll find yourself with larger parties and / or families, but the food is well worth it and the staff is very friendly and always attentive."
This was my first taste of Chicago deep dish and is so far my favorite one. Can't beat that caramelized crust! Pizza is great and super filling (go small- two of us ate one small pie and we each had leftovers).
"Delicious, filling, crispy crust, fantastic burnt cheese on each piece, I especially loved the anchovies :-)"
"Best pizza in Chicago, hands down, especially if you eat at Pequods (so it's hot off the oven). I'm a big fan of the pepperoni deep dish and the thin crust is great too!The lunchtime deal (personal pizza and beer) is a great special even though it's difficult to make it out there during the week.Best advice - make a reservation through the website. It doesn't guarantee that you will get a table exactly at your appointment but at least you will be at the top of the list. Also call your order in ahead of time (deep dish takes an hour to cook)."
Every summer I visit Chicago and look forward to having a Chicago style pizza. This place did not disappoint. The service was friendly and attentive. We sat by a sunny open window while we enjoyed excellent deep dish delights. The beer selection was pretty good as well. Couldn't of asked for a better spot. Thank fellow Yelpers for the recommendation!
Definitely front runner for the best pizza in Chicago. I can tell that the ingredients were fresher than most and had a very distinct flavor. I brought my sisters to here to give them the real Chicago deep dish experience and that's exactly what they got.
"We ate here for dinner last night (Sunday). We came early, around 4, after going to museums all day. There were plenty of tables and we were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive. We ordered a small deep dish pizza with half mushrooms and half sausage and peppers. I had never had deep dish pizza, and usually I prefer thin crust. However, this pizza was very good and better than I had expected! There was a nice crunch to the bottom of the crust that I really liked. I would come here again if I was in the area."
"good pizza, pepperoni, extra sauce. wings are decent. you will always wait 30min for sure... but they allow you to place your order before being seated."
"I've been a diehard fan of a Chicago pizza chain that rhymes with Sue Pavarotti's since I can remember eating pizza. One of my buddies told me that I had it wrong, Pequod's is the ultimate in Chicago style deep dish. Psssshhhh. I've been drowning in deep dish forever and I've never even heard of them. But my roommates and I decided to give it a go. We were all skeptical, and I must confess that we were pretty biased and ready to write them off as just another pizza parlor. We could not have been more wrong. This is HANDS DOWN THE BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO. From the caramel ones crust to the fresh ingredients and amazing sauces, their pizza is unbeatable. The prices are pretty fair, too. If you fancy yourself a deep dish aficionado, or even just a true Chicagoan (those both go hand in hand, anyway) and you haven't been here, you're doing it wrong."
"Hands down, the best pizza in the city. In fact, this is the first meal I requested post-baby in the hospital. ;)"
This place is my personal heaven!  I CANNOT get enough Pequods - seriously the best Chicago style pizza in the universe!  They can get crazy crowded but it is honest to god worth the wait
"So yes, there are 1200+ reviews, with the average being 4 stars. We know it's  really, REALLY good pizza. But as a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I find myself frustrated with the many ill-informed reviews I read about our city's pizza. So I feel it's necessary to give my two cents on the matter to clarify the situation. Consider this your Chicago Style Pizzas 101. Beginning with the following:Pequod's is NOT -- I repeat -- NOT Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza. People assume that because the sauce is on top and it's cooked in a deep black pan, it must be deep dish. Well, that's incorrect. There are three types that are often labeled as ""Deep Dish"" which, while true they're all cooked in a ""deep dish,"" only one of those types actually qualifies as ""Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza. The difference is really about the crusts. A Chicago Style Deep Dish's crust is not overly thick and not really bready, but more like a pie crust (buttery, flaky). It often has an outer crust that's elevated above the rest of the dough, as if it were saying ""I am your master. WORSHIP ME.""  Examples are Gino's East and Lou Malnati's. Giordano's, Edwardo's and Art of Pizza are Stuffed Pizzas -- usually a similar crust as the deep dish, but they all have a really thin layer of dough on top of all of the toppings, which is covered with sauce (the sauce doesn't come in actual contact with most of the toppings in the prep, other than a small hole in the middle of it).Pequod's is PAN pizza. Yes, akin to Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza -- thick, bready-inside, slightly crispy-outside crust cooked in a pan. And that's where the similarities end.Because I've already written a mini-non-fiction here, I will be brief: Pequod's was a breath of fresh air to my tastebuds and could evolve to my new favorite place to get a 'Za in the city, Everything was balanced, and that carmelized cheese edge --- ohhhh man....The wait for a table and for our pizza was long, but as the old adage goes, ""Good things come to those who wait.""If I want deep dish, I'm going to Lou's. Stuffed? Giordano's is my place. But for pan pizza, Pequod's has no equal."
"The best Deep Dish in Chicago! Off the beaten path but well worth the trip! Weird location, weird building, weird space overall. Best crust! I'm not a fan of deep dish typically. I can eat this all day!"
"Not one of the big 3 names in deep dish, which rhyme with Moredanos, Dino's Yeast or Poo Pal Dotties.  But #1 in my book!  Pequod's is a place I've driven past many many times, and never bothered to even give it a second glance.  It's kind of like that girl you went to high school with who was always wearing paint-stained overalls with glasses and a side ponytail, and who you always knew existed but didn't want to talk to?  Eating Pequod's pizza is akin to said girl removing glasses, taking down the pony tail and getting into that skanky prom dress, you never knew, did you?  Now that I know, I get these really weird cravings for the crust at odd hours during the day.  Standing in an elevator.  Gotta have that crust.Doing paperwork at work.  Wish I was typing on a piece of Pequod's.Driving home.  Wish my seat belt was made of Pequod's so I could just lower my jaw and nibble on the belt.The best thing about Pequod's is the lunch special.  $4.95 is all a slice of heaven costs, along with a pop/beer.  You get 1 ingredient with your 7"" personal, so make it a good one.  Honestly though, even if you didn't put anything on it, it would be just fine.  The burnt looking thing on the crust?  It's actually quite good.  It's burned(or burnt if you're fancy) cheese that somehow doesn't taste burned, and lends awesome taste and texture to what normally wouldn't be all that great. Even without the burned rim the crust is amazing.  The fact that there isnt a ton of cheese in their pizza also makes this my favorite.  I hate when you're eating deep dish and your slice gets cold, which causes the cheese to seize up into this rubbery disk of dairy.  And every bite you take, you hate yourself more for.  These kind of shenanigans don't happen when you eat Pequod'sMy best friend who used to live here came to visit, along with his girlfriend.  So on our ""Chicago exclusive"" touristy day, Pequod's was where we took them for a late lunch.  My wife got a spinach and tomato personal, and the three of us split a sausage, mushroom and garlic large.  Holy balls.  I've had garlic on pizza before, but this was insane.  When they put the pie onto the whale trivet, the garlic aroma was so overpowering it hit everyone in the face and we all got black eyes.  I LOVE GARLIC.  My mouth is watering as I type these words...Giant chunks of sausage, large pieces of fresh mushroom and minced garlic everywhere, and the crust?  Oh, that crust  And that smelly garlic.  I'm glad I'm married and not looking because I felt like you could smell the pizza on me for three days after the meal.  I guess it didn't help that we had leftovers and I kept topping off my garlic smell level.  Pequod's is the perfect deep dish, for me and my wife at least.  In the 12 years that I've known her, never once has she had a craving for deep dish.  She's a cracker thin crust kind of gal.  Since we've eaten Peaquod's though, it's about a 4 week interval on the deep dish craving.  This fact alone is all you need to know how special Pequod's is.  Now go get some!I'm coming with you..."
"For my money, THE BEST pan pizza in Chicago! Fresh ingredients, real cheese beautifully caramelized at the edges by the seasoned pan, a crust that is the right combo of chewy and crispy, and holds up cold or warm the next day. Plan for leftovers. Locations are a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the trip."
Tried their pizza for the first time tonight and it lived up to everything I read. The crust was out of thus world. The toppings and sauce were piled on top. Couldnt ask for a better Chicago pizzeria!
So good! Best deep dish. So oily and full of delicious unhealthiness that though I did indeed have a second slice I should've stopped at the first.
"I've loved this place since they opened over 15 years ago and miss the days when you could walk in any day of the week and get a table.  I don't subscribe to the theory that Chicago has a ""best"" pizza because there are simply too many good pizzas out there - not to mention too many types of pizzas.  But I will tell you one thing for sure, of all the pizza I've had (and my cholesterol levels will attest to the fact that I have had a lot), Pequod's is my hands down favorite.  Is it the caramelized cheese? is it the spice blend they put on the top? is it the fresh ingredients? great service? I don't know, but for many many years now I, my extended family and friends have been coming here to celebrate many birthdays, showers, graduations, etc., and will continue to do so until we are able to.  LOVE this place!"
Love this place. In my opinion THE BEST deep dish in Chicago. You can't go wrong with the caramelized crust and you can tell the toppings are fresh. A bit of a wait for the pizza (depending on size) but definitely worth the wait. If you got people coming in from outta town you gotta take them here. Sorry Gino's east but the deep dish here is better.
"The best pizza in Chicago. I love their deep dish as well as their regular (thinnish) pizza. It has a loud, casual bar atmosphere which I happen to like. However, the restaurant should invest in a better take out operation. Anytime I order pizza for pick up the restaurant is so packed it is a hassle just to get to the pick up area. Then I have to ask the other 20 people crowded around the area if they have already paid/checked in with the staff because there is absolutely no organization. While I'm waiting for the pizza to come out I'm constantly bumped into by people who are trying to get to the bar, leaving with their carryout pizza, checking in with the host, ect."
"While in Chicago, the crusted cheese is just decadent and heart-attack worthy.  So good"
"This is the best pizza I have ever ate and I have ate a lot of pizza.! The crust is like no other. I disagree with some previous reviews I read stating you need to ask for extra cheese and sauce, the pizza was perfect."
"Called in advance for a priority seating on a friday night and literally waited 15 min tops. That said, our server Emily was extremely attentive and friendly. As for the pizza...hands down the BEST DEEP DISH pizza when compared to all the chains and hole in the walls I have been to in and around the Chicago area. Take my word for it,  if you're into cheesy, saucy, meaty or veggie goodness please take the time and visit this authentic Chicago gem. =)"
"Very good pan pizza, yes it is more on the bread-y side but that is their signature along with their delicious caramelized crust. One of the best pan pzzas in the city!"
"Ohhhhhh my goodness. Pequod's has sold me on their caramelized crust, plentiful toppings, and fantastic dough. Also, I was with a big crowd and would never order this on my own...but their thin crust is also good! Contemplating being a little bit healthy? Their Pequod's Salad is delicious! In my mind, Pequod's can do no wrong.The thing that sets Pequod's apart from other deep dish options is their dough and crust. The combo of doughy-ness with the crispy goodness of the crust is unique to any other deep dish I've had. Must have combination: sausage, giardinara, green pepp and onion. Their pepperoni is also pretty fantastic. Word to the wise, if you get a craving during a weekend day when football is on...try to have the craving a few hours before you want to eat. Delivery on a weekend afternoon has been known to take an hour and a half. Cut down on delivery time by picking up or eating in. However, I'd bring if home so you can recline on your couch after consumption without having to waddle out of the restaurant."
"Been here several times but this is my first review.  My wife and I love the pizza here.  Best in the city in my opinion.  Their sausage and pepperoni are the best I've ever had.  It was the downfall of my waist line when I found out they delivered to my old neighborhood.  We now live in central Pennsylvania where good pizza does not exist, so any time we are in town this is a place we must stop."
"Best deep dish in the city or the entire world hands down!!!!!! I love this place and is a go to anytime I crave a deep dish. The cheese crust and endless options to add, I can pile as much on my pizza and not quite break the bank and have food left over as well."
"Pequod's is a gem. Great pan pizza (slightly different that the typical Chicago Style Deep Dish). The caramelized crust is what makes all the difference. Packed on the weekends, but worth the wait- ask if you can order your pizza while you wait. The lunch combo is hard to beat."
"I, like most non-native Chicagoans, was enamored with deep dish pizza when I first arrived in this fair city, but have since fully moved on.  Still, like every resident of Chicago, I regularly receive out-of-town visitors who insist on sampling this local cuisine.Pequod's is, by far, my favorite deep dish pizza, and if given the opportunity to steer this rube of a visitor who insists on wasting one of their precious Chicago meals on this food, I will make every concerted effort to take them here."
"I finally made my way to Peaquod's Pizzeria after hearing a lot of buzz about how they offer one of the best tasting pizzas in Chicago.  There are two levels to this restaurant: first floor has a bar vibe to it with its stools and high tables while the second floor offers a pizzeria feel with its booths.  My party opted to sit upstairs because it was less crowded and noisy.We started off with some cheesy garlic bread and breaded mushrooms, which were nothing special.  It tastes just like any other pizzeria I have been to.  For pizza, we decided on thin crust, yea I know I know...it all about the deep dish but we're just not deep dish kind of people.  We got half pineapple and bacon and half pepperoni and sausage.  Oh my goodness, this pizza was delicious.  There was something about the seasoning and the crust that pushed this pizza to the next level.  The cheese was cooked just right that it was still bubbling and gooey when it came out.The service here was also pretty good.  Our waitress was really attentive and had a great sense of humor.  She served us each a slice of pizza when it came out and made sure all our drinks were still full throughout our meal.  Greatly appreciated!  The only thing I have to complain about is their cleanliness.  The table was sticky and the seats were full of crumbs from previous customers.  How hard is it to take a rag and wipe it down?  Eh....even though it's not that clean, it's not a deal breaker.  I'll still come back for their delicious pizza."
Pequod's has very good deep dish pizza and the crust is what distinguishes it from other pizzerias in the city (though keep in mind that the crust is harder and maybe a little more blackened than other crusts).  The wait can be especially long but you can always order the pizza to go and browse the shelves at Barnes and Noble or another location while you wait.  The atmosphere is nice as well - it is a smaller restaurant than a Gino's East or Lou Malnati's but it also makes the experience a different one than going to a regular chain.
"My fav pizza place in Chicago! It's pan style pizza (or choice of thin crust) so the crust is thicker, but DELICIOUS. It's a popular place so go during off hours. I went right after work on a Wednesday and got there at 5:45...not too bad, but avoid it during dinner rush on the weekends. I wouldn't suggest getting any of the salads, it's nothing special. Although, I did enjoy the whale shaped mozzerella :)I also got delivery on lonely Friday night and I don't suggest it. If you're going to eat Pequods, dine in. The pizza came 1 hour and 30 min later due to it being a Friday night around dinner time (understandable). But by the time I dived in to eat it, it was soggy and not as hot."
"For the record, I consider myself a HUGE pizza connoisseur . I traveled to Chicago for a food tour using my handy and very helpful Yelp App. One of first stops was Pequod's Pizzeria. I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich and a deep dish pizza. The sandwich came out first and to my surprise, dominated the remaining food tour. This was a unique Italian Beef Sandwich with melted cheese and a caramelized crust on the bread. The pizza was great too, but this sandwich stole the show. I have talked about traveling back to Chicago just for that sandwich. (From Nevada)."
"Decided to finally give them a try after many friends told us how great they were. We ended up ordering for carry out instead of eating in which in why for right now we are only giving them 4 stars. We ordered cheesy garlic bread which was nothing special but still very tasty. We also ordered the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers and it was very good. Also decided to get a small thin crust pizza, I know many people rave about the deep dish but my husband and I feel it is to heavy so we try to limit the amount of deep dish pizza we ingest. The thin crust reminded us more of a pan style pizza rather than normal cracker thin crust pizza. That being said it was still very delicious and they didn't skimp on the toppings! Definitely would order from them again and will have to eat there in order to find out how their service compares."
"This is the best deep dish pizza ever. I have gone here a million times and it is always the same quality and same taste! Never been to a place that is so consistent in their food quality and flavor!What I really love? Besides the caramelized crust and the quality of toppings, I love the quantity of sauce on their pizza! It is always perfect! Just the right amount, which doesn't make their pizza go dry, even if you take it home and eat it the next day!No other place is of any comparison to Pequod's. It is worth all the hype!!I would recommend going on a week night to avoid the long wait on weekends!"
Best pizza in Chicago.  I make sure to bring all out of town guests here when they visit.
"Creme Fraiche! Like Randy Marsh I was in food bliss. I had read all about the hype of Pequod's as the city's best deep dish (or is that pan?) pizza. I'd need reinforcements for this excursion. My buddy that just relocated to the area met up with Kris and I for our afternoon feast. No waiting to be seated and we had a nice booth in the corner. Based on a little Yelping research I knew deep dish was the thing to get here. Great taps of seasonal brews from Half Acre, Sam Adams and New Belgium. We put together an order while we got started on pitcher one of NB's 2 Below. Spinach, mushroom, garlic, extra sauce and light cheese for the lady. Sausage, pepperoni, garlic and extra sauce for the gents. It would look kind of odd if Kris and I both got our own pies, so I'm glad my buddy solved that problem for us. About the time we moved onto our second pitcher, the dude showed up struggling to hold our pizzas. Right here dude! These things clunked down on the table like they were Grandma's old cast iron skillet. They smelled fantastic for starters, that would be the garlic. We wasted no time tackling these pies. It's a little thick for my taste (that's what she said) which is why you'll want to go with extra sauce. The sauce is tangy and a bit spicy, but not sweet at all. I liked the charred cheese around the rim of the crust. That's a nice touch that added another level of flavor. The garlic and pepperoni kicked in with some spiciness and the big chunks of fenneled sausage were tasty. Pretty damn good. I liked this one better than the veggie, but they were both great. Our beer and za gluttony hit Thanksgiving levels as we caught up and the brew flowed on to the third pitcher. Things were not expensive at all. I think our pies were $25 even with all the toppings and the pitchers were about $17. That's a steal that we'll surely take advantage of again. I also liked that they had all the accompaniments of red pepper, grated cheese and herbs on the table already. I had an excellent afternoon buzz by the time we left and had such a great time that I halted the cab dead in it's tracks when I realized I had forgotten our leftovers at Pequod's. I think I was about halfway down the block in pouring rain when I heard Kris ask if I was really going back to get them. Is this man serious about pizza? I think so. 4.5 stars"
Love their deep dish - if carmelized cheese and crust is your thing you'll love pequod's.
"To keep myself from being redundant with other reviews, Imma get down to the nitty gritty. Paired my small pan pizza w/ith a couple 312 brewskies. + caramelized crust.-it really is INCREDIBLE. even tastier the next day. super buttery and slightly chewy to complete the perfect crust+ ingredients are so fresh & I dig the choice of toppings        ** sausage - homemade, big cuts of peppery, savory meat :) mmm        ** canadian bacon- need I say more??         ** garlic- for extra kick         ** black olives, green and red peppers, mushrooms, onions, and basil. Thankfully, we were seated upstairs so it was pretty spacious and quiet. Our server could have been better. Think she was frazzled manning the upstairs room by herself.  I did get a free 312 since she made a mistake on the order. Pequods lived up to its hype. Most indubitably. I'll be checking out Morton Grove location with parentals real soon. Gotta get it. Good. Now try to say that three times fast. gotta get it good.."
"This is my all time favorite pizza place! I'm a Chicago girl born and raised and I know deep dish, this is the only place to get some real good deep dish in Chicago. The crust is amazing but it doesn't over power like Giordanos and the sauce is delicious unlike Lou Malnati's that gets their sauce straight from a can of Chef Boyardee. It's a crime in the city of Chicago to have deep dish anywhere else than Pequod's! If you got tell'em I sent you and order a big sausage and onion pie for me!"
"The stuffed pizza is crazy good! I had no complaints. But for some odd reason, Giordano's somehow tasted slightly better. Lol weird."
"My favorite go with a big group of old friends and family, and spend 4hrs catching up pizza :). The purest out there would say that Pequods deep dish is not really a deep dish, but who cares when that crust is so delicious! Go check it out, you will leave with no regrets!"
"Obviously, the deep dish battle in Chicago will never reach a conclusion. That being said, Pequod's is my favorite. The deep dish is similar to Lou's but really does have that homemade taste that the larger chains lack. I tend to go for the Italian sausage and mushroom, but the pepperoni is also excellent. The sauce is somewhat plain, but allows for the toppings to really come through. I would ignore any thoughts about appetizers, none of them have really stood out to me and the pizza really does deserve your empty stomach.Make a reservation if you have a larger party or you will end up waiting for quite awhile. I went with my family (6) mid-week and was quoted for 40 minutes, learned my lesson! Overall, definitely worth the trip."
The BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago...the country!  I've been getting pizza from Pequods for over 20 years and it never disappoints.
one of the best deep dish places in town.  and theyre open late!
"Amazing pizza!  Some of the best pizza in all of Chicago, rivals anything else the city has to offer."
"Really, really good pizza. There was a TON of sauce on top of the (deep dish) pizza, and I think the sauce helped bring together my somewhat random choices of topping (pineapple + anchovies + tomato & basil). The wait, however, was obscene. They said 45 minutes but we ended up waiting for an hour and a half..."
"How have I lived in the Chicagoland area my whole life an never been here until last Monday? What is wrong with me?This now ties for my favorite Chicago style pizza place (see also: Toni's Pizza & Organic Pasta) I went with two people and a medium size pan pizza was just enough. I love that not only is their pizza amazing, but they have a solid beer selection to pair with it."
This place is great.  Lunch special is amazing and filling but that deep dish is DA BOMB.
"Wow wow wow. Pequod's is now my favorite thin crust pizza - not just in Chicago, but anywhere! We stopped in here for an early lunch on a Saturday, and it was basically empty. It was then (along with seeing the TVs and bar) that I realized this is probably more of an evening/pizza/beers scene, but I would go back for any meal. We were a little taken aback from the prices ($15.90 for a large, plus ~$2 for each topping) but once we saw actually how large the ""large"" was, it made sense. The two of us were able to eat both lunch and dinner off that one pizza. We ordered ours with pepperoni, sausage, and giardiniera which was a great combo to start with. But it was their seasonings, the crust, and the thinness of the pizza in general that put it over the top. So many flavors, so delicious.The service was attentive and I think it was either the manager or owner who came by to see how everything was. For two of us and two pops, it was about $30 including tip. I can't wait until we go the next time so I can try the deep dish, or the $4.95 lunch special!"
"Ive had my fair share of Chicago deep dishes, but this is a place I've been looking forward to trying for a long time.  And it delivered on all the hype!  The crust isn't too heavy like other deep dish places and the high temp crush lends to some amazing flavor.  If you are keen to try amazing deep dish, put this place in your top 3."
"Wonderful carmalized crust!This place is my favorite pizza place! They're wonderful! Excellent service, excellent food. The pizzas are fantastic. They don't skimp on the toppings, and the crust is always a crispy golden brown (perfection!). We always get a large, so that there's plenty of leftovers. The best thing about this place is that they're open until 2am!"
"Love this place ! Great for groups and I actually suggest you should come with one anyways since the pizzas take a while to cook you'll need company to pass the time with. They're close to the Webster st movie theater and a barnes and noble as well as within a mile or two of some great shops so I feel I always stop in whenever I'm in the middle of an errand. I always order extra cheese with sausage and it's delicious! It's huge so I end up with leftovers but I'm totally fine with that. Most of the time the servers are very attentive and I rarely ever have an empty glass of water but I know on their busiest nights they seldom forget. I'd like to sit at the bar next time around and have a diff experience . Great taste, chill place and they have an upstairs too I believe !"
Pizza is good. Service was slow. We were in a back corner so maybe she forgot about us.
"I suffered for this pizza.It wasn't quite a walk through rain, ice, and snow, but it was cold, and drizzling a bit. Then we had to wait. And wait. And wait. Eff. We must've waited over an hour for this damn pizza. Then we waited a little bit more for our order, which we had placed when we gave the hostess our name, because we knew it'd be a wait.Was it worth it? I'm at a stage in life where I'd probably never voluntarily subject myself to this again. Unless it was suddenly divulged that David Bowie, circa ""The Hunger"" era would be serving it to me, and that we would make out afterwards. The staff at Pequod's are energetic and nice. There are benches outside, if it gets too claustrophobic inside. The caramelized crust reminds me of getting the corner piece of homemade lasagna.I liked it. But next time, I'll make sure to go on an off night/time of day."
Great deep dish. Really really good thin crust (I was surprised). The only knock is they get too busy so it's best to order at odd hours. It's definitely on my Chicago Pizza Mount Rushmore.
"We travel to Chicago every holiday and crave Chicago style pizza but with 2 young kids, it's difficult to not be on a long wait and the standard downtown pizza haunts. . It's uncommon to have pizza joints take reservations but Peqoud's did!!  We were seated right on time and the staff was excellent and attentive to our kids---and the pizza was some of the best we have had in Chicago. We will be back again!!"
"Pizza is one of the best in Chi town, while ur here try the wings they are really good."
"Best deep dish pizza plus far fewer boner tourists than all those other Chicago-style pizzerias.  THIS is where locals get their pizza, complete with a crispy caramelized crust.Surprisingly bigger than it looks with rooms upstairs, there is a bar on the second floor if waiting downstairs is too crowded."
"I have only had deep dish pizza (not BJ's) one other time at Zachery's in Berkeley but this was my first time eating the real thing. My bf and I split a small pizza and packed it with tons of toppings. It was delicious, came out super hot, filling but not heavy. We killed the small pizza and were stuffed in a good fatty kind of way."
"Make a reservation.  It was nice watching St. Louis send San Francisco to the World Series (in style), but a playoff game has a finite start and end.  Waiting to sit while standing in a very crowded doorway where it's warm, or sitting and catching a bit of breathing room in the freezing cold does not.  ""Forty-five minutes"" is like telling someone it's just up the road five miles when they're driving in the country.  The wait went on for an e.t.e.r.n.i.t.y.  They let us pre-order our pizza so that when we sat, we wouldn't have to wait for eternity, part 2.  Once we sat (we had our own chairs! and table!  in the warm!  and got to catch the end of the game!), we only had to wait another ten minutes or so.Will the wait make our pizza taste like hype?  Will our pizza have been burnt to a crisp, then turn cold waiting for us?  When did Mike Matheny retire AND become a coach?!  These were the questions shooting through our minds and empty bellies.  (I think I just had a flashback to Soap - pardon me.)The pizza was amazing and okay.  You really need to start at the edge, then work your way in.  The outside crust is a perfect soft/crisp pizza cracker, flavored with years of other pizzas.  The crust is caramelized with prior pizza's flavorings and cheese, then burnt just enough.  Like the good pieces of a macaroni and cheese casserole, only with a great fatty cheese flavor.  The ingredients on the pizza are fresh - a definite score in my book.  (Home run sounded too cheesy - do I get quadruple points for a double pun, make that a triple pun?)  The center is a tad undercooked.  It's almost doughy.  Not all together bad, just not as brilliant as the outer crust.  The sauce is a bit bland, too.  Not stewed tomatoes bland, jut not zesty.I'd definitely return if I had a reservation, but I think I'd try Malnati's first."
"About as good as deep dish gets in my book. The cheesy crust may look burnt but it's the best part of the pie - don't throw it away! On the downside, something clearly needs to be done about the wait times given that reservations aren't really taken."
"....better than Lou's?  I must have just shortened my life expectancy by uttering those blasphemous words.  I dont care.  My new benchmark for Chicago pizza is Pequods.  A few simple reasons why I have redefined my pizza pecking order....1.  Balance: Crust...cheese...and that SAUCE create a perfect triumvirate of flavor that is in complete harmony.  It isnt a wheel of cheese with some diced tomotoes....2.  The carmelized crust....I dont eat my crust ANYWHERE else ....but here.3.  The SAUCE is flavorful...and finds its way into every bite because there is plenty of it4.  It isnt a chain...so their quality control is stellar and meals are handcrafted instead of that  ""assembly line"" vibeThe atmosphere is fun and they have enough TVs to make it a fine game day option.  Hey... This is pizza...not foie gras.  It should be simple...and in Chicago...it should be GREAT.  Food is like art...and noone can tell you what tastes good to your mouth...but I cant imagine anyone defining Chicago pizza any better."
"Here's the clincher with Pequods pizza: they have this awesome way of burning the crust on the edges so that the crust caramelizes, you eat it, and then your taste buds simultaneously implode and explode.This is the pizza place you take out-of-towners to when they ask you to present the best pizza in Chicago. I once ordered Pequods for my buddy's bachelor party and throughout the night received no less than 5 compliments on the excellent pizza recommendation. No less!Also literally every time I have ordered delivery the pizza is EXACTLY the same. I don't know what kind of ritual they perform to make sure the pizza is always consistently awesome, but it's powerful, old, and dark magic."
You go to pequods for the caramelized crust edges which are Chicago pizza magic. You want them hot and crispy. This means eating in is better than delivery. And personal size pizzas maximize the crust to center ratio.
Pizza is made fresh and is oh so delicious.  Definitely get the deep dish!  Only downfall is the long wait time but that is the price to pay for freshly made pizza.
"IMO the best deep-dish in Chicago.They already have over a thousand reviews, but I'll just add my $0.02 for good measure.  I don't even particularly like deep dish, but damn, I can always make an exception for Pequod's. The best for me is a pan pizza w/ pepperoni and onions. Yes, it is as good as everyone is saying.The few times i've gotten vegetable toppings I was underwhelmed. They were still crispy and tasted raw, like they were thrown on at the last minute. Maybe that's how it's supposed to taste, but I prefer cooked toppings even if they shrivel a bit. Another gripe I have is the time it takes for them to get the pizzas out. I seem to remember waiting upwards of 50 minutes a few times, which seems a bit long. Whatever - just have a few beers in the meantime!"
"Hands down- my favorite Chicago style pizza. The sauce, burnt cheese, it is everything. Takes a while to make but it's so worth it. Great atmosphere.  Nice area of the city.  I take all my friends here."
UPDATE:  Make sure to give yourself 45-60 mins on the weekends for the long line. I think it's worth it...
Best Deep Dish Pizza I've ever had. The Crust is just out of this world. This is the Pizza I came to Chicago for.
"Ok this Pizza Joint single handly tops all the pizza joints in Chicago. I would go here over Lou's! The crust was baked to perfection, and the ingredients that were used was of the highest quality. The place may seem small on the outside, but when we were taken upstairs, I couldn't believe how big the restaurant became. Seriously, skip Lou's come here!"
"Definitely my favorite spot for deep dish.  The wait can be a little long if you try to show up at 7-8 on a Friday or Saturday, but what did you expect? Service has always been great.  We had family in from out of town last week, so of course we took them to Pequod's.  The owner happened to be walking around and he came by to chat with us for a few minutes, made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant."
"Saw this place on ""Chicago's Best"" for best pizza, and it did not disappoint! Great deep dish pizza, one of the best we had. The way the crust at the top of the pizza was caramelized because of being cooked by the pan is something that can't be duplicated. Great Pizza!Great atmosphere also, nice little place in Lincoln Park where you can have a beer, catch a game and have a great pizza.If im back in the area I'll defintely stop by again."
"So I found out about this place while eating brunch at The Publican. I love Pizza and have had Lou Malnati's before so I felt obligated to try this. 1) Whale with a Thong - So when I saw the picture I said ""is that a whale with a thong on its face?"". Yes, yes it is. I have no clue while Fudgy the Whale's debauch brother rides a motorcycle with a woman's thong (or cows thong?) on its face, but more power to him.2) Pizza - Wow. I honestly prefer Chicago pizza and this was awesome. I ordered cheese and sausage and had to force myself to stop eating. Thick, airy, buttery crust. Sauce and cheese in the right amounts. Thick slices of sausage. The whole thing was perfect. A medium can feed 3 humans so order appropriately. The restaurant also has a great bar vibe. I could see just drinking beer and watching the Blackhawks or Cubs here. Loved everything about it. I also ordered fried zucchini which was fine. I will 100% go back."
We were told by my friend and tried their deep dish pizza. It was better than our expectation. Its price is reasonable. Would come back and try different thing
"Normally, I go for pizza mainly for cheese and go for thin crust at most places, but Pequod's deep dish is amazing that you'll be crazy not to get it!  It's already been said many times, but the best part is the crispy cheesy crust.  I had a sausage and mushroom, and it was heavenly delicious!  Ordered for pick up and it took 30 minutes.  Quick and easy.  Would love to come back and sit down to enjoy it while watching a game next time."
"This is the greatest pizza in Chicago. Period. I've had Lou's and Giordano's and local spots and this blows all out of the water. I had this pizza from delivery on a rainy Valentine's day with my girl and fresh out of the oven with my colleagues and it is consistently delicious. The sauce is impeccable (not too sweet or too watery) and the crust is a caramelized delight. It's deep dish that isn't overly bready. Don't even bother with thin crust, just go for the special. You'll have to wait a little while for it to cook, but it is worth all the pennies!"
"Love this place. Pizza is fantastic, they have pitchers of beer and the staff is friendly. What else can you ask for?"
"Best ""pan"" pizza I've had. Crunchy but light crust, and really fresh toppings. Personal size actually works if you're starving. Limited, but good, beverage  options. Call ahead as a wait is usual, and if you can order ahead - do it. 1 hour for the pizza, but worth it."
I love Pequod's pizza. It's totally unique in the world of pizza. The signature browned edge is great. I feel like I don't go there often enough.
"Deep dish glory.  Service is spotty at times, but if you want to watch Chicago sports ant eat Chicago food, go here."
"I've made my rounds though standard fare Chicago deep dish options. I had the pepperoni here and it was great. I was pleasantly surprised by the discounted lunch special personal pizza. The larger sizes  may have a better ratio of crust to toppings, but it came out with a tasty crunchy crust, great flavor, and was extremely good throughout.this is a destination if you have the means to make it out of the city. If you're stuck, Gino's east or Lous are top notch."
"Finally tried their pizza after hearing about it for forever and seeing it on the Food Network for best deep dish in the city. It was delicious! Not like most deep dish pizzas. I really liked that you could pick it up and eat it in hand rather than with a fork like most deep dish, and the pepperoni was perfectly crisp on top. There wasn't as much cheese as I'm used to and I think it is overall less than most deep dish pizzas. It wasn't too saucer which I appreciated. The bottom crust was really thick and I'm not sure how much I loved that, but they bake cheese on the outside rim of the crust which I really liked it. We also got fried mushrooms that were really good! One of my fav appetizers. We only ordered take out so I haven't been in, but I will be back again for sure!"
"Pequods seriously changed my mind entirely about Chicago style pizza, and now I call nearly every Saturday at 6:00pm (yes, very long delivery times. Prepare yourselves.) It's always the same: Medium pie with garlic and green pepper eaten while watching Svengoolie at 9pm (with a romantic partner. My life isn't that sad.)"
"Remember coming to this place way back in the day like in 96 when it was not crowded and not all hyped up like it is today. I used to work across the street at the movie theater and myself, and the crew used to come on over after work; and have drinks and eat. Pan Pizza is still the same unique flavor with the famous burnt caramelized crust. I'm giving it four stars due to there lack of taking proper reservations/system for a table without waiting. I tried coming here the other day and called ahead and forget about it. Place had boat loads of people waiting outside. Even though you call ahead you still have to wait two and a half hours to be seated; and then an hour and a half to get your food! If they have gotten this popular throughout the years; then they need to have a proper reservation system in place and not a stupid podium with arrogant high school kids taking phone calls and names!"
"Pequods pizza makes everything better...well at least feelings of frustration resulting from their inadequate and nonsensical system for requesting a table.  As advertised on their website, I made a request for priority seating a few days ahead of our visit. When we arrived at the time we had indicated on said request, we were told it would be about 15-20min, which is totally understandable. The frustrating part came when groups of walk-ins who came in after started to be seated before us. Even more frustrating was that the 15-20min was more like 45-50. But like I said, the pizza went a long way to making me feel better. This was one of those rare times when the food lived up to the hype. Although a bit pricey, the pizza had a really good balance of sauce and cheese...with the chunks of sausage being huge and flavorful. While I would go back, the price and long wait time prevent me from doing it more often."
"Not much else to say about this place that hasn't been said.  Amongst the best pizzas (and deep dish) in Chicago, and certainly the best crust.My only caution:  coming here with large groups, or really any group of more than two, takes forever.  Almost all the tables are for parties of 2.  I waited 90 minutes past my reservation time once for a table for 3 to open. Love the customer service!  Ordered a pan carry out once, took it all the way home before we realized it was thin crust.  We were disappointed -- this is our go to place for deep dish -- but the manager called me personally in less than 24 hours and comped us our original order after I wrote.This is the kind of food and customer service that engenders loyalty!"
"Made my second visit to Pequod's last Friday; I will have to go back more often for sure.  I was big on the carmelized crust the first time around but the pepperoni toppings and the sauce were a minor letdown.  This time, on the advice of my new friend Jeremiah, we got a medium deep dish with sausage...damn, this was good.  The meat was incredible and the crust was slightly less burned this time out so I could take down every inch of real estate.  Service was fast and the crowd was lively....in fact, when we left around 7, there was a huge line outside.  Didn't know Pequod's was this popular!"
"This is my favorite pizza in the entire city of Chicago. On the outside, it kind of looks like a hole in the wall bar. The prices are reasonable, and the pizza is so good. Go with the deep dish, my favorite is just deep dish with sausage and green pepper, and the portions are huge so I always have leftovers. Plus, they burn the crust, which sounds gross but it's amazing.I have a few complaints, but it's just SO good that I can't dock a star. Call ahead to get a table. Especially on the weekends, this place is packed.Also, it takes forever to get your pizza. Don't come starving, because you will wait for at least an hour. Overall, I recommend this place to everyone that moves to Chicago and comes to visit Chicago. Every single person has loved it and goes back all the time."
"I am a bit weird, I like burnt things. I like those few burnt potato chips you find in the bag or a nicely charred hot dog from the grill. That is why Pequod's is my kind of place. Not that the pizza is burnt, but the way they construct their deep dish is unlike any other in Chicago. The cheese actually forms a caramelized crust on the pizza which gives this delicious, almost burnt flavor. It is the most terrific thing you will eat. Being from Chicago, people ask me about Gino's or Lou Malnanti's, they ain't got nothing on Pequod's. I recommend this place to all those that travel to Chicago looking for a deep dish."
"In short: Very busy, no reservations but they do call aheads. And the pizza takes 50minutes (supposedly). So plan ahead. Awesome deep dish pizza.This pizza was quite excellent. We got the pan pizza, with half sausage & half cheese. It is a saucy deep dish pizza, with an awesome carmellized crust. They seem to layer the pizza - dough, cheese, sauce, toppings - which totally works for me! It was awesome!! We also got the cheesy garlic bread and some drinks. Overall I think this is my second favorite pizza in Chicago (Lou's is still first). We will definitely be back. Be sure to plan ahead tho - it gets really busy at this location (like standing on top of tables while people eat) and it takes 50min for a pizza (I guess when it's busy?!). You can place your order while you wait though, which I would highly recommend."
"Got this pizza on my lunch break the other day. Ordered by the slice, customized and ready in 10 minutes. The pizza was great and the service was quick. Loved it."
"Being a Californian, it's rare that I get a decent deep dish pizza around here. After Pequod's, I ALMOST got converted to this seriously intense pie, and I'm a thin crust pizza kind of girl.We noticed that they offered the thin crust variety but (of course) we opted for the small pan pizza, extra toppings: sausage, pepperoni, fresh garlic, and extra cheese. My was it lip-smacking, melt-in-your-mouth, porky, cheesy, garlicky goodness. And the crust, perfectly crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Definitely a game changer. This is not the slice of pie you eat with your hands, you've really got to get in there with a fork and knife. It's heavy and hearty and with only four slices we still had leftovers. Be patient, it's a thick, burly pizza so it will take about 30 minutes to cook. Completely worth the wait.I love the casual, sports bar atmosphere in here. Perfect place to come hang out, drink some brews, and share a pie."
"We tried Pequod's based on the suggestion of a local. We were kind of disappointed with Lou Malnati's on our first trip into the city - we thought it tasted too similar to Uno's, which we felt was just a chain restaurant we could go to back home. We definitely weren't disappointed this time! We sat down pretty quickly, but the wait was a bit long - an hour + for a pizza. I'm not one to complain though, so we were happy to hang out and wait. Loved the generous amount of sauce and toppings they use, and I'm a huge fan of the deep dish. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for ""the Chicago Pizza experience."""
Pizza was seriously good! It lives up to its reputation. The lunch special is certainly worth the price and I will be going back for more!
"5 stars for the food. The pizza has that delicious cheese caramelized on the crust. 3 stars for service. Be prepared not only to wait for your deep dish (at least 30-45 minutes), but table service is slow too. Great place to watch a game as there are TVs all around, and I've never been then when its been too loud."
"We went to Pequods last night and I think I am still full!!! OH soooooo yummy. My date ordered a large and then blamed me for letting him.  (:   Its way too big for two people.  But the left overs - not complaining.   We went traditional pan - w sausage.  The sausage ROCKS with generous amounts of anise - and just so full of flavor - onions, mushrooms and gardinier.  What?JEALOUS?  No need GO GET YOUR OWN - asap!!!LOVE"
"I had my first slice of deep dish pizza here a few nights ago. It was my first meal in Chicago, so I had to start it off right.I'm a fan of thin crust, so I wasn't sure how I was gonna like the deep dish action. I'm not a fan of things with a lot of dough. (For a long time, I would take the top bun off my burgers...) Anyway, the dough here was perfectly crunchy on the outside, with the inside being soft. The pizzas are made to order and you basically customize your pizza. YUM! I was so full after 1 1/2 slices...which is WEAK for me. Oh, but I also had a side of their fries and chicken wings which were hot, fresh and yummy, too.I would definitely recommend this place for deep dish!"
"I'm going to bump them up a star after giving the pizza a second chance.  My best gal and I were craving deep-dish and for some reason my memory of the aesthetic here called me like a siren.  It just seemed like the right kind of place from which to escape the summer Sunday heat.  Maybe because of the semi-darkness and blue light?Anyway, I still think that the pizza is strangely bland, but I tracked the problem to the sauce, so it makes more sense to me now.  It just needs more seasoning, I think.  Otherwise the pizza is pretty great, especially the crust, which manages to be crispy on the bottom and edges but bready in the middle.  The pizza reheats really well in a conventional oven, which is a rarity.We had an egregiously sullen (and often absentee) waitress.  However, they seemed to do a shift change while we were there, and all of the evening people seemed pleasant enough.  So maybe we just got a bad apple.Oh, and the upstairs men's room has a four-foot Gandalf head painted on the wall.  You don't see that every day...or actually, ever."
An absolut delight! Went for valentines day and they have Heart shaped PIZZAS!!! how awesome is that. make sure you order ahead becasue it is crazy packed always.
"Deep dish pizza doesn't get better than this.  I don't even usually eat this style of pizza, but I make an exception for Pequod's.  Generally there's plenty of seating, there's an upstairs area if you walk in and it feels crowded.  Service is fast and friendly."
Quality deep dish pizza. I had garlic bread salad and a few slices for lunch and didn't eat dinner after cause I was STUFFED. Would go there again.
"I grew up near a Giordano's so that has been my long-standing favorite Chicago deep-dish pizza (trumping Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, etc.). HOWEVER, Pequod's has changed my mind and become my new favorite. My parents are also on board after they tried it a few weeks ago. The sauce is amazing and the crust is so light and airy. It's a bit pricey when you add toppings but it's always worth it."
"Went here for lunch today.  First time.  $4.95 lunch special, with a one ingredient 7"" pizza, and a soft drink or Bud Light (so, colored water).  Everything about the pizza was pretty good.  Good crust.  Good sauce.  Good cheese.  Good sausage.  So ... good pizza.  The sausage was nice and peppery.  I like a little more fennel seed, but it was good.  Service was very good, and the atmosphere was fine.  Parking is street only around there.    Is it ""the best?""  I don't think so.  But the whole ""best pizza"" thing is subjective.  It's really hard to find a bad pizza in Chicago.  If the place has been open for 20 years, it's doing something well enough to make a bunch of people happy.  If it is new and it sucks, it won't last long."
"Peaquod's isn't really like the other deep dish/stuffed pizza places in the city. When I think Art of Pizza, Giorodanos, Lou's, I think of that really tall pizza with mounds of cheese and soft crusts. The pizza here isn't better or worse, it's just different.As the menu says, it's a deep dish pan pizza. The carmalized crust, as others have noted, is really great and the crunchiness carries over through the whole pizza. I ordered a personal pan pizza with mushrooms and pineapples and it was really great. It was a lot more reasonable of a portion than 7"" pizzas from the other pizza joints would have been.That said, it just doesn't compare - literally. It's not at all like the other deep dish places. Give it a try."
"Oh yeah, if you like pizza and love deep dish  pizza, then this is your spot.  Old hang out environment, they have seats downstairs with a bar and seats upstairs with a bar.  The crust is very tasty and is brushed with butter that then caramelizes when baked.  The only complaint I have is that the bottom crust was somewhat uneven in texture.  Do not know if this was usual or just a little extra crust folded over and a little bit more chewy than the other parts of the pizza.  Either way it is wonderful and 5 stars.  Dark upstairs, with posters, a bit better lighting and a very large bar.  Wonderful environment for watching sports or just a small party with friends."
"I have to say, I am a die-hard New York Pizza Guy , but Pequod's was awesome. The sauce was delicious, the sausage on the pizza tasted fresh comma and it was an all-around good experience. Just a tip, they have a fantastic lunch special pizza and a soda for $5. During my stay I went to 3 different pizza places, and this was the best one. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to go back."
"this is my favorite pizza in chicago. MUST GET PAN PIZZA!The caramelized crust is just fantastic. Don't be scared by the looks of it!Also, it is incredibly cheap. For a small pizza (4 big slices) it is like 12 bucks. You cannot get any better than this, especially as a college kid.Go here on the weekdays for lunch and its 4.95 for a personal pizza with a drink!I would give this 5 stars, but the service isn't the best. The pizza definitely makes up for it!"
"Holy iron skillet of Chicago-style ecstasy. My part-time Chicagoan amigo  brought me to Peqoud's, guaranteeing the best Chicago style pizza you could find in The Windy City, and boy did Pequod's deliver. I was advised to only eat two slices, as any more would be a fool's venture. Well, I was full after once slice of mile-thick pepperoni and mushroom 'za, had to keep up with the crowd and have a second slice, and then was still so impressed with the quality that I had to have a third. The third was the end of me. I went into straight coma/hibernation/cheese-overdose/cryo sleep after that. But wow, it was worth it."
"Growing up in the Midwest, I have certain expectations about Pizza.  Living in Oregon, I must settle for what I call, ""West Coast Pizza"".   It's not bad, but it's not like pizza I grew up with.A family reunion in Chicago allowed me the opportunity to satisfy my midwest pizza cravings.  This Place has awesome Chicago-style pizza (and thin crust as well - cut the way I like it: in squares instead of triangular slices).  That's all I have to say.  Awesome Chicago-style pizza.  Awesome."
"This is probably my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. Delicious, relatively fast, and great lunch special - $5 for a personal pan and a soda! Definitely go in if you are in the Lincoln Park area."
"is this real life? i think i blacked out during this meal or went into a trance of cheese and caramelized crust.  as my boy zubair khan would say, this is simply JAF.  the GOAT of pizza in Chicago"
"Straight away I should say I've never had deep dish pizza before so can't compare this with anything, but we loved our meal!We were in town for only a few days and having some deep dish was on our must do list. Did some googling and yelping and Pequod's got some fine reviews; we figured it was worth the trek out from the downtown loop. Indeed it was! Taking our server's advice, my husband and I split a small pan pizza. We were expecting it to be a grease-bomb (in a good way of course) so were pleasantly surprised to find it not so. Could have been our toppings chosen: sausage, onion, fresh tomato & garlic (best combo btw). We were def full, in fact I couldn't finish my second piece; luckily my husband was more than happy to. One thing we noticed... Most people don't seem to finish, which isn't terribly surprising, but they make a big mistake by not even touching the crust -- it's almost the best part!! It's got some kind of caramelised cheese thing going on there -- amazing!! If you cant finish a whole piece of pizza (no shame in that) make sure you eat from side to side, rather than tip to crust, otherwise you will miss out!!!I'm thinking our meal came to $25 bucks, including 2 bottles of rootbeer. Great value."
"We ordered a Large Pan Pizza for delivery on Friday night and it was fantastic. The associate who took our order on the phone was so genuinely nice and had great customer service; she was a doll. The pizza arrived much earlier than expected, and was still steaming! We dug in and couldn't even finish half of it- so much food! Loved the thick, soft crust and the sausage was very unique and tasty. We will be back! Pequods is better than Girodannos & Lou Malantis!"
"Pequod's was my favorite pizza experience on my recent visit to Chicago. The restaurant is kind of divey and cramped (though they have an upstairs seating area that is a little more roomy) but the pizza more than makes up for the lack of ambiance in the restaurant. The special thing about the pizza here is the ""caramelized cheese crust"" which basically just means they let the cheese ooze over the side of the crust so that it forms a burnt cheesy ring when cooked in the hot dish. Burnt cheese, people, it's a thing. This crust is PHENOMENAL. Do yourself a favor and add Pequod's to your list of must-try deep-dish spots!"
"my husband and I headed to Chicago for our anniversary and wanted to avoid the touristy places, especially for pizza. I really liked that we could call ahead too. When we arrived (around 5:30) there were quite a few open tables. It was kind of fun to watch the place fill up (we were near the front).we ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza and salads to start. everything was delicious and a small was definitely more than enough to fill us up! not only did we like Pequods but we also fell in love with the area it's in. the concierge at our hotel told us that there wasn't really anything else in that area. he couldn't have been more wrong!Pequods is definitely somewhere we'd return the next time we're in town!!"
"Rated number 1? Absolutely! Super Deep Dish delight! Staff was friendly and great with kids ordering food. Had a mushroom, onion and pineapple and it was great. Atmosphere is 'college' casual - a great dining experience. Just know that it's going to be a busy and it's going to take an hour to get your food - but it's well worth it!"
The Pequods I went to was in Morton Grove and its been great for over 35 years!!
"This is my favorite deep dish/pan pizza place of all time.  It's totally worth waiting through the cook time.  Aside from the pizza, I love the appetizer combo and the jalapeno poppers. The staff are all kind and helpful (they serve you at the table when they bring the pizza out - awesome) as well.  When I order for delivery, it never takes as long as they say but let's be honest, I wouldn't care if it took twice as long because it's so good."
"Y'all ... this is the place for deep dish. You MUST get here. Crispy, flavorful, filling, and local. No chain ingredients, no revolving door managers moving from one restaurant to another. Legit.We have become such big fans that we had our Wedding Weekend Friday night welcome dinner here, to give our family and friends the best taste of Chicago pizza there is.  So let me explain it to you ... real ... slow. A) Load it up. We get sausage, pepperoni, giardiniera, AND jalepenos. So a medium costs nearly $30. With six slices, you can consider two slices a FILLING $10 dinner, one slice a good solid $5 lunch, and the pizza is now a bargain. And they give MAD amounts of toppings.B) It will take longer than they say or longer than you think. Wait. It's worth it. If they say 40 minutes, expect 50. No biggie. Watch the Blackhawks, let your mouth water and your belly rumble.C) No, they didn't burn it. They put cheese on the outside of the crust to give it a salty, caramelized, crunchy texture that no one else can match. Embrace it. You'll never want a deep dish without it.D) Heat up your leftovers right! Here's how you do it:1) Get the pizza out of the fridge for @20 minutes before putting it in the oven to take the chill off.2) Get your oven up to 450 degrees, with your cast iron pan inside. Just before taking out the pan to put the pizza in, feel free to spread a small amount of oil or bacon fat on it.3) Place one or two pieces in the pan so that the edges are against the pan's edges, to re-crisp the outside.4) Plop it back in the oven, turn down the temp to 325, and heat it up for 5-8 minutes.5) Repeat with more slices as you wish.You now have the knowledge. Make it happen."
"I was excited to finally try this place! My friends and I ordered a pitcher of Half Acre and a large pepperoni pan pizza. The carmalized crust was a nice addition and the sauce was ok, nothing outstanding, but it was good. I read a few reviews that mention deep dish, which Pequod's does not have. They served pan pizza which is a bit different, so maybe that is why some people are disappointed. Only a few places in Chicago serve true deep dish.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch…"
Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. However it took 45 minutes to get our pie. So be prepared for a wait.
great pizza! im not really a pan pizza kinda guy but this pizza made me a believer. if you plan to go to this wonderful stablishment i highly suggest you go with time and a will to wait for 1 hour because it gets busy in there. service is good and the brews are better. definitely going back for more !
As good as Chicago pizza gets here! It is a wonderful pizza joint with a casual atmosphere and relaxed feeling. Great place to enjoy a slice and unwind!
"Absolutely delicious!  My 2nd favorite pizza spot. The crust is just the best and the slices are huge.  The service has always been pleasant. Depending on when you go your wait may be long but I guarantee its well worth it.  I've had appetizers,  salads,  and pizza from there. All have been very tasty."
"these deep dish pizzas are ridiculous. It's fully loaded goodness of cheese and good quality toppings. And a pitcher of beer is cheap here. Although it takes about 45 minutes for the pizza to cook, it really is worth it. That oily crust is outstanding. If anything, before going back to LA, I would order boxes to take home. It really is that good."
"I'm not from Chicago and don't know much about Chicago style pizza, but what I do know is that I really enjoyed my pie at Pequod's.  Sauce, crust, the flavorful sausage - all excellent and tasty. Other than that, I don't suppose the 1300th review of a much-loved institution is of much use, but I'll only add that I suspect Pequod's gets a lot of extreme reactions.  Its tradmark is a ring of caramelized cheese around the crust, and a very well-done exterior.  Some people like that (me) and others don't.  But whichever one of those you are, be prepared for the fact that this doesn't taste as much like other Chicago style pizzas as you might expect. In the end, I'm still partial to New York pizza, but Pequod's is an excellent example of what it is."
This place has great Pan Pizza with a phenomenal caramelized crust.  Sausage & Pepperoni all the way.
"Stopped here on our way through Chicago. We were looking for good Chicago pizza without having to go downtown. Their lunch special of a 7"" cheese pizza and soft drink was reasonably priced at $4.95. Pizza was great! Service was a little slow therefor I couldn't give it 5 stars. We will return!"
"I love me some deep dish from Quods.Their deep dish is great, among the best in Chicago. The carmelized cheese on the crust makes it what it is. Its much better when you eat-in (retains the crispiness), but delivery is still good. The thin crust is so-so. Its fine in a pinch but there are better places in Chicago. Eat-in if you can. There are always long lines but its a fun place to watch a Blackhawks game."
"Best pizza and best pizza deal in Chicago. I seriously love this place. Go between 11-3 on weekdays for the 4.95 lunch special, best deal in town. I'm seriously addicted."
"This is the best pizza in Chicago. I had pepperoni pan pizza, LOVED IT."
"Pequod's is a must-try for all Chicago-style lovers. Easily one of the top three best pizzas I've had in Chicago. Or anywhere, for that matter... since as everyone knows, Chicago has the best pizza in the world!So here's the dish on the deep dish:- The sauce wasn't the best I've had (I'm a sauce snob) but it was tasty, fresh, and definitely above-par.-  The amount of cheese was a bit on the lighter side compared to a Gino's pizza, but then again, I've nearly choked on the cheese there, so I'm okay with curbing the mozzarella overkill.- The toppings were huge and plentiful. (I recommend the Hawaiian if you like pieces of Canadian bacon the size of your face)But the crust! Oh, the CRUST! It was unlike any deep dish crust I've ever had, so light and fluffy and savory! It fills you up too: we had a group of 7 big eaters and we barely made a dint in our second pizza.The service and ambiance were forgettable, but that crust is not, so I will be returning very soon!"
"This was my introduction to deep dish in Chicago. It's not the deepest I'm told, but still intimidating for a girl raised on Wolfgang Puck. The atmosphere is fun and raucous, not good for an intimate date but perfect for a catchup with a friend. Our waitress was not incredibly attentive, but it may have been because we were clearly deep in conversation and she didn't want to disturb us, which I appreciate. When the pizza came I was pretty sure even my beer and a half wasn't going to stimulate my appetite enough to tackle my portion of it. Indeed, I only got partway through my second slice because my companion mocked my lack of Chicago spirit. The first bite was exquisite. The crust is lovely and the ingredients were well distributed; fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and an ever-so-slightly crispy bottom. Everyone talks about their caramelized crust, but it's worth mentioning again because it truly does distinguish them.The second time I popped in for their lunch special, I was disappointed, particularly considering my agreeable first experience. My main issue was the service. I waited about ten minutes for my waitress to return after giving me a menu, and the restaurant was not busy by any stretch of the imagination. Eventually I asked the girl behind the bar and she ended up serving me for the most part while my waitress walked past me over and over, completely ignoring me. Perhaps she was blind in one eye and I should be kinder, but my guess is she just didn't care much.The pizza was still good, but didn't wow me like the first time. Perhaps it was that the smaller pizzas don't come in the skillet and therefore aren't protected from the elements, or perhaps it was that the atmosphere contributed heavily to my enjoyment. Whatever the case, I was underwhelmed by the lunch special - $5 is a great deal for a personal pizza, but you have to dine in and the presentation leaves something to be desired. Go with a friend and tackle a real pie. And leave some room in the fridge."
"Amazing, unique pizza. Order the deep dish with the carmelized crust. DON'T order delivery, it will show up 2 hours later and cold, this is the only complaint I have."
"This was by far the best pizza in Chicago!  The crust was soft, flaky, & buttery. I was very impressed with my visit here."
"We had two pizzas.  One deep and one extra thin. The deep was delish but the extra thin was the bomb..!  You get what you want for toppings, we all have our own tastes, that's a gimme.  But you look to the crust and its flavor when you've identified a delicious pizza.  It's REAL at Pequod's..!"
"The pizza was great. My favorite in Chicago so far! Service was pretty fast, but we were there around 3pm on a Wednesday. I'll definitely be going back. Thanks Peaquod's!"
"Hands down my favorite Chicago deep dish place! I have dreams about getting this pizza, and regularly harass friends to go there with me."
"Made it back for another try of Pequads and it didn't disappoint.  Last time I went conservative with plain pie, but this time friend wanted to load it up with ham, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms and extra sauce. OMG a flavor explosion is best way to describe it. Sausage and pepperoni in particular were spectacular.  Pepperoni wasn't usual over salted super spicy but on mild smokey side- loved it and I'm not a pepperoni fan usually. Good thing I live nowhere close to this pizza place- I'd really gain unwanted pounds fast."
"I've nearly lost some friends in Chicago for saying that I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish. It seems a little heavy and overdone to me.However, Pequod's brings me close to changing my mind. The crust is everything it's described as being - cheesy, flavourful, and delicious. It complements the pizza, which I at least enjoyed (although it's heavy enough that a slice was definitely enough for me).One slight issue was the length of the wait for the food, which we were warned about, but the hour-long wait was hard.The tiramisu was Americanized - overly sweet, not high quality - I wouldn't recommend it. However, I would recommend the rest of the food!"
I love love love Pequods!  The pizza there is so amazing and the caramelized crust is the best part!  The service has been great every time I have gone there.  There is plenty of seating for big groups and TVs to watch sports.
"Unbelievably good, surprisingly good. I've been trying to come here for quite some time but unfortunately I live 50 miles away.  Today I got my chance and they without a doubt are worth the hype. Lunch in Chicago for under 10 bucks is hard to come by. A quality lunch for under 10 is almost impossible.  I got the lunch special  (4.95) plus extra toppings (they weren't needed). I can't say enough about how good it was so I'll stop. If you like this type of pizza (obviously I do) then this place is for you.  If you want fancy, snobby, weird food then stay away. Old school great food at a fair price. Well done!"
So I was just looking through my old reviews and saw my Pequod's review. Well I have been back many a time since then and it's great!  I think we just got a bad takeout one.  It got cold or whatever.  The place is great if you eat in.  The pizza is ohh so good and crispy.  The staff is nice and parking isn't that hard.  Let me get back to the pizza it' a gem.  Awesome wonderful amazing stuff. Just go eat it.
"Truly one of Chicago's best kept secrets. I am always surprised when friends haven't experiences the magical deliciousness of Pequod's caramelized crust. There is a great lunch special ($4.95 for a 7"" personal pan pizza and a beer/soda) and the toppings here do not mess around. Your pizza will come heaped with whatever you order on it. The appetizers are just so-so but the main event is really the pizza  The only real downside is that public transportation to Pequod's is not the easiest. Luckily I have always been able to find parking or can take the Ashland bus. This pizza, however, is definitely worth whatever distance you have to travel."
"Needed to get that Chicago deep dish fix. After looking up several spots on yelp, decided to venture outside the downtown area. Showed up around 7ish and there was a line outside the building. Always a good sign. Checked in with the hostess and if was approx an hr wait. As we waited, take out orders were a plenty. Another good sign. 2 spots became available at the bar so we took them and our wait was cut shorter. Had the full order of Cesar salad and a small mushroom and pepperoni deep dish pizza plus a couple of local brews. Hit the spot. Great place and good service. Would come back again."
"BEST Chicago deep dish pizza.  Very well known place to any one who lives in Chicago and loves pizza. We have been coming here for years and it was always consistently tasty.   This place is always busy especially when it is their lunch or dinner rush.  We always order ahead on our way there so it doesn't take forever for the food to come out after we order.  Deep dish usually takes about 40 minutes to cook. Calling ahead also guarantees us a seat faster since our food is being made.  Never waited over 5 minutes even if it is a hour and a half wait.  We always order mozzarella sticks to start.  Their marinara dipping sauce has to be one of the best I have ever tried.  Sweet and savory.  We also get a medium deep dish pizza with: extra cheese, sausage, onions, green peppers and half mushroom.  OMG - BEST ever.  Cheese just oozing away.  Mounts of toppings and sweet marinara sauce. Their crust is perfectly cooked and the burnt cheese edges are perfect.   The staff is very friendly, fast and productive.  They are very well managed by the moment you walk in the door.  I will also come here for deep dish pizza no matter what!!!"
"omg. why have i not reviewed this place yet?  this is our go-to for a freaking DELICIOUS stuffed pizza.  definitely the best in the city, which probably means the best in the world.  whoa, that is a bold statement.the crust is phenomenal.  it is crispy yet slightly doughy and soooo flavorful.  the cheese is delicious and the sauce is spot-on.  we almost always order delivery, which is ridiculously yummy, but in-restaurant.. ugh.  i could just die.  it's the cherry on top.  i haven't had their lunch special yet but it is something crazy - your own little pizza and a pop or beer for 5 dollars - something along those lines."
"Weak flur, the food was excellent but service was pretty poor! Most of the ladies were standing talking and after asking for something twice I just decided to get it myself. The ladies behind the barwere pretty cool though and helped me when my server didnt. It was busy, waited two hours for food and it seems management doesn't have to much concern about customer urgency since both places including the sister restaurant had similar service."
"I normally hit up Lou Malnati's when I'm in Chicago, but a friend of mine told me this place was better and I had to check it out. So we tried it out - and although it doesn't knock Lou's out of my top spot, it's pretty darn good pizza.The space inside is tight, especially on a cold night when it's packed full of people to the point you can't move without bumping somebody. They don't take reservations but did allow us to register for priority seating at 8:30 - whatever that means. Also - you can put in your order while you wait, which is nice.We ordered a half cheese/half sausage deep dish. They are famous for their caramelized crust. The chef spreads a thin layer of cheese on the outside of the crust, which causes it to have a charred, burned look - and gives it a chewy texture. I liked the texture, but a few pieces were so chewy that it bordered on tough and I had trouble cutting it with my fork.The sausage was flavorful  - I wished it had more on it because it was so good. The sauce was sweet and tasty as well. Overall - this pizzeria didn't make it into my #1 spot, but it was really good, I'd definitely eat it again, and it just might be #2 on my list."
Probably my favorite deep dish pizza when I visited Chicago! I originally saw this establishment on Food Networks best I've ever had pizza edition and when arriving in Chicago it was a must on my list. So glad I squeezed in some time to try their pie. Had no problem getting a table for 2 on a Sunday around 1:30pm. Pizza takes a little while to make but believe me it's so worth it. Great balance of flavor and oooooozes cheese. Ugh so good!!!
"What the heck is wrong with me? Leaving a review in 2008 for the Thin Crust?  Jeez, how embarrassing. I LOVE Pequod's - always have and always will.  I guess I had one bad experience, but lesson learned, I have never again ordered the thin crust. The thick is the way to go - green olives & pepperoni - you're all set for a delicious time."
"Really good pizza. The pan pizza I got is on par, and maybe even better than (depending on your mood), then Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. Service was pretty good; the hostess was friendly, and the waitress was alright. We went right at opening time so we did not have to wait. But, upon leaving (during noon), there started to see an influx of people. The restaurant itself is relatively big with two stories (maybe even more) considering the area it is in. Speaking of the area, I would recommend taking public transportation (about a five-ten minute walk from the Metra Clybourn stop) and/or walking there if you can. There is street parking and parking lot with an adjoining parking garage across the street. However, I am not sure if the parking lot (with various fees) is just for the stores/gym attached to it. The parking garage is strictly for the movie theater."
"Visiting from Dallas, TX. Everyone says Chicago is known for their deep dish pizza so I have to try some from a local place...& so I have.Got delivery to my hotel, driver said they're not allowed to come to the rooms so I had to go downstairs (I'm calling BS on this one cuz one of the perks of delivery is that you don't have to go anywhere, duh, AND because I delivered pizza in college and that's what we told people when we didn't know our way around a building or were worried about our parking spot...but whatever he was friendly no biggie). I got a personal pan pizza with Italian sausage and it was very good but constructed in the strangest way--Cheese on bottom, flat and round Italian sausage the diameter of the entire pizza on the second layer, and tomato sauce and Parmesan on top. This seemed a little backward to me, and the huge singular piece of Italian sausage is something I've never seen or heard of, but maybe that's how y'all do it here, IDK. Garlic cheese bread was super yummy. Overall great pizza. Wondering if the pizza is really supposed to be prepared upside down though haha."
"Great pizza! I personally enjoyed it more than the other deep dish places in Chicago, the flavor and crust were better."
"Awesome pizza joint and closes late (2am)! The caramelized crust is something I've never tried before and it's amazing. Three of us ordered a large (first time having deep dish) since we just got off a 4 hour plane ride from SF, and was starving since we skipped dinner. We overestimated ourselves. We finished half the pizza, and took home the other half, which had to be at least a pound of food! Great food, great value! I think one slice per person is more than enough. I was stuffed."
"Love their deep dish, their mozz sticks, and garlic bread!Pizza was slightly burnt on the edges, but I love the crispiness.I wish it was a little less saucy and more cheesy.Very clean on the inside and it wasn't busy at all on a Monday night after the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup. I guess everybody else was out partying in the streets..."
I went to Chicago on vacation from Boston and I wanted to experience some authentic deep dish pizza. I tried a couple of the popular chains first (Lou Malnatis and Ginos) and then gave Pequods a try after a recommendation. I thought this was the best of the three. The pizza at Pequods is amazing. I will have dreams of that caramelized crust. The beer selection was decent but could have had some more choices. I loved the casual vibe of the place and the prices were very good for what you get.
"Saw an episode of Top 5 on Food Network which showcased this place. Decided to try it on our recent visit to Chicago, it was really good. We went on a Sunday morning right after it opened and got seated right away. Took about 45 mins for our pizza once ordered. My hubby had the chicken strips appetizer with honey mustard dipping sauce, I wanted to save my appetite for pizza. He said the strips were good but nothing special. For our meal I had the deep dish sausage personal pan with caramelized cheese crust and he ordered a small thin crust with pepperoni, onions and green peppers. I must say mine was awesome, I ate the whole thing. He said his was good and brought a few slices home. The sauce was really good and I liked the crunchy cheese crust. I'm not a deep dish fan but I will say this was the best one I've had. Total ticket with tip was around $43. Nice service and atmosphere, I would eat here again."
"Best pizza in the city!!! Fresh, tasty. Comes out hot right in the pan. Come visit, Especially in the summer. Ambiance is great. Definitely check it out!"
"I recently went on a trip to Chicago and wanted to try some good deep dish pizza. All I can say is that I'm so glad that this was the first place the I tried. It was soooooooo good. I thought the crust was going to be heavy and greasy, but it wasn't and the toppings were delicious. The pizza was so good that I even thought of giving up sunny southern Californian weather to live in Chicago and eat pizza."
"This is the best deep dish pizza I've in Chicago (I've had Lou's, Gino's East, Giordano's, and UNO). The place feels like your typically pizzeria and isn't the most convenient to get to, but it's not extremely touristy and the service is average."
"My boyfriend and I was on a deep dish food adventures in Chcago and we have to say Pequod's Pizzeria have the best deep dish pizza! We got a small pineapple, pepperoni, grounded beef, with extra sauce deep dish pizza. It was def saucy just the way we like it! The ground beef tasted so juicy and fresh."
Amazing pizza!  Slow Service and super hot (temperature wise) inside. Can't believe they charged for birthday cake!  Three reasons why I gave 4 stars instead of 5!
"One day, I got so bored with my life in VA/DC that I drove 13 hrs to Chicago by myself. And when I got there, I had to try the deep dish pizza and found this place with over 1000 reviews. And having lived a long time in NY, I was skeptical about this deep dish pizza...is it really pizza..?..looked more like a pie to me...-_-;;  but whatever it is, it's BETTER than NY pizza lol! There I said it! haha.I got the small with mushroom and spinach. The crust was so crispy~ ;9 I don't usually eat alot, but I finished the 10"" deep dish by myself ^^v Also, the bartender was really nice and cute! lol. I sat at the bar and he was a good conversation partner while I munched away."
"This is seriously my favorite pizza of all time. It's so good. I'm actually waiting for one to be ready for pickup right  now. I always forget to go for their lunch special during the week, but one day I will really do it. Thanks for existing, Pequod's!"
"The reviews are correct, the crust is probably the best I've ever had!  We had a large deep dish...do yourself a favor and only order no more than 3 toppings because they PILE it on!  I made the mistake of getting 8 toppings and it took FOREVER to cook!  Even the plain pepperoni on the table next to us looked full!  If you go on a busy Sat night, be prepared to wait but you can order your pizza ahead so that its cooking and about done when you get your table!  Also their beepers go a long way, we went a bar a few doors down and it buzzed us in 20min vs. the 40min they orginally told us we'd be waiting!  CRUST AMAZING!"
Love Pequods.  Think I'll go there tonight!
"You select the ingredients and it comes out to you perfectly cooked with a crispy,flaky and light crust.  What more can you ask for?  It's consistent every time. Best deep dish in Chicago.  Period.Also, they have a solid beer selection."
"I think this is the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago.  Granted, I am a tourist and not a Chicago-native, but this pizza beats Giordano, Unos, and Gino's East. I love how the crust is thin and crispy..a deep dish pizza without all the bread.Also, the pizza sauce is just plain tasty.How can you go wrong with a pizzeria with a mascot that boasts a Whale wearing a Thong on its head? =)I dream about this pizza...seriously...it was that good."
"Pequods is amazing. Its like, what are you pequods? Are you deep dish? Are you not? Your ambiguity intrigues me and I will continue eating excessive amounts of you. Pequods pizza has a very thick layer of dough which i absolutely LOVE. Its not as cheesy as traditional deep dish but just as yummy and filling. They have some good beers and lots of seating(two floors). I knocked a star off because the place can use an upgrade. It looks like 1994 in there."
"Pequod's was my first experience of authentic Chicago pizza and it was pretty tasty.  Being from NJ, I have a bias towards east coast pizza and Pequod's didn't do anything to change my mind on that debate.  That being said, the sausage ""pizza"" I had was delicious.  The sauce was a little too sweet, but other than that, I really enjoyed everything else.  The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it with exposed brick walls.  If you like the Blackhawks, then this would be a great place to hang out for a game. The is packed with Blackhawks stuff."
"On our recent trip to Chicago, my husband and I took quite the journey to find ourselves some classic, Chicago-style pizza and I am proud to announce that Pequod's did not disappoint. Is it the best deep dish that Chicago has to offer? I have no idea. But I DO know that after Lou Malnati's was surprisingly closed due to renovations (their loss), Pequod's easily picked up where Lou's left off. Thank you very much.We started with an order of garlic bread. Nothing special, but after our long search it tasted quite good. For our pizza, we stuck with a classic cheese deep dish and it was definitely worth the search. It was everything I'd hoped a Chicago-style pizza would be. Deliciously cheesy with a tangy sauce and crispy crust in all the right places. So so good. After our long walk through random neighborhoods with only an iphone to guide us, I was also surprisingly pleased with the ambiance of the place. Super casual and a bit dark inside. Exactly how a Chicago pizzeria should be. The booths were a little dirty and beat up, but in a good, gritty, Chicago-ish way. Perfect for delving into a pan full of cheese. I really would love to come back again soon...if only we weren't so damn far away."
"While I'm a sucker for Art of Pizza, there is just something about a caramelized crust that gets me everytime. This place is neck and neck with Art of Pizza for me. While I generally like Art of Pizza as my go to Chicago Deep Dish pizza place, the pizza at Pequod's is in a league of its own. It's not like regular deep dish. Something happens inside those seasoned pans they make the pizza in that makes it so damn good. It's just as ridiculously good delivered too!"
One of my favorite pizza spots in Chicago. Always a good time and good service. The deep dish is amazing. They have one of the best lunch specials on the planet. Make sure to check out this place when you visit Chicago.
"I was told this place has the best pizza... And now after trying it, I a agree!  It was the best pizza I have ever had!   Expect a long wait to get into this place.  It is worth the wait!!!"
"The place is kind of like a toned down sports bar.  There are TV's showing sports, neon lighted signs advertising various beers, t-shirts for sale at the long bar that extends through most of the 1st floor.  On the day we went it was far from rowdy: there were quite a few couples, a family, etc.We ordered the small deep dish pan with pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms. DELICIOUS!  Really hit the spot.  All the toppings were additional as their default deep dish comes with only cheese.  Each additional topping for a small pan is $1.75 additional. (Price goes up from there for larger pan servings.)The Mostacciolli with roasted garlic herb and olive oil with just okay.  The additional meatballs for $2.75 only gives you two medium sized meatballs.  Free refills on soda.  Some tables the wooden slab that the pizza is put on is in the shape of a whale. CUTE!Small pan is perfect for 2 people of average appetite to share (2 giant men with huge appetites may need more).  Deep dish tastes (at least deep dish from Pequod's) won't taste anywhere near the same leftover so you'll want to try to order only as much as you can finish.  We had leftovers and the next day the juice (not sauce...it really was meat juice/fat or something) from the toppings soaked into the bready crust and made the perfect caramelized crust from the previous day all soggy: blech."
"Pequod's is not a traditional Chicago Deep Dish like Lou Malnati's, but it is quite possibly the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.The sauce: sweet and zesty. The crust: puffy and crispy on the outside, but there's more...Pequod's pan pizza has caramelized (read: burnt) cheese on the outer crust, which is created by laying slices of cheese up against the inside wall of the pan and letting it run down around the outside of the crust as it rises and bakes (there is no ""sprinkling"" involved).This cheesy, crispy outer char-crust is the reason you come here.When ordering, make sure you order the PAN pizza and not the thin crust. The thin, although not bad (I've had better thin crust), does not have this crunchy cheesy goodness on it's outer crust, and you will leave disappointed, like many New Yorkers seem to have already done on Yelp.Keep the number of toppings to a minimum. I recommend only 2 toppings at a time, but I wouldn't go over 3. Don't go overboard or you will lose the greatness of this pizza in all of the toppings. Avoid anchovies at all costs!My fellow Pequod-a-holics and I have come up with a consensus of good combinations; here are a few of our favorites:Pepperoni and Garlic - You really can't go wrong with this one (My personal favorite).Italian Sausage and Pepperoncini (spicy yellow peppers) - for the people who like a little heat.Italian Sausage and ... just about anything - They have great Italian Sausage at Pequod's.Pepperoni / Sausage combo - best of both worlds.Spinach and Garlic - a classic combo (even better with Italian Sausage).The Heartstopper - You could ask for it by name, but they won't know what the heck you're talking about. This is the only exception to the 3 toppings or less rule. Every meat available goes on this pie (Sausage, Ground Beef, Canadian Bacon, Pepperoni), with the optional addition of fresh garlic, and yes, you do run the risk of not getting the full effect of a Pequod pizza, but ... damn, it's good.You can see pics and read my full review at:realdeepdish.com/2010/03…"
"Hands down, the BEST Chicago style pizza you can get.  I've been to the tourist trap places all throughout the Chicago area.  This IS the place to go when you're in Chicago for Chicago style pizza.The quality of the dough and the toppings is amazing.   I just had a sausage and pepperoni and the quality of the meats is surprising for a pizza place.  Too often pizza places cut corners on the toppings to increase profit margins.  Not this place.  My friends and I were joking that we could all just make a meal of the sausage used for the topping, it was that good.A lot of reviewers here on Yelp talk about the ""crust"".  More specifically, it's the crispy edges of the crust.  I've never seen it done anywhere else, but Pequod's ""burns"" the very edges of the pizza and it produces this toasty, cheesy goodness that defies words.  You will definitely find yourself, finding ways to eat the edges, even after your full.My last visit here was in the summer of 2011 and I've been obsessing over their pizza ever since. I guess it's good that I'm from out of town. otherwise, I'd be here every weekend (and a much larger person to boot).If you're in Chicago, it's worth the 15 minute drive up to get some of this iconic pizza."
"Say the words ""Chicago-style deep dish pizza"" and most of us out-of-towners are thinking about Gino's East or Giordano's.  Some are familiar with Lou Malnatti's, which is a fine establishment, and superior to those first two names.  But the money spot is Pequod's Pizzeria.  It's not even a contest.Everything is FRESH and done big.  The crust is caramelized -- you will never eat a better pie crust in all your days.  May I recommend the sausage - great flavor, and hearty.  You won't leave Pequod's hungry.This place is a banging value, too.  Call in your order ahead of time, because it's bound to be packed.  We tried the garlic cheese bread and onion rings, too -- both were phenomenal.Do not leave Chicago without trying Pequod's.  Do it."
I cannot rave about this place enough! Amazing food and staff. Leftovers are even amazing! Try a side of ranch to dip your pizza in. The word is out so be prepared for a wait!
"I love this place.  Great for a laid-back date or bringing out-of-towners for some authentic deep dish.  Staff is friendly, never have to wait for a table, casual atmosphere, and the pizza...AWESOME."
"This place is great! You absolutely cannot beat their lunch special anywhere else. $5 for a personal pie and a beer?! Sign me up.I've only ever been here around lunch time, and there is always plenty of seating to be had. I also seem to get lucky with a parking space right out front a lot of the time.On to the the pizza... I love their caramelized crust. I've seen a few people on here bashing it, but this is really what the pizza is all about. It's pretty thick dough on the bottom which definitely fills you up, but it doesn't dominate the pizza. The cheese and sauce they use taste delicious. I would recommend ordering the pizza with extra cheese since it normally is a bit light on the cheese for my personal preference. I've only tried sausage and pepperoni pizzas, and both toppings are tasty and high quality. The wings are delicious but small. Still, an order is plenty for two people to share.If you are looking for a place to stop in or lunch, I would definitely say this place is worth your time. I can't speak for dinnertime, but it seems like you might have to wait a while for a table at night. Since this place is open late i would love to come by here for some brews and a Blackhawks game. Since it's not in my neighborhood I haven't gotten to do this yet, but I hope I do sometime!Go to Pequod's."
"Delicious deep dish pizza! Had to wait 45 minutes for our table, but well worth the wait!"
Best chicago deep dish...period. Yelp wanted me to write more but I said enough
"I don't know what I was thinking giving Pequods a bad review the first time, but I was not thinking straight when I wrote that review.  I decided to give Pequods another try - ordered a large pan with half sausage as a carryout order and man was it delicious!!!  The sausage was soo good and the caramelized crust was tasty.  Can't wait to go home and devour the leftovers!"
"amazing deep dish, those pans they use create a nice cooked crust.  Quality ingredients also make their pizzas so damn good.Try adding garlic as one of the toppings, you will be amazed.Better ingredients.  Better Pizza.  Pequod's Pizzeria!ps - make reservations here, this place can be packed on weekdays and weekends"
"As a Chicagoan, I grew up on Lou Malnatis, Due's, Gino's East, and even Edwardo's when it was still around. I had only heard about Peaquod's from a friend. On my last trip back home, I went to dinner here. We got a large half sausage half pepperoni deep dish. Couldn't believe how good it was. I've always liked my pizza on the crispier side, so this place seems tailor-made for me. They don't use as much tomato sauce compared to Lou's or Due's, and the meat isn't served as it's own layer either. It was well-balanced and the crust seemed like dessert afterward. Whenever I'm home, I'll be getting my deep dish from Peaquod's. Bonus city points if you remember going to Batter Up on Lincoln just a block over back in the day. The projection screen of the pitcher do his wind-up before the ball came out was a class above all other batting cages. They also had a bizarre basketball court with different shaped backboards, an arcade, and laser tag too."
"I'm not a big deep dish pizza guy. When I think of Chicago style pizza, I don't think deep dish. I think Fox's. I think of south side bars' pizzas, thin crust and cut in squares. But  the crust of a Pequod's pizza... in 30,000 years of eating bread - bread pudding, french toast, elephant ears - the crust of a pequod's pizza might be the best we've done so far"
"When asking around about Chicago Pizza, the two names that came up were Gino's and Lou's.  It wasn't till I talked to some local pizza lovers that I came across this place.  They told me that they hoped that my opinion of Chicago pizza wouldn't be reflected by my experience with Gino's. Well....this was my last meal in Chicago and I have to say that this was one of the most memorable of them all.  We came right when it opened and we took advantage of their lunch special, which included a 7"" one topping pan pizza and beer or coke for $5.   Five.  Dollars.I had my pizza with Sausage, Garlic, and Fresh Tomatoes.  Paid only $1 for the extra toppings.  The garlic added some nice flavor to the sauce and it was the best dollar I spent in Chicago.The sauce was great, the pizza had a great crust with a nice crisp, and the ingredients were very flavorful.  It was a great piece of pie and the best we had in Chicago.  If anyone has tried a better pizza in Chicago, then I would love to hear about it.  But this was clearly the best in our trip to the midwest.   So definitely try Gino's and Lou''s to get your own opinion, but don't be foolish by leaving this out of the discussion if you're looking to try the best pizza of Chicago."
"So for the people that keep calling their pizza deep dish pizza it's not. They serve thin and what's called pan pizza, that's not deep dish.  I love this place. If it's your first time going call ahead, place is always packed.  The Pizza when you order is made fresh takes about 45-50 for a pizza, but it's very worth it. The sauce, the fresh sausage and the caramelized cheese on the edges is what makes this place awesome!"
"Love the original Pequod's in Morton Grove better, but the Clybourn location is good, too.  Salads are generic, but there's nothing quite like the pizza in the well used pan!"
"Ambiance - there's a great feeling when you walk in.  It has that ""local"" feel to it.  It's not extravagant with details or fancy lighting, but it feels comfortable in there. It's not a big place but I think there's more seating upstairs but I wasn't able to confirm. There are TV's available to watch sports and the bar area is nice.The Good - Garlick Cheesy bread is a MUST get. It looks like a a philly bread that's split in half and it has their marinara sauce, great amount of garlic, and cheese.  You HAVE to try these!! We had a medium size pan pizza with 2 ingredients and it was reasonably priced. Definitely ask your server what their recommendations are as far how big you want your pizza to be because we didn't listen (and thinking we're hungrier than we actually were) and got the medium, instead of recommended small for me, my husband and a baby.  Service is great and the quality of food is great! I like that they melt mozzarella to their crust that makes that crunchy crust. their home made marinara sauce is really good too!The Bad - I can't say any bad things about this place. Maybe except the bathroom is not all that clean. I didn't think they were going to be baby friendly but they were accommodating and even spent a couple minutes to play with my child.The Bottom Line - If you're interested in a new way of pizza, try this out! I have heard many great things about this place and it definitely lived up the hype.  The price is reasonable, friendly service, and great pizza!"
"This is deep dish, not stuffed, so keep in mind you'll be getting more bread and less cheese. I went ahead and ordered mine with extra cheese and sauce. While I have a go-to for deep dish, it's not something I typically seek out. Pequods just changed that. They really nailed it. While it's not quite as good reheated, I found myself eating some before bed -and I never do that. The restaurant itself is small and seems more like a bar. The service is a bit slow and forced me to swig off my flask, which no one noticed, for ten minutes before someone got around to us. They have Three Floyds on draft, on rotation, which I immediately ordered hoping for that zombie dust. No such luck but the Scottish ale was decent and complemented my rum very well, which I continued to drink at the table. I was pretty hammered by the time the pizza arrived, but I can assure you it's the  best in its class. Their signature carmelized crust lives up to the hype. I could've eaten a plate of that and been happy, and next time, I just might. Good job Pequod."
Can't say enough good things about this place. It's pizza but it's pretty much perfect. It's deep dish and you definitely don't need to eat more than one slice but you will. DO IT.
"My favorite pizza place in Chicago. The crust is burned just a touch. The sauce is delicious. Consistent, every time."
"I knew before coming here that this pizzeria would steal away my heart. Once I saw all the photos of the burnt cheese edges, I knew this was the place for me. And the moment I bit into my slice of pizza, I was proven correct! I've only been to two other pizza places in Chicago but I'm going to take a leap of faith and say that this is the BEST pizza in Chicago. There is no way it can get better than Pequod's."
"Simply put, the best deep dish pizza I have ever tasted.The toppings, the cheese, and the sauce are all incredibly good. What really sets Pequods apart from the smorgasbord of Chicago deep dish is the crust. Chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Perfection.It is worth noting that they have the best lunch special I have ever seen in Chicago. $4.95 (!!!) for a single serving pizza - which is more than enough for lunch - and a beer or soda. It takes around a half hour for the pizza to cook, so keep that in mind. If you want the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, GO TO PEQUODS."
Great deep dish pizza with an awesome crust! This place is a true sleeper probably because it's not a huge chain. I like how they deliver late night as well.In my opinion Pequods and Lou Malnatis have the best Chicago Deep Dish which means they have the best Deep Dish in the world.If you haven't tried out Peqouds quit cheating yourself.
As far as deep dish it is the best in the city. Caramelized crust is amazing.:-)
"A friend recommended Pequod's to me when I put a plea out on facebook for the best pizza in Chicago.  Fun place, tasty pizza, I loved their ""caramelized crust"" that everyone raves about.  I would more describe it as, burnt in a good way.  I think we got some sort of supreme with veggies and meat.  They put a good amount of toppings on, which I love, I'm a toppings girl.  The pizza was filling, the salad was plain and simple and just what I like with my pizza.  We were eating pizza leftovers for days, worth it."
"When my fiance and I first started dating, we realized that we very strongly disagreed on the best pizza in the city. We decided on a ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza Challenge."" My favorite was Lou Malnati's, and my fiance's was Pequod's. We went to both pizzerias and compared our sausage pizzas. The result: Pequod's is hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. In fact - my fiance and I are having our Rehearsal Dinner at Pequod's next May. We were able to rent out the back room, and for a VERY affordable price, have all you can eat pizza and beer/pop for about 50 guests.Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago, hands down. The crust is carmelized which sets it apart from the competition. The sauce and cheese is fantastic as well. I've had just about every combination of pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, veggie, extra cheese), and I've never been let down. Pequod's also has a decent beer selection and for a good price. The appetizers are good as well (mozzarella sticks!), but I highly recommend not ordering any since the pizza is so good and worth the wait. Pequod's also has carry out and delivery.The atmosphere is very casual and a great place for families, date night, or a night out with a few friends. The wait can get long, but you can put your pizza order in while you wait. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations, especially on a Friday/Saturday night. The service is great - everyone there has a smile on their face even when it is crazy busy. It truly is a great experience with the best deep dish pizza in Chicago."
Ive been coming to Pequod's since my college years and always recommend them to visitors or friends who are looking for an authentic local pizza experience. Their lunch special is great - a personal pan with 1 topping and a beer for under $5. That is how you keep customers happy and coming back.I have always been pleased with the friendly service. Definitely go here!
The pan pizza is the best in the city... But the thin is good also.......we eat here once a week  today whoever made my pizza decides that half sausage half pepperoni meant half a pound of sausage half a pound of pepperoni... It totally ruined the balance of the pizza ..sad. Had to peel off most of the meat.In many years this has happened twice...
"Takes a long time to get seated sometimes, but it's worth the wait. Best pizza in Chicago."
"Mmmmm, Pequod's, you never seem to fail me.The best deep dish pizza in Chicago you'll find. A bold and ballsy statement to make, I know, but there is no other place I'd turn to (except maybe Burt's Place in Morton Grove) for true, fresh, and delicious Chicago deep dish pizza.I came here last night for a work outing with nine other people, and Pequod's was extremely accommodating and attentive to our party. Our drinks were never empty and they were quick to take our order and brought the food out promptly after the excruciatingly long wait of 45 minutes for the pizza to bake.The pizza:The pizza here is always consistent and I've never experienced any flukes with their pizza. What makes this pizza so much better than Lou's, Unos, or Giordanos is their caramelized crust. Sure, it sounds weird, but trust me, it's what seals the deal with this pizza. It'll turn any non-crust eater into a believer.They offer a range of different toppings and you can build your own creations. Last night we went with one sausage, one pepperoni, and one ""supreme"" that had mushrooms, peppers, onions, sausage, pepperoni, and black olives. The supreme pizza was annihilated in a matter of minutes, which I chalked up to be due to the extremely fresh and plentiful ingredients that they pile on. I feel that it's worth mentioning that their sausage here isn't the disgusting ""sausage patty"" that lines the pizza, much like what they do at other pizza places. It's real sausage that is in silver dollar sized pieces sprinkled over the pizza.The atmosphere:Kind of loud and typical of any pizza joint. They have two floors so the restaurant is a lot bigger than it appears from the street.The service:They were attentive and fast, as I previously mentioned, but they weren't all that friendly. If anything there is room for improvement here.If you haven't been to Pequods, it's definitely worth checking out to get a taste of their unique take on the crust. Also, it's rarely ever ""packed"" and you won't face a 1-3 hour wait like many of the other pizza places in town. Once you try this, I guarantee you won't be going back to Unos/Due/Lous anytime soon."
"I love this place. A buddy of mine recommended this place and was completely worth it.Showed up about 9 o'clock and the place was packed, was originally given an hour wait for a table and ended up getting a place sitting at the bar shorty after, which was just as good as having a table for us. Bartenders and wait staff were super friendly and accommodating. Never took long to get new drinks and our water cups were always kept full, which is a huge plus in my book. *Note when we left around 11 this place was maybe half full, so later you come the better.Ordered the cheesy bread which was good, but nothing to write home about. Might recommend them to start serving it with some nacho cheese sauce.However the deep dish pizza here was some of the best pizza I've had in awhile, makes my top 5 list of pizza places. Ended up with a sausage and mushroom pizza and a spinach and mushroom pizza, both were great. Starting with the fresh ingredients, perfect amount of sauce and then the crust, whatever they are doing, they are doing right. Only issue was on one of the pizzas they had a lot of mushrooms all clumped together, but nothing to really complain about.Being a Blackhawks bar, really want to make it in for a game next time I visit. Could see this place getting packed and a great place to watch it with all their tv's and memorabilia. Note I'd definitely be showing up early to either get a table or a good spot at the bar.Only thing that was a little strange that you could see the bartenders routinely going on smoke breaks and the cashier was wearing a bull ring. I guess whatever floats your boat, but I think hurts the professional feel of the place, but guess everybody has to have a little flare."
"We made a reservation and still waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  The place was packed and I only saw 1 bartender at the bar.  Don't expect your server to have endless conversations or for them them check in with you very often. They are too busy for that.  The pizza was great, we had deep dish with numerous toppings.   One thing I like is a good pizza to reheat for leftovers.  Unfortunately, this pizza just isn't as good reheated.  So, that's really my only major complaint."
"We came here about two weeks ago after I ran the Chicago Half Marathon. What better way to celebrate running 13.1 miles than by stuffing your face with deep dish pizza!!!We started off with the onion rings. They were huge and very good when dipped in the accompanying barbecue sauce.We ordered the small deep dish pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The pepperoni was nicely toasted and tasted great on the pizza. The pizza had just the right amount of cheese and the crust was very good. The top of the crust is slightly burnt and gives a good taste. This was definitely the best deep dish pizza that I have had in a long time. After only two slices I was totally full.The service was decent, even though they were busy. Food Network was there recording people eating in the restaurant for an upcoming episode. I doubt I will get on t.v., but that was still pretty cool.If you want good pizza, look no further than Pequod's.  We will definitely be back."
"I'm not one who would typically opt for deep dish pizza, but at Pequod's, it is an absolute MUST. We got there pretty early on a Saturday night, around 5:45, so we had no trouble getting seated, and it was just 2 of us, so they sat us in a little booth against the wall.Took our drink order and they had one of my favorite IPAs (half acre daisy cutter), so I was happy as a clam. Not to mention I was absolutely famished, so I could not wait for our pizza to arrive.And arrive it did...eventually. Like 1.5 hours later. Basically, the story goes that they accidentally served our pizza to another table. They actually cut it up and serve the pizza on plates, so I guess the other table did not realize it was the wrong pizza until it was served up, at which point they could not give it to us. So, they said they would give us 50% off of our pizza...gee, thanks? 50% off of a $10 pizza? Wow, so glad we saved $5. Well, at least that's what was going through my head. BUT, thank god they redeemed themselves and gave us 50% off the small price pizza but actually gave us a large. Which was, in my opinion, a much better deal and much more worthy of the inconvenience we had to sit through. Because....We were on our way to see Hunger Games and I absolutely hate being late to movies. They made it work though and it was all good. They even stored our left overs for us so we could go to the movies and then pick it up on our way home.I subtracted a star because of the wait, but they made up for it, and I would not hesitate to come back here. Totally a splurge since I think 1 slice has got to be like 1,000 calories, but worth it every once in a blue moon :)"
"This place is great. I haven't tried every pizza place in Chicago, but this is what I tell people is the best. It feels authentic and purely Chicago. Highly recommended of you want. Down to earth pizza parlor / bar that does excellent deep dish"
"After 1,000+ reviews, I fear my review will fail to add any real value.  However, I am compelled, yes COMPELLED, to offer my two cents.Three friends and I recently decided to grab dinner on a Friday, and one recommended this place.  I was the one that called them up to make a reservation.  Unfortunately, the server had no record of our reservation when we got there (damn you Smart phone, you provided me the wrong phone number).  No problem, there was a nice corner for us to hang out and enjoy a few drinks of The Green Line.  Props for supporting a local brewery.Now, the pizza... I simply cannot describe, in words, how much I enjoyed it.  My expectations were rather low since I am not a fan of traditional deep-dish pizza.  One bite in and my expectations were surpassed.  Three slices later and I became the latest Pequod super-fan.  I now find that it is my duty to introduce everyone I know to Pequod's Pizzeria."
"Okay, admittedly I love pizza. You have to have some pretty crappy pizza for me to write a terrible review. Some might say that I'm a bit of a pizza connoisseur, others might say I'm merely a patron. Nonetheless, Peqoud's is TRUE CHICAGO pizza. I feel like a real Chicago native when I'm in this lovely establishment. It's super divey, but not in a creepy, dusty way. It's simply dark enough and loud enough to feel like you're apart of something bigger than yourself. That thing that is bigger is an overwhelming pizza experience. The crust is perfectly caramelized, and the sauce is a lovely combination of tangy and sweet. I'm just saying, you have to go to this pizza place if you want to feel apart of Chicago. DA BEARS."
"I moved to Chicago from Canada a few months ago and a lot of my friends have been visiting the last couple months (the summer months... not the winter months, they don't even know my name during the winter months). Whenever one of them visits, they request 'the best deep dish' in Chicago. I've tried about 15 different pizza places since i've been here and although a lot are close, and ALWAYS delicious; Uno, Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, I have to say, they all lose their shit over Pequod's. The toppings are plentiful and always taste fresh, the tomato sauce is signature and their crust is unlike anything i've had, it's caramelized and impossible not to finish (I usually never finish the crust).* During Peak hours, there's about an hour wait, The Drinking Bird next door to Pequod's has great cocktails!"
"was REALLLLY close to 5-star status here, but 2 things prevented me from giving into my baser pizza-craving instincts:1. this place gets PACKED. like, really packed, even for Chicago. 2 hour waits on weekend nights are not out of the question.2. These guys crank out 'zas in volume, which means sometimes they make a mistake or two.  Unfortunately, this happened last time i was there - waited 1.5 hrs to get in, then 40 mins for pizza, only to have the wrong order come out.  She was great and put in an individual pizza for free to make up for it, but was kind of a bummer.PRO TIP: if you're waiting for a table for a while, head next door to the Drinkingbird.  Great little place to get a beer or a craft cocktail while you're waiting, and the buzzer Pequod's gives you will still work at that range.now let's get to the good stuff:  the pizza is truly phenomenal. I used to be a dead-to-rights Giordano's guy, having grown up south of Chicago.  This is different - not stuffed pizza like Giordano's, not really ""deep dish"" like Gino's east - more of a true ""pan pizza"" a la Lou Malnatis. However i much prefer Pequod's to LM's because of the crush and the way the cheese bakes in the pan.  Sausage lovers - welcome to paradise.  This sausage - even by chicago standards - is the best i've had."
My favorite pizza in Chicago. Was great living around the corner. One of the things i've missed the most after moving away...
"This place has changed my life forever! Their deep dish with their house ranch = heaven! FAT GIRL HEAVEN. I've had their pizza with meatballs as well, also divine!"
Definitely in my top 3 pizza joints in the city. Love the deep pan pizza but it's the crust that really makes it so special.
"Service is whatever, but this deep dish is my new fave. So goooooooooood. I like lots of sauce that is tangy and slightly sweet and this fits the bill. I liked the crispy sort-of burnt cheese on the outside of the crust, just...so satisfying.P.S. Born and raised Chicagoan. Lou's is garbage. Thhhbt."
We come here for our birthdays every year!! The deep dish cheese with giardineras is by farrrr our favorite! That Caramelized crust.... Yummmmmmmm!!
"Came in today and it was packed.  The wait was an hour but I wasn't surprised, I came another time and the wait was the same time. Once seated, our server was nice but forgot about our appetizer. Our pizza was served and unfortunately over cooked, the crust and even the bottom was black. It was not like the last time, and at one point we felt like it was a mistake to come back but the manager saved our visit. He was polite and understanding when we explained our disappointment of the burnt pizza (didn't even mention the server's mistake). He quickly brought us a new pizza that was excellent and reminded us why we came back. Pizza was amazing, one of the best. Thanks to the manager we will be back. Thank you for your professionalism and The great service."
"a GOLD standard in Chicago, perhaps nation(!), hence featured on food networks or shows.    Prefer various meat deep dishes.    The caramelized cheese crust is what will bring you back again, and again, and again.   (Can someone just invent and sell that?)Sometimes carryout orders get mixed up.   They are very accomodative"
"I told my friends I wanted a deep dish pizza when I went to visit them in Chicago and this is where they took me. The first attempt was a Friday night around 9:30, BAD IDEA this place had a line out the door. We stopped by for a late lunch the next day and we had a sort wait to be seated. The pizza is really good and so is the service."
Pizza matters in Chicago and this place has Straight up Good Pizza! A nice relaxed atmosphere to kick back with friends and relax.
"When I get back to Town this is one stop I would definetly take.  Had lunch here a few times, weekends and most nights gets packed. Had the Personal Pan Pizza with a beer, orderd a 2nd pan just for the beer! Great tasting pizza love the crust..."
"I went on a night that was not crowded.  We had the deep dish and it was good.  I had visited to their other location for lunch, in my opinion, this pizza here in Chicago tasted better than their other location.  Service was good, I enjoyed my time here with my friend."
"As a huge pizza fan, it is hard for me to give any one pizza place 5 stars...but Pequod's definitely deserves it.  The caramelized crust is unlike any other Chicago deep dish and the sauce and toppings are extremely fresh.  But the best part of Pequod's is their lunch special.  $4.95 for a 7"" one topping deep dish pizza and a draft beer or pop.  The pizza is hearty so a 7"" is definitely enough for even big eaters, but I wouldn't expect to have leftovers!On rare occasions the wait can be longer than expected for pizza, but it is well worth it!"
Pequod's is a great alternative to Lou Manalti's. The crusted cheese was great. I loved the atmosphere. Would definitely come back!
"Deep dish, burnt crust.  Yummy and crunchy.  Light, short pizza dough, almost like pastry."
"Pequod's is my favorite deep dish spot in Chicago. The pizzas are famous for having a brunt cheese crust, which sets it apart from most other spots in the city. It's open till really late (2AM), so it's the perfect spot to end the night, though the portions are enormous."
"So many people who love Chicago deep dish told me I HAD to try something more authentic than Giordano's or Lou Malnati's... this is the place that was recommended to me.I enjoyed this pizza. The place was small and the service was decent. My friend and I went for the lunch special which is an individual pizza with one topping and a soda or a bud light. It was a great deal! The carmelized crust was good, my friend loved it a lot more than I did. For me, having something slightly sweet with my pizza threw me off. All in all it's a great local place if you want some authentic Chicago style deep dish."
"The wait is long, and the interior is crowded and noisy, but this is the one deep-dish in Chicago that I like. Can't wait to go back at an off-time (rather than a Saturday night).The crust is carmelized. The toppings are great. The sauce is great. Get in my mouth, Pequod's."
"Although the cheese slices were completely bland and the crust was super soggy for being a thin crust, this review was is solely on the deep dish and service. I've tried deep dish all around the city : giodanos, Lou M, UNOs, etc.. This is by far the best deep dish my husband and I have ever had. This was our second attempt to try this place out. The first time was too long of a wait. We went early the second time around and were seated right away. We order both, a full deep dish and thin slices while we waited. The slices were horrible, so we couldn't figure out why this place was so packed all the time and quite honestly, were not too excited to get our pizza... But boy  were we wrong. We ordered just pepperoni and it was amazing. The taste of the pepperoni, the right amount of cheese, sauce wasn't chunky, and the crust was to die for. Also the waitress was very nice. Definitely a come again place!"
"I just moved back to Chicago. I've been to Pequod's three times this month, and it needs to stop. The pizza is amazing. My favorite is the ground beef topping. Lunch special is a 7 inch pizza and a drink for $5...can't beat that. But, can't we have a beer instead of pop?"
"Some locals wanted to show us real Chicago pizza so we went here.  It did not disappoint.  The pizza was great, the atmosphere was nice.  Great job!"
"I'd never had real Chicago-style pizza before, so I was determined when I finally stepped foot for the first time in the Windy City. Some laborious Yelp research indicated to me that Pequod's has the best in town, so it was off to Pequod's we went.I almost wish I didn't experience this, because now I'm a full-fledged addict and, of course, can't find anything that matches it at home in San Francisco. Their menu said something about never cleaning the grease off their cast iron skillets, so the crust crisps perfectly and caramelizes the cheese in this way that just makes you want to cry. I don't know how it works... black skillet magic?We stuffed our pizza with hella meat toppings like real Chicagoans (who don't say hella) and I think I passed out in a food coma at like 9pm that night. Party animal!"
Pequods is my favorite deep dish pizza place in the city! I recommend it to all visitors and consider it the finest comfort food around. Does it get better than carmelized crust? I think not.
"Requods is the best!  The food, service and experience are just great.  First and most importantly the pizza is deep, caramelized and flavorful.  It's a little different from other Chicago deep dish pizzas but I'm telling you it's a great variation.  Appetizer s are all good.Service is always friendly and attentive.  Lots of hotties working here.  I like the atmosphere.  Standard pizza joint I guess but that works great for me.  Good bar and lots of TVs.  Sports always on.The owner is a hockey nut.  Hawks are always on.  He is the kind of guy that will sit down with you and make friends and in a short time it feels like you have been coming here for years.Have you figured out what that thing is on the fish logo.  Some of the wait staff might not know the whole story but we finally got it from our friend.  You'll know you got the true story when you can't stop laughing.  It's a thong and I'll say no more.  You know it had to be something if they put it on their logo.  Get the story from them."
"We love the pizza by the slice. Nice, crispy thin crust, with fresh toppings.  Great for the family so everyone can get the exact topping they want on their piece. Can be very crowded on weekend evenings!"
"Very busy and a bit of a wait after we ordered. Well worth the wait. Ingredients were fresh, staff was polite and I even got a rose for Valentine's Day!"
I've always heard great things but never had a chance to eat here til now.  Their pizza was great!!!  The service was a little slow but we were in no rush so it was ok.  I highly recommend going!
"I get the Pequod's love. It's not just the pie, which has plenty to recommend it; it's the whole experience. You walk in the door and you know you're in a pizza joint. It's kinda dark, it's kinda noisy, the tables are kinda jammed together. And it *smells* like pizza. Walking in the door takes me back to the places I used to frequent in the 70s, like the old My Pie in Rogers Park. Back before pizza became respectable.Then there's the crust. Is it caramelized or is it burnt? They call it caramelized, and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Because whatever it is, it's freakin' delicious. You get the same thing in an upscale restaurant, and they call it ""parmesan lace."" It's baked cheese, and it's terrific.The crust is pretty thick, as you would expect from pan pizza, and the toppings are plentiful, if a little erratic. Which is to say, slice one, where's the pepperoni?; slice two, loaded with it. The sauce was nothing special, but everything worked together to create a fine pie.Service was quick and friendly. The best part: they asked if we wanted to put in our order right away, before they had a table for us, so the pizza could get started. Nice touch. But they didn't rush us out at the end. I'm still at 4 stars, but I get why people give it 5."
"As a general rule, I judge a neighborhood by the accessibility to good pizza.  Months ago, when I rediscovered Pequod's, I was relieved with my decision to buy my first home in this area.  Phew!I love the thin crust pizza with its perfect combination of sauce and toppings.  Plus, I LOVE the fat, buttery crust!This place gets REALLY busy.  If you are starving and want to sit right away, your chances are pretty good before 6:30pm.I will definitely be back to try the deep dish.  Stay tuned!"
"I have been here probably 15 times, and every time the pizza is EXCELLENT. The cheese particles in the crust is really what makes it! Hands down, this is my favorite pizza I've ever had -- and I have lived in Chicagoland my entire life.Last, but not least, they deliver to my home in the Loop! You really can't ask for more."
"I asked the waitress if the logo is a whale with a thong on it's head.  She said yes.Other than the great logo, this place has great pizzas.  I don't know if they are the best, but Pequod's is really good!"
Hands down best deep dish in Chicago. Gets pretty crowded but the staff is super efficient!
"Can't go wrong with Pequod's, always worth the wait. The only place I go for pizza when I get to pick of course."
"One of the best deep dish places in Chicago. Went here on a Chicago Pizza Tour, hadn't even heard of it much before the tour, or I guess I hadn't noticed hearing about it. After knowing about it I seemed to hear it all the time. Great quality deep dish with a kinda burnt crispy crust that's awesome...now I order it all the time for delivery."
"A friend of mine recommended this place, and eventually a group of us went to give it a try. HOLY MOLY! This is the most delicious pizza I've had in Chicago, or anywhere else for that matter. Seriously: Best. Pizza. Ever. Not a thing I would change.The service was prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable if not particularly engaging. It's comfortable enough that we hung out well past the end of the meal.Definitely my favorite pizza place. Can't wait to go back."
"This review is long over due. This place has the BEST deep dish in Chicago. Seriously. The edges are crispy caramelized cheese, the dough light, and the sauce and topping are phenomenal. They have decent beer on tap - Half Acre and Lagunitas. The place fills up quickly and often times there is a wait. They deliver though only to a certain area. Check their website for the delivery zone. We've eaten in twice and picked up once. Every time, we were not disappointed. Just go and try it. You won't be either."
"Got a pan pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and onions (salivating yet?). The personal size was generous and hefty, pretty delicious. Had the deep-fried mushrooms while waiting, which were just okay--probably didn't need them, in hindsight. Great service. Oh, and Pequod's is better than Malnati's. Just sayin'."
"I've ordered over 100 pizzas from this place for my classes over the past 17 years, the students love it!"
100% The best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Be prepared for a 2 hour + wait on a Friday or Saturday night though. I bring all of my guests here who want a Chicago Pizza experience. You can drink at the Drinkingbird next door while you wait.
"Pequod's, you've done it again!My friend Amanda and I grabbed 12 of our friends last night for a birthday dinner.  We originally had a reservation for 10 but with some late additions we were hoping they could accommodate.  Because of the large size of our party they moved us to the upstairs of the restaurant which had a few other large parties.The other parties of about 10-12 people ordered 3 large pizzas and people nibbled on them.  Our group of fatties ordered 6 pizzas; some ordered their own 10"" pizzas, and some groups of 2 split larges.  I'm sure the waitress thought we were nuts but I kept confirming that we only ordered this much just so we could have leftovers ;)  Even though she had to maneuver in many ways to get the pizzas on our tables and serve us each individually our first slice, she did it and gracefully.  Everyone left full and happy and thoroughly enjoyed the food.  Thanks to the staff for making our friend birthday dinner a big hit!"
"Wow, where do I start. My fiancé is from Chicago so a big fan of deep dish, I however am, err was not. I love me some thin crispy crust pizza, and he has tried many places in order to get me to fall in love with deep dish. no love for me, until.....Pequods. My life will never be her same. Pequods deep dish is not too saucy, and very cheesy. The cheese is baked to a crispy brown and carmelized on top, not too much bread. They have the best balance of ingredients that will make your mouth water until the last bite. I can't go here anymore, it just isn't a healthy relationship for me to have...but so hard to resist.Get here now. There may be a wait, and it's worth it."
This was probably one of the best deep dish pizza's I have ever had! We called ahead to get priority seating and didn't have to wait long when we arrived. The waitress was upfront and told us it would be about a hour for our pizza. Well worth it though!
"Pequod's Pizza is the best pizza.  I have never gone and left disappointed. There is usually a pretty decent wait but it is well worth it.  Go to the bar and grab a beer if you have to.  we never wait more than 20 minutes.  We love the sausage and hot pepper pizza, the crust steals my heart everytime!  The deep dish is not your typical standard, its so much more!"
"O-M-G Yelp, check out that deep dish! It is sooooo tasty! My neighbor referred it to me, and there is no turning back. I like Pequod's Pizza and I cannot deny. (Are you awake now?) In an elevator of our building, we smelled and learned about Pequod's Pizza. The neighbor said, ""You have to try it. It's one of the best."" And three hours later as I was enjoying a deep dish slice, I had to agree. . .So I had a second slice. I think my deep dish craving is satisfied. . .for now. I have had three deep dish pizzas in Chicago and this is by far my favorite. I even convinced my boyfriend, a Giordano's fan, to cross over to Pequod's. He said, ""I never thought I like a deep dish more than Giordano's and now, I do!"" What are you waiting for? Call Pequod's Pizza now!"
"The décor is bordering on the ""no frills"" side of nothing too fancy. That said cut a place some slack it's a pizza joint. We were a bit disappointed at the lack of seating or waiting room for an advertised wait of nearly 30 minutes, but we lucked out and quickly got to sit at our table upstairs after navigating the scary dark stairs leading to a somewhat cozy dining room brimming with people.We ordered a beer and a frighteningly overpriced glass of red wine and set about looking at appetizers. We finally settled on the ""Pequod's Salad"" and some hot wings. For our pizza, we opted to go with beef, onions, and pepperoni. Our salad was about what you expect from a salad at a pizza place, they had a few pieces of shaved provolone, some chunks of cured meat, onions, and some crisp if not tasteless iceberg lettuce, the wings were devoured in no seconds flat and tasted like pretty much all hot wings, decently spicy, hot, tangy, slightly crispy...in other words, I liked em.Our Pizza was slow in getting there but once there was piping hot and pretty good. Having few points of comparison, I would say that the mozzarella cheese was pretty good if maybe not layered on as thick as I would have liked. The sauce was not very spicy, a little bit sweet but had some good herbal flavor to it. The crust was crispy throughout and the dough was buttery and satisfying.Speaking of the crust, the main issue many people have with Pequod's is the outer edge of the crust. In the baking process, the cooks stuff the edges of the pan with cheese to create a slightly burnt ring of cheese on the crust. This happens to also be what many people, your writer included, really loved the most about this pizza. Fortunately for us, my better half was not a huge fan of it and so I got to eat her pizza crust...:) match made in heaven.:)The service was not overly enthusiastic to get us out despite still having a nearly hour long wait to eat. Our server was polite, prompt, and appropriately cheerful for slinging pizzas.  In conclusion, the décor was nothing to boast about, seating was tight, and price point a bit too high for what we got (seriously 10 bucks for a glass of house wine?), but the service was good and the Pizza was pretty good and that counts for a lot. The Pizza really could have used spicier sauce and a bit more cheese but that burnt cheese crust was something everyone should try at least once if they live here or are nearby enough to make a stop.Not that I have had a lot of Deep Dish but so far this one slightly edges out the others (sorry Uno's your dough was still raw), and that earns it the best grade to date.  Overall: B"
"There's not more I could say then what has already been said. The caramelized cheese is amazing and everything there tastes like heaven. Too bad you have to wait an hour before being able to sit down, but its worth the wait!"
"Ordered a thin crust pizza and a deep dish pizza. The deep dish was just sausage and it was phenomenal. The dough with the caramelized cheese on the crust was the best part. The thin crust pizza was sausage, onion and green peeper.  This pizza was under cooked and topping were sliding off.  The thin crust was average at best and we would give it 2 stars.  If going here order the deep dish and don't waste your time with the thin crust."
Was honestly not much of a deep dish fan until I had Pequod's. Thin crust is also a solid option. It can get crowded quickly in there but the pizza is certainly worth it. I'd recommend the Italian beef on a deep dish pizza
"My favorite in the city! Be prepared to wait a little while, particularly on busy nights, but it's worth it!"
"As a Chicagoan, I was seriously missing out what Pequod's has to offer when it comes to Chicago Deep Dish Pizza! Came here for a date during Blackhawks season (not sure if that was a good idea) and they happen to be playing at the same time (Go Hawks!) This place was a serious deep dish pizza spot mixed with a sports bar. If you lived in Chicago, you probably have had Lou Malnati's Pizzeria and Giordano's Pizza which are both GREAT traditional Chicago deep dish pizza however Pequod's Pizza takes it to another level with a caramelized deep dish pizza crust. Do NOT let that crust scare you. The burnt cheese caramelized crust is amazing! Let's not forget about the rest of the pizza! They build their deep dish pizza just as good as Lou Malnati's Pizza and Giordano's Pizza. A small deep dish pizza comes out to be 4 slices of heaven and just right for two people. Throw down on some local beer and your meal will be perfect! The original location is in Morton Grove which still exist today. It is also a smaller place but not as busy as the Chicago location. Wait times at the Chicago location can get up to 2 hours specially when there is a game playing. They do not take reservations but BEST TIP is to call ahead and put your name on the waiting list. The service was great and they were on top of everything even when they were busy with a wait at 2+ hours. Great vibe in the place especially when there is a game on. You cannot even tell they had a fire in the place at one point (January 2006) which they shut down for six months to rebuild. Be glad they did rebuild because it is amazing pizza that would be missed. I would bring everyone here including folks from out of town (which I have!) Small groups might be good but large groups might be difficult. It might be a little rowdy to come here on a date during a game but it would be worth it if they are into Chicago teams. Impress them by calling ahead and passing up the line when you get there! If you had to wait, it is totally worth it. And if you cared, the Hawks won the same night it was my first time I had Pequod's Pizza!Food - 5Décor - 5Service - 5"
"Amazing food. The pizza is easily the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. The fried cheese and marinara sauce was top notch as well. The waitresses could give patrons more attention though. Ours checked on us only once, but she was quick about filling our requests.The decor is about what you'd expect for a local sports bar turned restaurant. I recommend seating upstairs as it's more family friendly and less ""bar""."
Best deep dish in Chicago. Get extra sauce.
"Simply the best pizza I've ever had. Believe the hype about the caramelized crust. Pequod's pizza is the kind of experience that can turn a horrible, life-crushing day into one that you'll want to remember fondly. Just the right combination of sauce, cheese, and burnt bits to make all of your problems melt away for a few moments."
"I have mixed feelings about Pequod's to be honest. I, in no way, shape or form think this is the best deep dish Pizza in Chicago. I'll start my review off with what I liked first though.Every square inch of my Pizza was crammed with toppings. More often than not, when it comes to Pizza toppings, your left wondering where the hell are all the toppings I payed for. Fortunately at Pequod's this is not the case. The Pizza was well done and you could tell everything was pretty fresh. The Pizza held together well and had a great balance of toppings, sauce and crust.The crust was great right up until the burnt portion of it. I'm sorry but i'm not a fan of burnt crust or caramelized cheese. The sauce really wasn't as flavorful as I would like. Those were my two biggest draw backs to an otherwise great Pizza."
"This is Chicago deep dish. The best pizza in Chicago, with a great atmosphere and a fun, attentive staff. This is the place you want to go for your taste of Chicago deep dish."
"Within minutes of landing from NYC we had our target set for Chicago does best, Deep Dish Pizza. We had picked this place to branch out from the more ubiquitous spots that will remain nameless. Seated immediately and served with a smile we ordered up our pizza selection.  We got a small with sausage and 1/2 mushroom.  The pizza came out roughly 15 minutes later piping hot and was placed on the wood scrap trivet adorned on every table.  The server dished up each of us a slice.  The ""caramelized"" cheese around the edges gave it a unique texture but no burnt taste.  The pizza was a step above all the other deep dish pie I have ever tried in this fair city. The mushrooms made it a little messier but well worth it.  We even had a slice left between the two of us.  So I am snacking on it now during this review.  So glad to have tried this place.  The service was super friendly and very attentive.  They have a large selection of beers and a bunch of tvs on both floors.  So you can catch sports while dining if you need that sort of thing.  Yeah Pequod's!  Looking forward to maybe another round before I leave this great city of culinary delights."
"This is the best pizza I've ever had.  I took a picture of it, and I show that picture to strangers I meet on my travels.  Not like, ""Oh those are your kids?  Let me show you a picture of my deep dish.""  More like, ""Oh you're going to Chicago?  You HAVE to eat at Pequod's... lemme show you something.""The crust (oh, the crust!) is a chewy, buttery, jewel of a treat in and of itself, and is what stands out the most.  It is not the floury, floppy NYC crust with the fabled magic mineral-water flavor of which I'm fond, and it's not the behemoth uber deep dish pie that people associate with Chicago.  It's more like a Pizza Hut deep dish on roids.  I can't believe I'm going to say Pizza Hut in a Pequod's review, but it is the easiest way to describe the general shape of the pizza.  Either way, Pizza Hut, you're welcome.Cheese, sauce, toppings are all strong enough to hold their own as well.  Just do yourself a favor, (stop me if you've heard this) if you are going to Chicago you HAVE to eat at Pequod's.  Sure, if you have time- check out the John Hancock building and Millennium Park, but by all means, get Pequod's."
"By recommendation of a local bartender, my family and I had trekked out to Pequod's for some deep dish pizza. It was relatively dead on a Sunday around 3 pm. I don't want to say that the service was bad, but the waitress seemed like she vould care less. Rarely came to check up on us. The bus boy and another gentleman (manager?) came to check on how we were doing and they were both much nicer and more pleasant. I'm not quite sure about the caramalzied crust that everyone was talking about. There wasn't that much of a crust, and it wasn't that good. The pizza is mostly dough, like another person had mentioned. The crust at Lou Manalti's was much better, but Pequod's toppings were phenominal. They were fresh, big pieces, and all over the pizza. If only we could combine the two!"
"Best pizza ever. I had heard about this place from coworkers and had to check it. It did not disappoint. The crispy crust, the tastey sauce, and the perfect amount of gooey cheese! Ah, I love this place. Kind of hard to find parking and the service wasn't great but it's worth all of that for this pizza."
"After seeing too many Food Network / Cooking Channel / Travel Channel shows featuring the competition of Chicago-style deep dish pizzas at Pizzeria Uno and Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend and I decided that we should engage in the discussion as well and visit both locations.  We agreed that we would get one fried appetizer dish, one medium deep-dish pepperoni pizza, and soda. (Dessert only if we felt we could truly handle it.)So here's the experience at Pequod's Pizzeria (our third stop of the two):That's right, we were convinced to add a 3rd contender to our ultimate deep-dish competition.  Who convinced us?  Food Network magazine.  They had a special in a recent issue about the best pizza in every state, and we jumped to Illinois to find out if Food Network chose Uno or Lou, and we read that...  what the heck is a ""Pequod's Pizzeria""??We hit the 'net, and found out that on my two recent trips up to Webster to hit up Barnes & Noble and the awesomeness of Five Guys, I was walking RIGHT PAST this place.Well at about 4:30pm on a Sunday, we changed all that and entered the building for supposedly the best deep-dish 'zza Chicago has to offer, complete with caramelized cheese on the crust for that extra-savory flavor.Well, we got ourselves a seat and thumbed through the menu for our fried appetizer.  Boom!  Appetizer Combo: sign us up!After Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend had finally come to terms with fried zucchini, and these slices o' veggie were quite good.  She enjoyed the mozz sticks, since I'm the only fried mushroom fan.  They were quite tasty as well.  Poppers on an appetizer platter is just icing on the cake - good choice, Pequod's!And with proper timing, our pizza arrived.  Now THIS was the kind of deep-dish pepperoni pizza I was expecting.  The pepperoni had a great flavor and lovely crispiness to them.  The sauce was a FREAKIN' SAUCE!  Barely any chunks of tomato to be found!  I was in heaven!  And then the crust, with the caramelized cheese (which is a very fancy term for ""we just throw some extra cheese on the crust so it gets burnty/crunchy in the oven"") really does make all the difference, especially with the level of butter you can tell went into the dough.My only qualm with the pizza was the ratio of dough to everything-else-that-isn't-dough on the pizza.  I enjoy a really hearty and thick slice of pizza when I go for deep dish, but the thickness of the bottom dough/crust was getting to me after the second slice.  I couldn't even finish the third slice, which is frankly an embarrassment for a man of my rotund stature.  All that remained of the third slice was a mound of crust and dough with the flesh and sauce stripped off and consumed.Yet another round of deep-dish-pizza hilarity that would not allow room for a dessert.But before I leave you with the score, I have to mention the ""unique"" atmosphere of this place.Pequod's Pizzeria is, in my opinion, an Inside Joke.  The kind where somebody at the table says something that makes no sense to you, but everyone around you is snickering or cracking up and tells you that ""you just had to be here"" or ""it's a Jersey thing"" or some other excuse as to why you won't understand the joke.  That's how it felt here.  And at the center of it all is a mascot whale with a pair of panties on its head, just staring you in the face and DARING you to ""get the joke"".  And I didn't.  The metaphor extended to the waitstaff, who seemed to be enjoying conversations with each other more than with the patrons of the establishment.  I would NOT  say that we had bad service.  Not at all.  But after refilling our soda, our server would hang out at the bar with the bartender or the register with some other staff, making comments to each other and yukking it up in general.(There's also a mysterious second floor, which I believe it just extra seating.  I was intrigued, but grateful to be on the first floor and not having to entertain the thought of navigating steps with a tummy full of doughy, cheesy 'zza.)Near the end of the meal, I just had to try and get an explanation.  I pulled our server over and just flat-out asked, ""So why is the mascot a whale with a pair of panties on its head?""""I don't really know - I think it was created by the owner or something.  But it's pretty cool, I think.""Well, maybe the Inside Joke is just the simple fact that you're not able to know why the punchline is funny.  I agree it's kind of a humorous idea of putting panties on the head of a whale, but they would either have to be unthinkably-large panties or an unthinkably-small whale.  I still don't get it...But what I do get is that it's no joke that Food Network magazine made the right choice, because Pequod's Pizzaria hand-down beat out both Lou Malnati's and Pizzeria Uno in our deep-dish pizza competition."
Can't get enough of this place. Even though I'm a Chicagoan at heart I have never been a deep dish girl. This place has managed to make me have a change of heart. Super delish not to mention their lunch special is awesome!
Hands down my family's absolute favorite pizza spot.  Top it off with amazing service. Booked a table for my daughter to celebrate her 13th birthday with friends. Our server was so helpful as was the manager and other staff. I always over order to bring some home for the next day. We will continue coming back.
"It feels kind of superfluous to give these guys another review on top of their 1000+, but I need to emphasize, after somehow ignoring this place for so many years:You just can't not eat here. You cannot live in or visit this city without eating here. You are in a city that prides itself on its food, and this is the place at the very top of the city's collective imagination and, I guess, self-image. THIS is where you take people to show them what Chicago pizza is. This is what you envision when you think about Chicago pizza. At Pequod's, I was looking at the Platonic ideal of pizzas, and it had a caramelized crust."
"I am updating my review of Pequod's thanks to their great manager, Sean, who reached out to me after reading about my less-than-awesome customer service experience.  He was kind enough to take the time to address my concerns and so I gave the restaurant another go.  I am never disappointed with the pizza when we go here, so I appreciate the effort to make the entire experience positive.  Thank you!"
Service was super. Pizza was delish. Firs time having Chicago deep dish pizza. From sf. Excellent place over all.
"I'm Chicago born and raised, but have always preferred thin crust pizza over pan.  That is, until I found Pequod's.  I define their pan as ""died and gone to heaven.""  Sober, hungover, drunk...it's always amazing.  We probably order Pequod's delivery once a week, but nothing beats going in and getting it fresh out of the oven.  The sauce is perfect, with a little hint of sweet.  Depending on our mood, we usually go with sausage or pepperoni.  You can't go wrong either way.  The sausage is fresh, with a taste of fennel, and comes in big chunks all over the pie.  The pepp has a little kick, which really adds to the depth of flavor.  And not enough can be said about the ""carmelized"" cheese crust.  Man, I wish they could somehow create a crust appetizer, because I'd order that in addition to the pizza.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.There are also a handful of standout appetizers.  I'm not sure where they get their frying oil from, but they serve up the crunchiest jalapeno poppers with out-of-this-world creamy ranch.  I haven't found a better popper...and trust me, I've tried.  Onion rings with BBQ sauce or wings are other favorites. If you haven't been, go now.  Other Chicago style pizza joints don't stand a chance.  I heart you Pequod's."
this is based off of lunch........here's the deal.  One pizza and a beer for five bucks.  Seriously will change your expectations for lunch value.  I'm actually going in a few minutes...I'll be ordering two of the specials for me cause why not?  If I could go here daily I would.  I'm pissed that I just shared this intel...
"Best deep dish in the city, I always recommend it to anyone traveling in for chicago style pizza. It's a treat!"
"Peaquod's comes the closest to scratching my itch for Detroit/Buddy's style pizza in this city. Robust sauce, delightful caramelization around the edges, and I don't end up in a cheese coma after 1 slice."
"Pequod's is absolutely remarkable!  I have never been disappointed with any of their offerings, read ever.  I love all the different pizza suggested namesake combinations, the house salad with anyone of the dressings available, though am especially partial to the house Italian (do it on the side).  Beer and spirits are available and I highly encourage that you inquire to your server as to suggested pairings, this goes along way--trust me.Oh, and finally, when you may be in a rush to eat or to get to your next destination...order to go and pick it up, the place gets busy and things may take a while to sit, order, and eat---do yourself a favor."
"My cousin recommended that we eat here instead of my customary Chicago deep dish pizzeria, so I found myself at Pequod's for the first time last night. One star deducted for ignoring his 6:30 reservation... we had to wait 20+ minutes for a table. But that was the only black mark. The service was topnotch and very friendly. The appetizers were wonderful, and the pizza was delicious! As some other reviewers have noted, it is not the same as other deep dish varieties. One big difference is the caramelized crust, which I thought was terrific. They also have Goose Island on tap (the GI brewery is just down Clybourne), which goes very well with pizza. We would definitely return!"
"There aren't that many original pizza joints anymore, even in a pizza mecca like Chicago, but Pequod's is one.  They take deep dish to the next level with their carmelized crust baked in the cast iron pizza pan.I've been to many of Chicago's pizza joints and most of them are great, but this one really stands out above the rest.BTW they got my 5 stars soley based on the flavor of the Pizza... it is that good.  The service in the place is decent, but nothing special.  Sort of as you would expect at a pizza place.  However, the pizza never dissapoints.If you haven't been here you have to go.  You have no right to call yourself a pizza connoisseur until you do!"
"Great pizza, salads and jalapeño poppers. Surprisingly family friendly.  We had our six year old twins there on Friday night and there were several other families.  We had the pepperoni deep dish which takes an hour to cook and it's worth it. Had the periods salad with pepperoni and it was great no desert review."
"Let me just say, I love Chicago pizza.  Came here from out of town and this place was highly recommended, so I had to try it. It was definitely good. The crust was the best part of the pizza. It takes about an hour to make, so be prepared. Unfortunately, we came around 6:30 on a Saturday and the wait to be seated was 2 hours!! Wtf. Was it worth waiting a total of 3 hours to finally have a slice? No. But, it was one of those things where we were from out of town, it was highly recommended and we wanted to try some real Chicago pizza. If you go, plan for a wait or don't go hungry!"
Simply the best of all time. The sausage pizza with carmelized crust is to die for. If i ever moved away would always wish i was eating pequods
"Quick tips:-Get the sausage giardiniera-Put your name down, figure out what you want to order, and place the order before they seat you so your food comes out faster!-5 stars for the deliciousness-5 stars for the price (6 people, two medium pizzas, beers = ~$10 a person)We came here on a Sunday evening with a group of 6 and were seated in about 20 mins.  The sausage giardiniera was fantastic.  As a San Franciscan, I will qualify that this is my first true exposure to Chicago deep dish pizza from Chicago, and it was pretty amazing.  Pequod's was highly recommended by friends who live in the area and while I acknowledge everyone has their 2cents about their favorite Chicago deep dish, this one definitely lived up to expectations.If you're new to town like us, take the Red line up to check this place out!"
"My friend said the thing I have to do while in Chicago is try a deep-dish pizza. Too bad my boyfriend hate deep dish, because he thinks it's just mostly bread. We managed to find this place after a fail attempt looking for hamburgers.My boyfriend said that this place was broadcast on one show on the Food Network, so I was wondering what the hype was.We ordered a side of mozzarella sticks and a small thin crust pizza with a crapload of toppings, which kind of added up to a hefty bill. ($1.50 for extra toppings on a small pizza? Them toppings better be fresh..!)In my mind, I had tried a thin crust pizza from Pizza Hut, and I thought it was like crackers with tomato sauce. This place blew that stereotype AWAY! The crust was flaky, but not too thin that you had to put napkins on your lap to prevent sauce from dripping.Would highly recommend this place for a late night grubbin'!"
"The caramelized crust is the pizza. As everyone knows, Chicago has a lot of options in the pizza department, but the crust at Pequod's is what makes this place unique and the pie incredibly tasty. Loved our deep dish -- huge hunks of sausage and really generous veggie toppings. Family-friendly environment; no airs in this place. Nice beer selection -- although they were having some tap identity crisis while we were there and couldn't seem to get that straightened out. Nevertheless, our small group of three had a large deep dish and a mega salad and left with pizza to spare. STRONG RECOMMENDATION  -- eat the pizza there. Don't bother taking it home. It loses so much in microwave translation. Husband was 'eh' on his reheated slice and now I have to make a return trip (woe, is me) to show him the real deal."
This is the best. I stick with the pan pizza because it's delicious. Just keep in mind that the pizzas take a little while to make - we usually get a big salad to share while we wait.
"Went here with my family and friends, it was quite a long wait even with reservations. Carry out would be a smart choice if you don't like waiting. The night we went was extremely muggy and it was even hotter inside because it was so packed with people."
"This was great deep dish, and it will be your favorite if you like the caramelized crust. Personally, I like more savory crusts.I recommend making reservations and/or placing your order while you're waiting. We were seated upstairs in the back room, which was quite loud/ had more of a rowdy sports bar environment... but the other upstairs room was a lot more mellow, so might be worthwhile to request specific seating if this matters to you. It was definitely *too* loud for me."
"Went here late on a Sunday night.  Great vibe, great service, and the pizza is honestly amazing and I fashion myself as a pizza expert!  Deep dish is better than Lou's and others In the local area, in my opinion of course!"
"The best I have had in chicago. Totally worth the trip and I love that its quite local. The location is a little bit remote, but I don't mind that at all. By far my favorite pizza place in chicago and try to make it there for their awesome lunch special."
"Hands down the best deep dish in Chicago. And I will argue that till I die.Carmelized crust. Good balance of cheese. Great tasting sauce.I'll admit sometimes there can be too much bread, but often its made just right. Depends on the chef working perhaps?Also pequods has great ranch. My boyfriend and I love this place - I introduced him to it. We're going on 5 years - and he still loves it.Sometimes we will go in ad eat before we catch a movie. Mostly we order it in. It's definitely a cold weather food - we don't order much in the summer. Oh and it's open late! Order this pizza. But that's it. Nothing else on the menu is that good, but the pizza. I recommend pepperoni and garlic deep dish. You won't regret it."
This place is the best local pizza joint you will ever find.  This is the best pizza in Chicago by far.   Small and cramped but that is part of the ambience. Fantastic food.  Great service and kid friendly.  Must try!!!
"I have live in the Chicago suburbs for 12 years. I dont get downtown as often as I like, but when I do its usually for great food! I found this place on Yelp searching for organic food in Chicago. The 40 year old seasoned pans and caramelized crust was all I needed to read to know this is where I wanted to go to get pizza! We had to wait about 40 minutes tio get a table at about 7:30pm on a Friday. The service was great! The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The aroma of the crust was heavy through out the entire restaurant and was making my mouth water! We ordered sausage, pepperoni and onion on a medium pan pizza. OMG!!! This is by far the best pizza I have had since I moved out here! I will be back as often as possible! When we left at about 9pm, there was still a 40 minute line outside! Seems to be a well kept secret! YUMM!"
"Their food is the bomb but service is horrible. You will be annoyed, agitated, thirsty, and downright hungry but when the food arrives you forget all your previous grievances. Some of the best pizza and salad I have had in the city."
"It's crowded, but it's worth the wait for this savory cheesy deliciousness. At Pequod's it's all about the pan pizza--which is Deep Dish, but not stuffed (like Giordano's--which is also delicious). For toppings, I  highly recommend the meatballs. Pequod's is a Blackhawks bar, so its particularly crowded when the Hawks are playing."
"It's Friday during the season of Lent. For this Catholic boy and his buddies, this meant that we've been abstaining from the consumption of meat all day. This is a tough day for carnivores jonesing for late-night za so in typical dude fashion, we get down to Pequod's just before midnight. Strategy, get the order in on Friday, enjoy it as soon as Saturday happens. Secondary strategy, make it half giardiniera and half pepperoni. Eat the Lent-friendly side first in case the order shows up early. Btw, the pizza came out just in time and it was AWESOMEly good. I heart you Pequod's. Religious obligation...check, gastronomic obligation...check, check and check."
"Simply delicious.  Come early!  At peak hours it is still worth the wait though.  Definitely try the deep dish pizza, the crust is full of flavor and the ingredients taste hot and fresh.  One of the places that I always bring out-of-towners to enjoy Chicago pizza and some beers and they always love it here."
"This is hands down the best chicago deep dish. It doesn't have that doughy layer of who-knows-what that giordanos has on top. It just has pure layer after layer of toppings topped off with a caramelized crust. Perfect deliciousness. Also have beers by the pitcher, went so well with my jalapeno topping. 2 slices from the medium pizza and I am done. There could be a good wait if you come in the middle of primetime even though they have additional seating area upstairs."
Amazing pizza! The crust was bomb. The waitress was super cool and recommended the best pizza.
"Top drawer/ Best pan pizza around. I went to the location in Niles when I was a lad, and now I go to this one. They are consistently good. Fast service, had to make the 630 movie, walked in at 540, food came out quick. DO get: Pan pizza with garlic, basil and extra cheese. Do not get: liquor. I got 4 shots, 2 beers and a small pan and the total was $65 without tip. DAAAMN! I was feeling splurgy since it was my mistresses bday. Gotta spoil em. REAAAALLY good pizza dough, (DID YOU CATCH WHAT I DID THERE?) my favorite in the city. The crust is amazing. I want another right now.No pool tables. But full bar, with Makers neat = 2.5 fingers."
"When you make the best pizza in Chicago, you're going to have an awful wait. So, plan your trips to this top tier pizza joint ahead of time. The caramelized edges of their deep dish is unbeatable."
"Burnt cheese on the pizza!!!! My favorite part!!!! This place came very highly recommended by many people and everyone I refer falls in love! The service is always decent and the food never disappoints!!!!! It's a pretty easy place for families , after work, or date. It's not my favorite but if I'm in the area this is my to to spot for pizza. One of a kind and a crowd pleased!"
"Love this spot. More of a pan pizza and not a deep dish - we're only talking like 2"" thick. BUT STILL! The best pizza in Chicago. Gotta try it!"
"This is, by far, the best pan pizza in Chicago! We enjoy coming here and love that the kitchen is open late! Keep up the good work!"
"Only being to Chicago a handful of times, I've always been chasing the best pizzeria in the city. I've done my rounds with the tourist locations like Giordano's, Gino's East and Lou Malnati's. Even though each one was a spectacular deep dish pizza, getting the recommendation for Pequod's from Chicago natives changed everything. The caramelized cheese on the crust and the perfectly executed marinara sauce make this the best damn pizza I have ever eaten. It's amazing."
"Amazing food. Service is variable, but who cares when the deep dish pizza is this good! I have been here multiple times and ordered in. It is the only place I know where the personal pizza is as good as the bigger pizzas."
"Probably the best deep dish I have had in chicago. I didn't care much for the peaquod salad, but man that pizza was amazing"
"Having recently moved to Lincoln Park, I wanted to go on a little walk around my neighborhood to check out some local spots which could have the potential to become my regular ones. Pequod's just might be the winner for my new pizza joint!This review is based only on carry-out because I didn't have enough time to dine-in.A Medium Deep Dish 1/2 Sausage and 1/2 Spinach and Mushroom was calling my name, so I called my order in at about 7:30pm for pick-up. The girl I spoke to was extremely friendly, and even knew my name even though I didn't tell her. I'm assuming she was either a secret agent spy, or had a pretty cool caller-ID on her phone, either way it made the experience a lot more personable.Around 7:50pm, I made my way over to pick up the pie. The hostess was really friendly too, and told us that I could pay and pick up at the bar. The place was pretty full for a week night, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. The pizza itself is delicious. I loved the crust, mushrooms, cheese, sausage, and spinach- all were fresh and tasty. Although, I didn't fall in love with the tomato sauce, I think I could look past it. The serving size was also very generous, and 1.5 slices were more than enough for me. Needless to say, I had plenty of leftovers for the next day.Overall, a great experience at Pequod's and would recommend it to anyone in the mood for some great pizza!"
"I'm not from Chicago, but the city is known for deep dish.  So, even though Pequod's offers thin crust, I did not try it.  When in Rome??  But, I have been to 4 or 5 different pizza places in Chicago and hands down Pequods is the best deep dish.  They start by lining the edges of a cast iron pan with mozerella cheese. This creates a stupid good carmalized crust on the pizza.  The flavors are incredible.  We added italian sausage and it was the best sausage I've ever had on a pizza.  Quality sausage.  The place is packed, especially on weekend evenings, but if you have the time to wait, it is well worth it.  They also have a fantastically cheap lunch special for $4.95.  Includes a 7"" deep dish with one topping plus a beer or soda.  Can't beat that with a stick."
"It's pretty much impossible for me to pick a favorite pizza in Chicago, but if you want to say it's Pequod's, I'm not about to disagree with you.  Also...if they ever decided to sell strips of caramelized crust as a pseudo-breadstick appetizer, I'd probably devour twenty at a time."
"Best pizza ever. MAN, everything about it was wonderful. Made to order and soooooooooooo incredibly good, with fresh ingredients, flavorful and just plain right. Best pizza ever."
"Been here twice and haven't been disappointed.  It's not a ""stuffed"" pizza, but it's still delicious!  The difference being this pizza has a thick layer of fluffy crust/dough rather than a thick layer of cheese like you'd get from Lou's or Giordano's.  It does take about 45 minutes to make a pizza so keep that in mind."
I forgot to update this! I went back about a year later and the food was amazingly good. That one dry pie we got must have been an anomaly. So good!
"I like whales and I like pizza.  I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that pizza makes me look like a whale, but that's beside the point.  Doing some errands, I passed by Pequod's and decided the siren song of pizza was greater than my need to save money or lose weight.  It happens.  Besides, I needed a reward after having to put back a running skirt that I so desperately wanted that cost $60. It seems like a few people are like WTF to the caramelized crust, but come on people, it's like the char on a marshmallow over a campfire.  AMAZING.  The sausage is delicious and you can taste all the herbs and the sauce is pretty great also.  It's a little hard to cut, but what they hey?  I like a challenge.  We waited for less than 2 minutes, our server and the host were super friendly, and the prices were decent.  I'm intrigued by the $5 personal pizza and beer lunch special.  Who wants to skip work???Also- this whole whale tail thong thing makes my head spin... a thong on a whale on a thong, which will inevitably be a whale tail when you try to cram your pizza laden ass into your skinny jeans.  Crazy."
"Made a reservation for a large group for lunch on Sunday afternoon. Great service. Were seated immediately. The ""half"" pastas are really small. So order accordingly. Pizzas took about 50 minutes which was as expected. However, even though it took a while, was worth the wait!"
"I'm definitely a fan of this place.  I was originally taken aback when we thought we made a reservation by emailing the restaurant, only to find out upon arrival at the restaurant that the email request was just ""taken into consideration.""  Some people waited upwards of TWO WHOLE HOURS to be seated.  It's another 40 minutes for your pizza to come out!  Because we had emailed Pequod's and requested an 8 pm seating, we only had to wait an hour.  We were basically bumped up to the ""high priority"" list of parties to be seated.  Once seated, we didn't know who our server was.  We were at our table for a good ten minutes and no one stopped by so we just grabbed server who was walking by and placed our order.  We had plenty of time to sit outside and look over the menu, so we knew exactly what we wanted once we were in. We started with the breaded shrooms.  Meh, I've had better breaded mushrooms.  I thought they were going to come out like stuffed mushrooms.  They were more like deep fried mushrooms with a lot of batter.  I ended up pulling the actual mushroom out of the breading and eating it plain instead.  Then the pizza came out. I guess Pequod's pizza can't be technically considered deep dish, but rather pan pizza?  WHO CARES?  IT WAS AMAZING.  The sauce was great, the crust was nice and crispy, plenty of toppings.  On top of all that, our server accidentally put in a medium size order for us when we originally asked for small.  They apologized and only charged us for the small!  I wanted to apologize to the restaurant for not being able to finish our food!  We were leaving Chicago the next day, so we couldn't even take the pizza home.  So sad.I would definitely suggest this place to others.  But would add the caveat, if you want to be seated close to when you want to eat, make sure to email in advance a reservation request!  I don't know that I would wait two hours for Pequod's, much less any restaurant, but I would definitely do an hour wait."
"A friend who recently moved to Chicago had their deep dish, and was simply raving about it. So I was compelled to try it out myself. I made the mistake in trying to get a table on a Saturday night, so we passed on it. Over a month later, we came back when it was less busy, and wow, it was worth it! I ordered a medium to eat that night and take home a little leftover, with some AMAZING sausage and black olives. Having read on here just now that they take reservations, really helps next time I want to come back. It's a pretty small place, not at all conductive to waiting, but once you're in there, it's worth it!  If you're coming via transit, take the Red, Brown or Purple (express) to the Fullerton station, and then take the 74 Fullerton bus west, get off at Greenview, and walk south towards N Clybourn, the place will be on the left just across the street from Regal Cinemas and Barnes & Noble.And there's no A in the name. Now I know."
"If I didn't have an italian mother, this would be the best. Oh wait... I dont. So you know to come here instead of my ma's."
"fun atmosphere and amazing deep dish pizza, my personal favorite is the pepperoni deep dish. The crust is mouth watering! Definitely recommend going here if you are craving delicious deep dish pizza"
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet!This is my all-time-favorite pizza. Ever. Ever ever.I'd take this any day over Lou's or Gino's East or Giordano's or anything else in Chicago. Sausage is hunkier than Jordan Catalano and only slightly cheesier. There is no better deal than their $5 personal pan lunch special complete w/ blah-domestic beer (whatever. the $5 for the pan alone is worth it....I'll take any excuse for alcohol on top of it.)Thank you, Pequods. Thank you from the bottom of my satisfied gut."
Best pizza I've ever had. Period. Traveling through Chicago this week and can't wait to come in! Deep dish baby!
"One random Saturday afternoon Aaron picked up our food network magazine to see a spread about the fifty states and the best pizza in each one, we decided to see for ourselves if this place could beat out Uno;s and Lou's. It's a divey dark, kinda small but with a second floor kind of bar setting place. The waitstaff adorn shirts of the mascot which is a whale with a pair of panties on it's head. I couldn't figure out what the joke was there, but ah well. Everyone was friendly enough. Aaron and I decided to order up a deep dish pepperoni pizza and the fried appetizer platter. The timing was good because the appetizer came out fairly quickly. Everything on it was good, the stand out though, were the Jalapeno poppers. They had cheddar cheese in the middle rather than the more standard cream cheese. It was a really nice and tasty touch. The pizza was also fantastic. I loved the touch of the burnt parm cheese cooked on top of the crust. It was also a very balanced za just the right amount of sauce and cheese on it. The dough had almost an olive oil taste to it, and I swear that the sauce had a touch of red wine in it. The pep[eroni was nice and crisp and thin sliced with a hint of spice in it. All in all it was a great dinner. I keep telling Aaron that we need to make a return trip because that za was crave worthy."
"I made the trek (as a tourist) from dtown Chicago...jumped on red line & walked for 15-20mins. IT WAS WORTH IT! Although the fried zucchini were just par for the course, they keep me occupied while I wait the prerequisite 30 mins for good deep dish. I ordered the pepp & sausage pan w caramelized crust and it did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and the Official Blackhawks bar took me back to the Roenick & Chelios days. Now if have to carry my leftovers back :)"
"Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago, period. There's really nothing else that needs to be said. The caramelized crust is wonderful. Great ingredients. Friendly service.If I have a friend making a short trip to Chicago, I'd probably tell them ""Lou's"" is the one to try based on pure convenience/name. But when TRUE Chicagoans ask my opinion on my favorite pizza, it's PEQUODS without a doubt.And btw, to all of the ""The suburban location doesn't lose anything"" people....the suburban location is the original."
Love it! It's my go to spot. I take people from out of town here a lot and I always get the sausage and spinach. always bring some home because it's a lot. Definitely the best deep dish in city.
"I am visiting Chicago and many of my friends suggested either Pequods or Lou Malnatis and Pequods is definitely better . The pizza overall is saucier, crispier and has more flavor compared to Lous which taste just like bread with cheese . Pequods is also very friendly with the toppings. It had a little more bread than expected but overall great deep dish experience ."
"A few visitors from out of town, who have never had the pleasure of eating deep dish, visited Chicago and was excited to try deep dish pizza at Giordanos or Ginos East. Umm...no, I will have to veto this. You know nothing, friends. Girlfriend and I took them to Pequods instead. I have been to Pequods several times now and left with a bellyful of delicious pizza. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful and the crust, as you may have heard, is caramalized cheesy goodness. We got the sausage, onions, and bell peppers (for me and the others who know how to eat pizza) and the veggie (for those who dont understand pizza). That is the only way to get pizza - sausage, onions, bell pepers, and maybe garlic. Other ingredients are just wrong. The only slight criticism I have is that the pizza is a bit doughy, even for deep dish.  But the sauce, over abundance of cheese, and the fresh ingredients make up for it."
"Had this deep dish for the first time yesterday night after getting home late from ohare. I have to say my boyfriend and I were impressed. We got a 12"" pan with sausage mushrooms onion green peppers. The Italian sausage was so tasty. We wanted some left overs and there was plenty! I could only eat 1 piece. So filling. Also the pricing was beyond reasonable. I was shocked that for all those toppings and size it was only $25. Will definitely be coming back."
"Needed to take deep dish pizza off my bucket list. Whereas I have to conclude that I personally prefer thin crust, if you want a deep dish experience, then this is supposedly the place to go.The pizza takes about an hour to prepare (no wonder), the place is semi-divy which gives it a gritty but yet cool atmosphere and it is (from what I could tell) in a totally random location. Can recommend that if you are in Chicago and want to go deep dish...PS: even if you normally can eat big volumes, order a small deep dish or share a medium. I wasn't able to finish a shared medium one."
Really loved this place. Delicious pizza. Good drink menu and good prices. Wait time for food was a bit long (hour) but well worth it. Waitress was super nice and attentive as well...unfortunately don't recall her name. Will be back again if I'm in the area! And recommend to others
"The food and atmosphere in here were fantastic and I would definitely visit again. However, when we first arrived we were seated at the back upstairs and for some reason everything was vibrating (the table, chairs, cutlery, etc.). I can only assume that this is because it's situated above the kitchen fan. The waitress was very helpful and facilitated our move downstairs but if  you are coming here I definitely try and avoid the upstairs backroom."
"Their thick crust is quite bready, which is nice compared to the overly cheesy ones. The cheese gets slightly burnt on the crust, and i consider this the best part!!"
"Yes! Amazing. Having never been a fan of deep dish pizza, the food here revealed a whole new kind of deep dish pan pizza to me. If you have had deep dish and think that the crust is too dry, this is the spot for you! Great service, which included the helpful tip that if you call ahead, they will make sure your pizza is 10min away from being ready when you are seated. Sweet!"
"The best deep dish in the city!  I love every style of pizza, but if I'm craving deep dish, there's only one place I'll consider!  This place is solid.  I used to LOVE their lunch special (7"" personal pan with a beer for $5), but it's only offered with a soda now.  Still a great deal.  Get a Large, enjoy your leftovers."
I have no idea why I haven't been here before! This place is great! The deep dish pizza was amazing. They did mess up on my order but they gave me a free small pizza. How great is that? I definitely recommend coming here if you haven't already. The staff was also very nice. I had a overall great experience. =]]
"This is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. I usually just stick with the standard pepperoni and they load it up with toppings. The dough is fluffy and all the ingredients are high quality. Great atmosphere if you dine in and they have a really large delivery zone. I live in the south loop and they typically get my pizza to me within an hour. Def a must try, you'll love them."
Great pizza that's doing its own thing. Rises above your typical Chicago pizza joints without doing anything fancy.
Some of the best pizza I have ever had. The crust is caramelized for a sweet taste. Service was excellent. Too bad they don't offer their pizzas frozen to go.
"I'm not a Chicago native but I do love me some pizza, especially deep dish.. and Pequod's DID NOT disappoint. The crust was simply amazing.. I can't even think of descriptive words other than that. And they offer one of the best deals I've ever experienced.. the lunch special. If you're in this area of town on a weekday, you can't beat the price--$4.95 for a personal one-topping deep dish AND a BEER! (or soda). Seriously.. the bud light alone cost $4.50. The service was fast and friendly and I have recommended this place to friends already.. although the location is a little out of the way of touristy things."
This pizza is so delicious!  I love the sauce so much. The pan pizza is the one to get. Burnt edges are crispy and crackly. The pepperoni is one every slice. Super filling so you always have leftovers. The Pequod salad is perfect too. Go here!!!
"Can't believe I never wrote a review since I love this place. Their deep dish pizza is amazing! Their lunch specials is that too. Not sure if they still do it but Monday-Friday from 10:30AM - 3-PM you can get a small deep dish with your choice of toppings (for like $1 extra if you choose 3 or more but that's including meats). I ordered their medium sized deep dish before and it was huge! I only finished 2 slices and I was full. It took me like 2 days to finish it. This is coming from someone who has a ridiculous appetite and can probably compete in those food contest. Check this place out if you love pizza. It is kinda pricey but that's because of all the ingredients they put into their pizza. Oh, the wait is really long. So if you're an impatient eater like me sometimes, you'll definitely wanna take that anger out on the pizza."
"5 stars. Period. Deep dish perfected: caramelized crust and tangy sauce, fresh toppings and cooked to perfection (in my book, the cheese should just start to be browning, the crust should be crusty on the outside and cooked through in the middle (not soggy/doughy/undercooked). The service was attentive and pleasant (when I dined in) and pickup was a snap (also a friendly/pleasant experience).  The decor is a blend of pizzeria, tavern, something, but I barely remember it -- I just remember getting a gorgeous pizza pie delivered to our table and loving every bite of it.Pequod's nails it. I love their pizza. I do. I'll be going back soon.P.S.: Dining in is definitely better than pick-up, but I'd say the same for all pizza. The drive home always allows the pie to cool a bit too much in my book."
"I'm not a deep dish person. I've found that at most places the crust is dry and flavorless, and the cheese/sauce ration is totally insane and impossible to enjoy. Pequod's is the exception. The crust is flavorful, seasoned, and crispy; there is a modest amount of quality cheese and really tasty sauce. I've had it in house and delivery, and it held up super well even though the drive to my place must have been 15-20 min. Really nice servers, though the host stand was kind of a mess when I got there, but it was worth the wait."
In my opinion this pizzeria serves best deep dish pizza period. Crust of deep dish at Giordano is very thick where as at Lou Malnatti its pretty thin.. but here its 'Perfect'..I'm visiting this place again for sure.
"I took a very short trip to Chicago and trying deep dish pizza was definitely on my list. I stayed at Hotel Lincoln and researched places online that had the best deep dish pies. With over 1800 reviews on Yelp, Pequod's looked very promising. It was very close to the hotel and my boyfriend and i took an uber to Pequod's. We sat at the bar and ordered a small (10"") pan pizza with mushrooms, italian sausage, pepperoni and basil. We waited for quite some time but the pizza was pretty yummy and met my expectations -- although i can't make any comparisons since this is the only place that I've tried in Chicago for deep dish. It was very tasty and i was pretty full after one slice. Overall, I'd say it was a good pizza but I'd be willing to try another spot."
"The pizza here was great! I went with three other people and we got a large cheese deep dish and a small peperoni deep dish, and we almost finished all of it. That's how great it was. The pizza's took a while to come out, but they were worth the wait. I'll definitely be back there soon!"
"I usually prefer thin crust to pan pizza but the way the crust is done here is just something else! I guess the pizza crust is caramelized and baked, giving the pan pizza a crispy outer layer. Definitely one of the better pizza places I've tried!"
"The best, repeat, THE BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO.We will get to the pizza in a moment, but first, everything else...Great local beer selection, great menu (outside of the pizza), fun atmosphere and a very nice staff.The pizza...life changing. For me, anytime you can say that the last bite you have of a meal is the best, well, you have yourself a good meal. It says something of a place when each bite gets better and better.Eat your meat loaded pizzas with a knife and fork, then save the crust and a tiny bit of sauce that escapes from your pie for dipping. The crust is the...freaking...best. The restaurant has been using the same deep dish pans since the dawn of man and all of those little garlic, cheese, oil and meat juices from the pans are seared right into the crust for the climax. I find it amazing that I can say that the best part of this pizza is the crust. Everything else is great...the cheese, the meats, the sauces...but the crust. Wow.If you are visiting Chicago and want some authentic deep dish, this is the spot where the locals go. And, it's never as insanely busy as the other touristy places that serve deep dish. It's very casual and feels like a neighborhood joint, which it totally is."
Recommend the pan pizza pepperoni is my personal favorite.. Had the zucchini as an appetizer was great love this place !!!
After going there for years we recently discovered the lunch special. A delicious 1 topping pan pizza with a beer for cheap. I wish I lived closer.
"This. Pizza is supposed to be like this.  ""Stick to your ribs, perfect ratio of sauce to cheese to toppings, you can't eat more than a slice or two without immediately slipping into food coma"" pizza.  This review is like a year late, but I just recently recommended Pequod's to a friend visiting the fair city and realized I hadn't recommended it to Yelp yet.  Pequod's pizza and a few beers were the perfect antidote to the Chicago Half Marathon.  And even with 12 months passing, I still have not forgotten the crisp, buttery crust and the thick, hot stuffing of Pequod's pizzas.  My mom will kill me for saying this, but this place is a reason I would move back home."
I just had Pequod's pizza for the first time while visiting Chicago for a wedding. It was excellent and reasonably priced.I will definitely come back next time I'm in town.
Good lord is this pizza good. The crust is the definition of perfection. Could eat this for days.
"Summary: Great deep dish pizza, with crispy caramelized crust.Came with a friend (local) and split a deep dish pizza. Was very filling, buttery, and rich, with a crisp cheesy crust.If I wanted deep dish pizza, would come back again."
Delish Pizza! Delish Sauce! Excellent crust! Quick friendly service. Excellent prices...800ish calories a slice (this is MY estimate) but sooooooo worth it.
"I am not a big fan of deep dish, but if you I'm craving it on the rare occasion, I go to Pequod's. It's cheesy, saucy, and the crust is the best I've had for deep dish. The service was incredibly slow and inattentive once you order, even when it wasn't busy so that takes a star off. TIP: They have a lunch special on the weekdays that's $5.95 for a personal pizza and a drink. You will be stuffed! I forget the hours unfortunately."
"This is the only deep dish in Chicago I crave and here's why.1) It's unique, no more throwing away the crust I guarantee you!2) They deliver, and if you go to their establishment wait times (to get a table and to get your pizza are not ridiculous as the other more well known deep dish pizza places.3) Their sauce.  To me that is 2nd in importance to the crust, and Pequods has a zesty, slightly sweet sauce that is much more memorable than the other more well known deep dish pizza places.  4) Their toppings are fresh and of high quality, no generic sausage and fresh veggies etc.5) Not so overpowering that you feel like you can't move around after you have a few slices.  Doesnt weigh a ton like the other places."
"kind of bummed about this review. I've heard awesome things about this place and so when I had a party at my house, we ordered Pequods. The delivery took 2.5 hours. We called the place an hour in and asked for an update. They couldn't find the order. They told us they were making it now and it would be the next order out. an hour and a half later, the pizza came and as you can probably imagine, it was cold. We ended up throwing the pizza away and ordering Jets. This place has awesome reviews, but for us it was not great."
"Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago is a tough call because they are all very good. There are two things I'd like to highlight about this place.  The crust and the speed of the pizza coming out to the table. Some of the competition take an hour and my pizza did not feel like it took this long.  The sauce might not be a rich tomato based say like Uno's, but overall I think this might be my new favorite overall.  I still have Gino's and Lou malnati's to try. I would definitely come back to enjoy again!"
"Went recently for lunch.  Bonus--on-street parking which we didn't have to pay for!!  Only a short wait for a table.  We got the large pizza--big mistake for two people!  It was huge, but absolutely delicious!!  We also got house salads before the pizza--they were about average.  The service was terrific, even during lunchtime.  There is always someone waiting on you--it's not like you have to find YOUR server.  You always feel taken care of, even when it's busy.  We agreed we will return!!  Loved it!"
"Third time's a charm.After trying and being disappointed with two of Chicago's most famous pizza establishments -- Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- I was beginning to think that a ""to-die-for Chicago-style deep-dish pizza"" was on the same level as the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny and Santa Claus...myth. Pequod's changed all that.Upon arriving we placed our names on the wait list, grabbed a menu and took a seat at one of the four benches outside of the restaurant. We decided on the large (14"") pan pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. After about 20 minutes our party was called, we were taken through the first floor of the restaurant, up the stairs and into the massive second level. Once seated we were given menus for a second time to see if we wanted to add appetizers, salads, etc. We decided on the Pequod Salad for our party of four with their homemade Italian dressing.The Pequod Salad came out a few minutes later -- Romaine lettuce with mozzarella cheese, peperoni, pepperoncini, black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, carrots, tomato and onion. Definitely a good choice. It was the perfect size for us to split. They didn't skimp on the toppings. And, the homemade Italian dressing as suggested by our server was delicious.As good as it was, you don't go to a place like Pequod's for the salad. A few minutes our pizza arrived -- 154 square inches (yes, I used an online calculator) of piping-hot pizza goodness. To save us from burning ourselves and making a mess of of the pizza, the server plated the first half of the pizza for us, using the square spatula to pick up the pizza and cut off the strings of melted cheese crawling from the pan onto our plates.Now the toppings on the pizza were, for the most part, comparable to both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- loads of pepperoni, thinly sliced mushrooms crisped by the oven, thick homemade tomato sauce and bubbling cheese. The difference, however, was found in the crust. At Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, the crust was too bready and even soggy because of all the sauce. But crust at Pequod's was heaven. They call it their ""famous caramelized crust"", an apt description. The crust was the perfect balance of buttery, chewy, crunchy, crispy, slightly-burned goodness. And at the edges, the cheese had melted to the side of the crust/pan to form a ""halo"" (their word, not mine) of caramelized cheesy/crusty deliciousness.In the end, that crust and that ""halo"" single-handedly saved Chicago's reputation for having a ""to-die-for deep-dish pizza."" For that all Chicago natives should be thankful. And, they should show their thankfulness by going to Pequod's. That's where we'll be next time we visit the Windy City."
"My experiences at Pequod's have continued to be great. I've brought a few friends here who otherwise are not deep dish fans and made them believers. Pequod's is in a league of their own when it comes to deep dish. The carmelized crust sets them apart...more of a ""crunchy"" than a ""so much cheese I'm going to die"" experience when you dine here. I love bringing friends to Pequod's and blowing their minds. I have tried the thin crust and don't think it's anything super special, but I am willing to endure a 45 minute train ride + 15-20 minute walk completely out of my way for this deep dish and I think that says a lot. On the odd occasion when I do drive, parking can be a hassle. But it's worth it for this place."
"Wow.  Just wow.Seriously, that's all I could think of as I was eating the beautiful creation in front of us.  The pizza is just... awesomeness.  I've had good deep dish and one of my favorite restaurant in LA has a great deep dish, so I had really high expectations going in to Pequod's.We were able to make a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday night and right when you get in, you can tell Pequod's the sort of neighborhood spot where on weekdays locals will come and watch them game while grabbing a bite and drinks.  The whole feel of the place is that even though Pequod's can be filled with tourists (like me), it is still a local spot, which I like.After a long hard look, decided to go with the deep dish with sausage, pepperoni, spinach, mushroom, garlic, and fresh basil.  First of all, that caramelized cheese crust, which gives the edges of the pizza a darkened crust, is just fantastic.  That crunchy crust is straight up addicting.  Forget all the stuffed crust and the whatever-crust-Pizza-Hut is coming out with now.  The cast iron pan is super well-seasoned, which differentiate the thick crust from being just bread.  As for the toppings, it's all to everyone's own personal choice but we loved the sausages.  Great huge chunks of sausage that goes so well with the delicious sauces and cheese.  We liked how there was lots of sauce, and you even have the option of going extra on the sauces!  The pepperoni was good and there's lots of it underneath all the cheese.  Definitely try to add some veggies though cause, especially spinach cause it fits perfectly.  Also helps to serve to refresh your palate mid-bite :P The pizza did take awhile, so we decided to get an order of onion rings.  Just your typical onion rings, served with BBQ sauce.They also have a pretty good selection of beers on draft.  Decided to go with a local brew and the Goose Island 312 is a nice beer with the pizza since it has a nice citrus note.  Good change.The pizza did take awhile but trust, definitely worth the wait.  Is it the best deep dish?  It may just be.  All I can say that by completely stuffing myself after 2 and a half slices of the large and 2 beers, I still want more.  In fact, I was feeling sad knowing that as soon as I leave Chi-Town, I wouldn't be able to have it anymore.  Sigh.Do they ship?"
"I was in Chicago for the weekend and wanted some  authentic Chicago pizza, this ended up being arguably the best meal of any variety that I've had in recent memory. Great service, amazing atmosphere, 10/10 would recommend and come back!"
Best deep dish in the city! Expect to have a bit of a wait but it is definitely worth it. You do need to also be in the mood for it because man is it filling.
"We just got off the O'hare International airport and the first thing came into mind was ""Deep Dish Pizza"".  Oh yeah, it's our first time in Chicago and my husband and I were craving for what Chicago is known for.  Thanks to Yelp and all the Yelp followers for helping me find this gem of a restaurant.  It was lunch time and the restaurant just opened up.  Before you know it, within less than an hour, it was packed - I kid you not.  They have a wicked lunch special.  Thank goodness for that lunch special cause my husband and I would not be able to finish up two pies (husband is a vegetarian and I love my meat).  I barely finished my small personal pie.   The pie was so tasty, with the red sauce and the sausage tasted just like the sausage I would get on my pie in NYC.  The crust was nice and crunchy, which added a nice texture to the pie.  Yes, it does take time for the pie to come out, it's deep dish what do you expect.  They have to thoroughly cook the dough properly.They serve alcohol, but I really was more famished than thirsty.  And this restaurant did the right thing, by making their authentic Chicago deep dish pie. Oh by the way, Lou Malnati's is too generic, especially that I saw that it's all over Chicago.  I am a huge supporter of the small stores that make a huge impression on their food and attitude because that's what you need to survive in the food industry.  Give this place a shot, you will not regret it.  My husband and I surely don't.  We know pizza, we are from NYC----land of Italian restuarant...need I say more."
"I'd like to carmelize my shoes the way Pequod's carmelizes their crust. There's a few places that make pizza like this. Burt's and Gullivers to name a couple. I've heard some history from some friends that Burt originated both Pequod's and Gulliver's, then he sold the establishments and the recipes to have his own little nook outside of town. I dont care how it all wenkt down, I'm just happy places like this exist. There's nothing worse than a crappy pizza joint. Pizza Hut, Dominos, PaPa John's, Hungry Howie's, etc. etc. etc. The wait can be long for your pizza. Just order a salad and have a few beers to quell your impatience."
"This is a great little sports bar atmosphere and it gets pretty busy as well, we just got here in time before the crowd hit.  The pizza itself doesnt look pretty or anything.  But damn once you take a bite of the crust its awesome!  We ordered a sausage, mushroom and black olive pizza.  The flavors were all there, the sauce was good and the crust was cooked perfectly."
Best pizza around. Been going here for years and it won't stop anytime soon. Plenty of seating in a fun staff. And lots of TVs
The cheese baked outside the crust is like a party for my taste buds! The rest of the pizza left a bit to be desired in the flavor department.
Went for the 1st time this past weekend and the pizza was amazing. Was about a hour wait but expected with it being a Saturday night.
"I am quite picky about my pizza, so I don't make this statement lightly: this is the best pizza I have ever eaten. Bacon is not an available topping, but the pizza is so good you won't notice. Eat the pizza. Do it. Do it."
"I had been hearing about this place for quite some time. Finally, one evening, my boyfriend and I decided to go there for dinner before a movie. We got a cheese pizza with black olives and jalapeno and extra sauce. Boy when that pizza arrived my mouth dropped. It was a typical juicy Chicago style pizza. When a pizza is so messy that it falls apart in your hand you know its delicious pizza. I was very impressed.I also noticed it's environment is sporty. Would be fun to watch a hockey game or baseball game here one night.The staff were mutual. Nothing special there.But, great pizza!"
"I was visiting Chicago and needed to try the famous deep dish pizza.  Yelp pointed me to Pequod's and I was not disappointed.  I had the pepperoni and sausage personal (7"") pizza and it was delicious.  Each pizza is made personally for each customer, so it took about 30 minutes before I could indulge.  The sauce was slightly sweet and the crust was out of this world good.  The sausage was freshly cut and really made the pizza pop.  The pizzeria had a decent beer selection on tap which was a great complement to the food.  Service was friendly and attentive.  If I was a Chicago resident, I'd frequent Pequod's as much as my waistline allowed it."
"Nashville is really not known as a pizza city, so I was looking forward to trying it in a city that is known to get it right.  I picked Pequod's from the many choices available.  When we arrived, it was Saturday night at 8:15. Not surprisingly, the place was packed!  I was told it would be about an hour and a half wait, but we were willing to wait.  We were given a pager and walked across the street to Barnes and Noble.  I was surprised when the pager went off at 8:50.  We ran back over and the hostess was all smiles as she led us to our table.  The server was incredibly friendly and made us feel so welcome.  The atmosphere was loud but it was a good loud.  You felt like part of the crowd in there.  We ordered a thin crust and a deep dish.  Beer was brought almost immediately and it was very cold.  A little wait for the pizza, but all it took was one bite and I was in pizza heaven.  How they are able to make such delicious pizza is a mystery to me, but you know what? Who cares?  This was absolutely great pizza and a great Chicago experience!  The staff was incredible, the atmosphere was fun, and the pizza was perfection!  Do yourself a favor and come HERE for pizza in Chicago!!"
"Sausage pan pizza is amazing. One of the best deep dish pizzas I have had in Chicago. Highly recommend it. Very busy at some times though, I recommend calling ahead to see if you can reserve a spot."
"I'm not a deep dish fan, but this is probably the best deep-dish I have had to date (I've also been to Giordano's and Lou Malnati's several times since they are closer to where I live). We got the pepperoni pizza, which was great -- I only had one and a half slices because the wait for a table took quite a bit, and thus I filled up on beer. However, I def wished I could eat more -- the pepperoni was very tasty.We also got the appetizer combo, which consisted of mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, zucchini slices & breaded shrooms -- all very tasty and fried.I stil prefer piece pizza in wicker park, but when I have friends who crave deep dish, this is where I'll go from now on."
"Love this place! The pizza is delicious and they have a great selection of beer. The ambiance is laid back and casual. This is a great spot to go when you have a taste for pizza, but don't want it from your usual spot."
"Craving for pizza??...You can't go wrong at this place.  Whether you are into pan or thin, their signature caramelized crust makes Pequod's an original.  My girlfriend is not a big fan of pizza, but even she found it scrumptious. The atmosphere here is very welcoming, all types of customers, friends and families.  They have two floor levels and surely need both to seat the amount of customers that come in to eat and drink.I am going to dare say that Pequod's definitely gives Lou Malnati's a run for their money!"
Fabulous deep dish w/ a unique crust. Cozy and fun vibe.
"Service has always been good, food is great, and the atmosphere is fun. I haven't tried their caramelized crust pizza yet, only the thin crust which is good enough for me so far. I always ask for ranch dressing on the side to dip my pizza in, which is extra $ unfortunately. I would choose Pequod's over another pizza place anytime."
"Best pan pizza ever with real fresh ingredients! I love the lunch special: personal pizza and salad under $4.95! I got pepperoni garlic and basil. They are very generous with the ingredients which is nice to see! They also have craft beers on tap..my kind of place! I would compare the pizza style somewhat like Lou Malnatis. But that wouldn't be justice. This place is way better, way more Chicago authentic and not generic commercial crap. Servers are really nice too. I will definitely go back again and again!"
"Best Deep Dish in Chicago - beats out Gino's, Lou's, Uno's, and Pizanno's for sure.  Don't be scared by the awning that is falling apart or the ancient looking sign...it is all worth it in the end.I have had the thin crust - don't waste your time and stick to the deep dish (Go to Pat's Pizza for thin crust)"
"This pizza rocks! It's funny that they call it a pan pizza (and it is), when you order it they correct you and call it deep dish. Whatever, it's called is carmelized cheese crusty goodness. These slices are no joke, they are just as filling as a deep dish should be. Had sausage and mushroom and it was yummy. Their sausage means meat, not those rinky dink sausage balls. Even though I really, really, really love deep dish this stuff is tops! I'd come back again and again.The line can be ridiculous, but they do a good job of getting people in and out. The option to start your order ahead of time also helps. This pizza is worth it."
"Finally Pequod's!  I have had you bookmarked for too long. I am a big fan of deep dish pizza.  I have heard good things about Pequod's and was happy to get the opportunity to eat here.  So I put on my pizza eating pants and made way for Deep Dish.   Most of the time I got out to eat, I am a Lone Ranger.  So I don't normally go to pizza places because I feel awkward ordering an entire pizza to myself.  I went for the Sausage and Pepperoni with/ Onions Deep Dish-  Here's a couple things you need to know about Pequod's Pizza.  1) The Crust is dark and a little charred2) Most of the deep dish will be doughThe ingredients were spot on.  The sausage was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The spices in the sausage were insanely delicious.  The pepperoni's were average.  The crust is crisp and the middle of the pizza is doughy and delicious, but not undercooked.  The sauce was flavorful.  This was a excellent pizza.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXwS…yelp.com/biz_photos/DXwS…I would recommend this if you are ever in this area.  The pizza is some of the best deep dish I have had."
"I'm really not a big fan of Piece Pizza, but I went with a few friends and was told it would be hour and half wait.  WTF?  I know it's Saturday night, but It's not worth that kind of a wait.  Instead, we went to Pequod's because none of us had been there.  We arrive only to have to a 15 minute wait, which is much better.  We got deep dish pizza, which didn't take long to make.  The pizza was really good.  However, we all thought ""it could use some extra cheese.""  I told another friend the next day and she asked if we had extra cheese because they apparently don't put enough on it.  Ahhh, that would have been helpful.  Remember, ask for extra cheese!  It's worth it.  I can eat...alot.  I could only eat two slices of their deep dish.   Base your ordering on a 2 slices per person rule and you'll have plenty. I found the restaurant to be quaint and comfortable.  The service quick and friendly.  Worth going again.  I forgot to mention... In the time it took us to drive there, order, eat and pay, we would still be waiting for Piece Pizza to actually get around to seating us.  Which would you rather do?  Wait or eat?"
"I've always like Pequod's.  It tastes like adult pizza to me - darker flavors and not all sweet.  The carmelized crust is yummy.  The lunch special is a great deal, but they won't cook your pre-order anymore.  Not sure why - if people not showing up for their orders is a problem they could just ask for pre-payment and I'd be happy too since you have to wait 25 minutes otherwise (they should tell you that)."
"(the other location gets 5 stars, but this one sometimes is swingy in quality)This review isn't about the great pizza, or who it challenges for what sort of pizza challenge in the city. This is specific to one thing: lunch.Holy cow is the special efficient!If you're the type to imbibe, you might actually be stealing from them. Well, if you can drink just the one you get with the special. (Alcoholism - it's how they get ya)Yes, yes, it's lunch so we don't imbibe. Soda's also free, Coke products. Warning - no free refills in the special. (Sugarholism - it's how they get ya)The deal's a drink and a personal pan with one topping. Extra toppings cost a little bit more. I usually got sausage, onions, jalapenos because I'm a weirdo and it made the afternoon meetings shorter. It does take a little while if you don't call ahead - you're looking at a 45 minute lunch at least. (so, maybe call ahead, slacker)"
"Great weekday deal. The wait is long, but well worth it."
"very good deep dish, one of the best in the city, parking was kinda hard but still worth it,  not a whole lot of sausage on it and the crust was kinda hard, still quality tho"
"Stop reading this review and order this pizza right now! I seriously crave and miss this pizza every day. The lunch special is amazing! You get a personal size pizza with one topping and a drink for $4.95 (or at least what I remembered)!! If they could deliver this to Ohio, I would order it weekly by the pallet. The burnt caramelized crust makes the dough so sweet and savory.. Now my mouth is watering thinking about it. What I love most about this place is that it's not a chain and it's one of a kinda. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a slice of Pequod's heaven!!"
"I wish I lived closer to Pequod's because it's awesome. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and they've got a great selection of beers. Give it a shot!"
I walked right past this place but I'm glad I turned around. I had the wings and the pan pizza.. D E L I C I O U S. I will be coming back!!!
"Deep dish pizza and a Blackhawks bar?!?! What's not to love with this place.  This place is known for caramelized burnt cheese.  The pizza tasted great...crispy crust with a slight buttery taste...reminded me of my husband's homemade deep dish pizza.    The only thing is that there is not enough cheese.  Otherwise, the atmosphere is cool and the service was good.  Can't complain...wish I could be out here to watch a Hawks game."
"Wow.  Can't really compare this place to other Chicago spots because this was the only one I tried (other than Lou Malnati's at the Taste), but it was ... transcendent.  Or maybe that was just my brain misfiring due to the oxygen deficiency that occurred once the artery cheese chokehold commenced.  So good. This was one of those meals where you go beyond full, when you keep saying ""just one more bite"" until it is gone, and your stomach likes the abuse, secretly enjoys being pushed to maximum capacity.Staff was cool, beers were cold, ambiance was appropriately pizza parlor.  Worth the hike out from downtown for sure.   One of the better pizzas I've ever had."
"Never been a fan of pan pizza, that is until Pequod's. I can't stop going back. And the GM is simply amazing - where can you go on occasion and have the GM remember what your pizza preference is? Well he one upped our regular order by recommending the garlic on top. Amazing hit new levels. I'm an occasional regular for life."
fantastic charred cheese.  Innovative and fantastic.  Uniquely rustic pizza.
"Truly great pizza.Everything about Pequod's deep dish makes you want to... well, you know...leave the one you're with & start new relationship...I've been here many many times & have yet to had anything but great pizza.This is the place when 'they' talk about Chicago having the best deep dish.This is the place that YOU can count on when you want your toppings to be done right on your heavy-sauced-crispy-salty-sweet-deep-dished-mountain-of-a-PiZzAHHhh!And they are a Blackhawks bar, so that's always appreciated.Their sausage is that type of sausage that makes you think, Ohhh, this is how sausage is SUPPOSED to taste like on a pizza?!!Enjoy with a cold BEER. Always."
"okay, was recommended by a local, met there with a group, then the next day we were craving late night deep dish pizza, so made a taxi stop before heading to Kingston Mines!  Great pizza, service and quite a mouthful.  Go  hungry!  Great pizza."
I am only going to give it 4 stars because I feel like I'm having a food baby right now.  Because it was that good.  Very confusing I know I know but it's the way my pepperoni thick crust is going to have to crumble !
"Two people can't finish a small, unless you're gargantuan or unreasonable. Delicious pizza. Make a point to go every time I'm in Chicago."
"Hands down, BEST pizza in Chicago!! Delivery is fast and efficient as well."
"Outstanding!  This is the only place I know of where I can get a true Chicago-style deep dish pizza that is vegan (their crust is vegan, so you just have to order it without cheese).  My wife (who does not eat vegan) got her pizza with green peppers and sausage (and cheese of course) and said ""this is the best Chicago-style pizza I've ever eaten!""It was *very* kid-friendly and the staff was great.  We will *definitely* be eating here again!"
"great, lunch on a thursday, no wait to be seated. reasonable 30 min wait for the pizza to come out. best part was the lunch special 4.95 for a 7in pizza with 1 topping and a pint of bud light. so satisfied right now :3"
"I've been coming to Pequod's for years and I have never been disappointed by how outstandingly delicious it is.  The pizza arrives slowly, so come prepared to be patient and wait...It will be worth it, I promise.As everyone has already said, the crust is caramelized around the edge of the pan, and the sauce isn't on top.  However, they haven't captured how much of an incredible experience this is; I have to exercise restraint to keep from skipping right to the crust and forgetting about the rest of the pizza!  It's that good!The sauce is perfect.  There's a nice balance with the sweet to savory ratio, which I feel like is a pretty delicate balance to walk when it comes to pizza sauce.Get the sausage.  It's spicy and perfect, all blended in with the sauce and cheese and crusty goodness.They're also open pretty late, which is good if you're a procrastinator.  :)Very well done, Pequod's!"
Awesome Chicago deep dish pizza.  I've had Giordano's and Lou's... this place blows them both away.
This is some mighty fine pizza.  Thin crust pizza is my favorite but after hearing people talk about Pequod's deep dish pie we decided to give it a try. Without a doubt this is the best deep dish pizza I have ever had.
"How do I even begin to review the most amazing pizza place in all the land? Probably with the crust. The cheesy, burnt, delicious crust that may not look appealing to the eyes will certainly appeal to your tastebuds. While not a traditional Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza (it's a pan pizza) the the thick, crumbly crust and massive amounts of cheese will leave you just as satisfied. A medium pizza easily serves 3-4 people, at around $20, is a great value in addition to being absolutely delicious! Aside from the crust, the rest of the pizza is exactly what you would expect.  It has a good crust:sauce:cheese ratio and offers all your normal toppings. Personally, I recommend pepperoni and jalepeno. I order Pequods every time a new person comes to visit, and no one has ever been disappointed. Just don't wait until your actually starving to order since it will take at least 45 min for dine-in and has a pretty consistent 90 min delivery time."
"Best deep dish in Chicago!!! The wait time is pretty long but worth it, and it gets SUPER packed on weekend evenings. But I usually come here late night- love that it's open until 3 am!"
My 2nd time to Chicago in 2 months and my 2nd time ordering from here.  My friends that live here are now in love with this place... As am I!!
"Amazing Deep dish!! Worth the cab ride from the loop. We went for the lunch special so the pizzas were under $6 with a topping. You really can't beat it. Plus we got the fried appetizer sampler, which was on point. I've also been to Due. Different styles both good."
"Great pizza! Great lunch special! Sadly, there was a pretty loud argument happening between a manager and a bartender that went on for 15 minutes. It was awkward and very unprofessional. I love this pizza, but if this is what happens there, I will reconsider my pizza choice next time."
"I should have reviewed Pequod's long ago... They have the best deep dish in Chicago, no contest, the best. Whenever a friend visits and wants deep dish, this is the place to go! Their wings are also amazing, along with the pequods salad (don't miss it!) They also have a solid drink menu, that's reasonably priced! Needless to say, it's one of my favorite pizza places in the city!"
"This place is my favorite. I've been here 3 or 4 times. Get the deep dish - the crust is super crispy and the upper layers are filled with cheesy gooey-ness. This time we went with a group of 7 on a Saturday night. We called earlier in the day around 3:30p for reservations because we expected the place to be packed. When we arrived at 7:00p the placed was crowded (as predicted) but we breezed by those who didn't have the foresight to make a reservation and were immediately seated on the second floor. We ordered two pizzas - a sausage, bell pepper, and mushroom, and a pepperoni, and bell pepper. The sausage and bell pepper was a hit, and the pepperoni was a distant second. The fried appetizer plate was decent, but not a must-have. Like always, we ordered pitchers of Half-Acre. Despite the massive number of customers on the second floor, our waitress was awesome and was always around to refill our pitchers or to meet other needs. Per usual - dining at Pequods was an excellent experience."
"I wasn't impressed the first time I had it... it was a few years ago and I'd never gone back.  I'm a Lou Malnati's girl.  But my patients LOVE this place and talked it up this week, so I decided to try it again.  The hubs and I called it in and ordered their deep dish/ pan (same thing) and ordered sausage, mushrooms, onions and jalapenos.  It was ready on time and we drove home with the intoxicating smell radiating from the back seat.  I was excited.  It looked amazing and we hung out watching the Bulls game, sitting in our family room and devoured a couple slices.  You had to use a fork and knife... it was quite a meal.  The melted cheesy charred crust, the humongoid sausages, the generous pizza sauce.  It was delicious.  We finally found another deep dish pizza that we enjoy.  The ingredients were fresh and abundant.  Damn Pequods you've redeemed yourself!!!"
"Not that this place needs another review - I still thought I'd add my 2 cents.  Disclaimer: Even though I'm a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I don't eat deep dish or pan pizza.  If I wanted that, I'd get a calzone.  I'm strictly a thin crust girl.  So this review is only for their thin crust.Pequod's is in the top 3 places in the Chicago area for pizza.  (#1 pizza ever is Papa Del's in Champaign).  Their sauce is a little thick, but other than that, the overall package of crust, sauce and toppings is near perfection.  The crust even acts as a little handle for eating!When going, make sure to have a reservation or be prepared to wait.  And put your order in when you check in. I will say the bar staff is less than friendly, and the waiters all seem mostly overwhelmed (but do their best to keep it together), but the place isn't packed every night for the service.Must try for anyone coming to Chicago!"
"You would be really hard-pressed to find better Chicago-style deep dish pizza in the city. There are the classics, like Lou's and Giordano's, but I believe you lose a little something when you start opening up your restaurant in multiples. Pequod's is still unique, and it's in high demand--I recommend putting your name in, and then going next door to the Drinkingbird while you wait, which could be easily be and hour or more. It's close enough so that your buzzer will still go off when your table is ready. Also, avoid going during Blackhawks games or Bulls games--people tend to sit at their tables and extend the wait time even longer than it is already! But then again, IT IS worth the wait!!! :)"
"To me, pizza should be a thin folded thing you eat in the street or a thin thing seared by the flames of brick ovens. What's this pan thing?Pequods is the one deep dish that argues its case well enough with me.  I want everything to arrive in my life in a seasoned iron pan when I eat here.Yeah this location is chaotic, but I always wind up here, and the pizza has always outshone whatever dysfunction was going on with the service.  I'm pretty mellow.  What sells me is how I can chow down on this obviously insane pile of calories and yet never feel rock-in-stomach heavy or gross afterward. That's impressive.The ""Chicago Style"" I bother with consistently, and I've had all the major players."
"LOVE Pequods! Its not an everyday sort of pizza though, its 2 times a day kind of pizza!  The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars:I have this thing about perfect ratios in my pizza - sauce to ingredients to cheese to crust.  (its the same thing with hot dogs)  Pequods is perfect on everything, except for crust.  I am not talking about the caramelized goodness on the outside of the pie, I am talking about the bottom of the pie.  Especially when eaten the 2nd day, the crust is thicker and I have to eat only the top layer of it.  Still, get the largest size, because it is fantastic for leftovers (if you aint thick crust phobic like me) and don't bother with any starters to save room for the real deal."
By far my favorite Pizzeria in Chicago. The ratio of all ingredients is just perfect and the crunch of the cheese and softness of the dough is amazing. I spent a week eating pizza on vacation here and this by far tops the list. They also played some Drake and Hey who doesn't love some Drake and pizza.
"Best deep dish in Chicago, seriously.  Everyone always talks about Lou's, Uno, and Giordano's, but Pequod's is the sleeper pizza of the city.  I must admit I liked the actual restaurant before it burnt down years ago, but the pizza never skips a beat.  Caramelized crust deep dish loaded with fresh sausage, oh yeah.  Before the fire, the dining room always had some metal/rock chosen by the bartenders playing.  Now they just play boring vanilla classic rock, and there's a mural of some lord of the rings BS is the bathroom.  Just miss the old rocker vibe of this place.Aside from that gripe, this place is the best.  The owner is always there making sure everybody is happy and it's run like a well oiled machine.  Plus they play all the Hawks games during hockey season!"
"If you haven't ever eaten at Pequod's, you are really missing out on what I consider the best deep dish in Chicago. I've gotten their pizza delivered as well, and it is definitely better in person. This is always on my recommendations list for out of towners looking for suggested places to eat.My buddy got me into getting a sausage and giardiniera pizza and it is surprisingly really tasty. Their sausage is among the best I've ever tasted on a pizza and the carmelized crust is good enough to convert any of you non-crust-eaters out there. I would say that their pizzas taste better if you don't over do it on the ingredients, so don't go overboard on your toppings. Best go hungry because two pieces will really fill you up.This place can get pretty packed at times, but they've got friendly service and kick ass pizza. Go get some!"
"Don't let Pequod's fly under your deep dish pizza radar!  I love pizza.  I love deep dish pizza, and Pequod's is exceptional.  The crust- the edges are super crispy and kind of carmelized but the bottom is thick and doughy.  The sauce- Pequod's does not skimp on the sauce which I love, and the cheese is gooey and perfectly portioned to the amount of sauce on the pie.  I've eaten in and also had pizzas delivered.  Either way, it is great!  The service is wonderful, and the pizza is truly fantastic."
"My dining experience in Chicago finished off with a deep dish pizza dinner and I was not disappointed at all with choosing Pequod's to end it all.  It was packed because of the Pats vs. Tebow game, but luckily we had a reservation and were seated upstairs.  We had the corner booth to watch the game so I could not have been happier with our seating.  The pizza took a long time to come out, but they warn you of that when you walk in.  They make each pizza to order, which to me is a great thing.  In the end, there is lot worse things that you can do then to talk to company for 30 minutes while you salivate at the thought of some cheesy, doughy, saucy concoction cooking in the oven waiting your disposal.  To be 100% honest, I still prefer NYC pizza, but Chicago pizza was delicious and filling.  2 pies were more than enough for 5 of us (3 guys, 2 girls) and they were both extremely delicious.  Side note: The next morning I went skeet shooting (that's right bitches, I am a skeet shooter too) with a Chicago native and he was very pleased at my choice of Pequod's for the deep dish pizza, so clearly it's a favorite amongst locals as well."
"Don't be discouraged by the exterior run down vibe, this place is a gem for Lincoln park. We built our own pan (deep dish) pizza and loved it. Taste compares to Lou's, which we find to be among the best of deep dishes. If your In the area, come out."
The Big 3 ain't got nothing on Peaquods! Love love love this place!  Best pizza in Chicago hands down!
"My fiance has been on a deep dish kick lately and whenever Friday rolls around he can't help but crave anything else besides this place. We have both been born and bred on Chicago's Deep Dish pizza and have tried them all. I've got to say the pepperoni deep dish here is awesome and is a fierce competitor. Notwithstanding the great pizza, be prepared to WAIT & WAIT & WAIT, especially on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and/or any major basketball & hockey game. This place gets filled to the brim quickly. And while the hosts try to guesstimate as best they can what the wait will actually be they are usually off by a half hour. Either way, once you do get into this place, prepare to stuff yourself.  :)"
"Similar to Lou Malanati's in thickness (quite thick) and cheesiness (same amount as a typical thin crust pizza), Pequod's deep dish is one of Chicago's best. The burnt, cheesy ring around the top is absolutely delicious. High quality ingredients. Great classic feeling wood-paneled interior if you eat in, but no issues with delivery. Becoming one of the most popular ""non-touristy"" deep dish joints in Chicago. And rightfully so. Highly recommend!"
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago...nuff said.
"After eating at The Art of Pizza and hating their deep dish, I was VERY skeptical. I wondered why people from Chicago subject themselves to these doughy monstrosities they call ""pizza."" Didn't they know that better exists? Oh but they do and its called Pequods. And it is AMAZING! It is light and crunchy and the caramelized crust is heaven. I ordered a small thin crust for myself because I was so afraid of the deep dish. But alas all I did was eat deep dish because it was like a drug. Eat here, love it. Tip: it takes about 40 mins to make the pizza, but you can call ahead for dine in or take out."
"There is a constant argument that Chicagoans participate in regarding where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city. Pequod's, hands down, has my vote in this battle. Their pizza is great for delivery too, but if you have the chance stop by one of their locations to indulge in their pizza straight out of the oven I strongly suggest doing so!"
"There's little to add, but I'll just note that this place was founded by Burt Katz, who went on to found Burt's Place up in Morton Grove. If you're not fond of ""traditional"" Chicago style deep dish (I'm not) try this place anyway - the Pequod's/Burt's style is a fantastic, unique twist on Chicago deep dish. Most importantly, this location has pizza that is nearly identical to what you'll find at Burt's - the defining characteristics are the caramelized crust, a thick, cake-like crust, and comparatively thin layer of cheese.The procedure for eating here is not nearly as challenging as it is at Burt's. I've been to this location a number of times and have never had to wait for a table. Also, try the garlic bread. It's incredible."
"I'm lactose intolerant, but I still eat Pequod's. The pain and suffering I endure after each meal is worth every bite and undigested lactose flowing through my intestines. That goes to say a lot for Pequods. Quite possibly the best deep dish you can ask for in Chicago. What differentiates it from other deep dish pizzas is its crust. The caramel brunt crust is so delicious. Just my two cent."
Fantastic pizza. Slow service for a slow lunch. Will absolutely come back.
"With Burt and his eponymous Burt's Place now in retirement, this is definitely the best pizza around."
Really good.I rate the thin tops.I prefer Malnati's barely. This deep is really good and not as touristy.Be prepared for a wait for the pie.
"BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN ALL OF CHICAGO! Yep, I said it and you CANNOT, WILL NOT convince me of otherwise. I don't mind the wait because it's THAT delicious. I love the caramelized cheese crust the best! The sauce is delicious and the variety of toppings are endless. It's just plain orgasmic. They have a great selection of quality beers on tap also, as well as, some tasty apps. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I take all my visitors there when they say that want Chicago deep dish, and anytime I am in the mood for deep dish pizza, I look nowhere else, but here."
"Awesome pizza. Super fresh ingredients, flavorful, not too heavy/greasy."
"After a late show at Lincoln Hall we had a pizza craving. We whipped out the trusty Urban Spoon & wound up at Peaquod's. This place is awesome & uses their well seasoned cast iron pie pans for your pizza. We had just a basic sausage pan & it was just perfect. The center wasn't soggy at all, the crust had great flavor & stayed moist without becoming gummy & the cheese caramelized nice and crispy around the edges of the pan. Being a weeknight around 1am, it was nice & quiet & we had the waitress pretty much all to ourselves. Will def come back/carry out in the future."
"Pequod's brings back those good ole memories when I used to live in Bucktown and used to order on a late night to fulfill my pizza craving and/or after a late night of drinking. For those who need a break from the typical Chicago style deep dish, try Pequod's.  I had this with a friend and she didn't eat the crust and I was like, ""Wth you doing, don't be ridiculous and eat your crust!"" She thought it was burnt and that it was just another piece of crust like all generic pizza crusts. Their caramelized crust is to die for alone, although I'm pretty sure it's not good for your health haha ;( (oh well YOLO) The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and the sauce has a nice tangy taste that isn't overbearing. I usually get jalapenos, pe=pperoni and mushrooms on mine to keep it simple. The jalapenos gives it a nice kick to complement the tanginess of the sauce. There's always a line running down towards Webster so just a heads up for y'all who have special plans afterwards. If you live in the area, delivery is your best bet to avoid long lines or if you're feeling lazy on a Sunday afternoon."
"Mmmmm Pequod's. My favorite Chicago-style pizza yet.The caramelized crust is truly a thing to behold. And I love that the pizza is brought out in a cast iron skillet. It was surprising the first time I went there. The environment isn't too great - very much like a sports bar, with multiple TVs showing multiple sports games - but some people are probably way into that. The waitresses all wear the same (weird) uniform, consisting of shorty-shorts and weird hats (I think?), but that didn't really bother me, although my sister-in-law didn't care for it. But the Pequod's salad was great and perfect to split between four people. We got one 14"" pizza and had two pieces left over to eat later. Delicious as always.And personally, I'm a fan of this place not only for their good food, but also because it isn't full of tourists, which create ridiculous waits."
"5 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the service.  This is probably my favorite pizza in Chicago- I love their sauce and the crust is crispy.  I've ordered it for delivery and dined in, and while the atomosphere is fun delivery is much more reliable if you have a time constraint.  Went here on a Friday night with a reservation but still needed to wait for a table (which is fine, but some indication of how long we'd wait/an apology would have been nice), and our pizza took about an hour an 10 minutes when we were told it would be 40. I understand that it was a busy night, but our server avoided contact with us during that time without any explanation.  I think there may have been some mix-up, which again is fine, but don't ignore us.  Definitely plan on around 2 hours for dinner if you're eating there. It wasn't ideal, but the upstairs part is great and the pizza is worth it."
"My face hurt from too much deliciousness, that's what Pequod's does to you.Deep Dish pizza that no other place in the city can touch.  Well, they can touch it, they just have to pay like the rest of us schmucks.   First off, the crust in caramelized not burnt.  They douse your pizza with toppings, like a sea of peperoni or mountains of sausage. The cheese is stringy and the sauce phenomenal.  Best pizza in the city."
I wouldn't suggest this place to watch a hockey game but the pizza and good is amazing and the staff is great!
"Absolutely incredible. Hands down, the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Uno, Due, Lou Malnati's, Gino's, Giordano's...none compare to Pequod's. The veggies are fresh, sauce is delicious, the building actually has enough seating to accommodate the demand, and the caramelized crust is outstanding. Even the thin crust pizza is good! A must go."
There is something so wonderful about the taste of that browned cheese crust!  It is very addicting.  I love it.
YUM!!!!!  BEST PAN PIZZA IN CHICAGO!!!!Get the pan pizza and you will not regret it.  My wife and I like the pepperoni with garlic and mushroom.  You have to eat here!Get there early if you go for dinner on the weekend because it can get very busy.
"With a not-so-Italian name like ""Pequod's"", I was a little apprehensive when agreeing to go to this pizza place.  In my mind I was really craving a quality Chicago pie, so I was afraid of discovering yet another ""fluffy"" pizzeria. (Screw the organic dough, fresh arugula, roasted pine nuts - I like REAL ingredients on my pizza!) The deep dish was delish. Go for the sausage: forkful crispy bites with just the right amount of spice. As an added bonus, they have Peroni on tap! Hellooooo pitchers... Everything about this deep dish style pizza is great - one of Chicago's best!"
Best Deep dish Pizza in the CHI!
"Yes, you have to wait 40 minutes to get your food. Is it worth it? Absolutely! The crust on this pizza is the most amazing thing that will ever hit your mouth. I am a simple pizza eater so I can only speak on behalf of the cheese and pepperoni pizzas, but i'm sure any other options would be just as amazing. This is my favorite pizza spot in Chicago, and I will continue to talk all of my out of town friends/family to this location to get a true Chicago pizza experience."
"Pan pizza was amazing, messy and extremely fresh. Regarding the food, I would highly recommend it. Be prepared for a wait, but that's expected with fresh food. However, the service was absolutely terrible. Everyone was very nice, but the table service was beyond slow. And I mean slow. I'm a patient person, but after ordering only 1 pizza and it taking 70 minutes to come and THEN waiting 20 minutes for the check, I almost lost it. I would probably never come back and try a new place."
I'd heard so many good things about the pizza here so after a movie I had to see what the fuss was all about. It definitely was a popular place to be on a weekday evening. The pizza was delicious (and filling). The sauce was amazing!
"Growing up as one of 5 children, my parents taught us never to waste food. Anything that was burnt was to be eaten anyway. Probably because it was your fault you didn't pay attention to it. To this day, I love a good piece of burnt toast. I love burnt cheese even morePequod's, thank you for drawing inspiration from my messed up childhood.This is one of the best deep-dish pizzas in Chicago. Actually, in the Deep Dish Pizza Tasting I did with my friends, Pequod's won.The carmelized crust is so delicious it should be criminal. Crispy crust with burnt cheese. Oh, man... It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.You MUST order the sausage pizza. I'm not usually a sausage kind of gal (The kind made from pork! Get your minds out of the gutter!), but Pequod's has converted me with their pepper-y, flavorful, the-other-white-meat goodness. We also ordered a pepperoni and green pepper pizza (a.k.a. the best pizza topping combination of all time). It was the perfect meat-to-veggie ratio, and the peppers me feel like I was being healthy despite the 1,000,000 grams of carbs I inhaled without a second thought.2 pieces will be plenty per person, but leftovers are encouraged because you will not be able to stop thinking about it by lunch the next day and will want more. Take this psychological fatty's word for it."
"I'm visiting a friend in South Bend and he was nice enough to take us to Chicago.  I asked him if he could please take us to Pequod's since it had so many reviews and I love love love pizza.  Hands down, the best deep dish pizza ever.  I loved it.  The service was good too.  I even bought a shirt!  I love these hole in the wall pizza places.  They are the best.  I can only hope of coming here again."
"YUMTASTIC!! Have always ordered deep dish, they smother the pizza with the toppings of your choice and it is just heaven in your mouth. The crust has a personality, it doesn't even need the rest of the pizza and thats how good it is. Ordered by deliver most of the time because its always packed on the weekends..rightfully so. I think I need a slice now!!"
"As a Chicago native, I've tried just about all the mainstream pizza this city has to offer and Pequod's is definitely high on the list.  Luckily they are close by and in delivery range, otherwise, it might could be a trek depending on where you live (although I think they have an outpost in the northern burbs).  I always order a deep dish with garlic with some randomn combination of veggies.  I do notice the pizza seems a little bland w/o the garlic, imo.  Not to heavy on the cheese, which makes this pizza a little lighter than most deep dish, and as many have mentioned before, the caramelized crust is really delicious and unique to Pequod's - they have it down pat!If your hankerin' for some chi-town pizza, give Pequod's a go!"
In my top 3 pizza spots!!! Great pizza! I can go on for a long time telling you all the great things about this spot. It's a must for pizza lovers. Period.
personally the best deep dish in chicago in my opinion. the crust is just perfect!great customer service and definitely worth the drive up just to eat here. love coming here and only wish they had a location closer to me so i could make it a regular spot.
"Ive been going here for years and grew up near the original one in Morton Grove.  Pizza is great and one of my favorites.  There is too much bread so I order extra cheese and that helps (why my rating is only 4 stars).  Twice the pizza has come out burnt, so they need to work on their consistancy (both times it was very busy).  Def ""Barry RECOMMENDED."""
"6 of us sat down and we simultaneously took our first bite and looked at each other in unison and thought, ""Damn!""Amazing pizza. The crust is awesome and it's not a deep dish, it's a pan-crust, but a little thicker. Good stuff, I think it's my favorite of all the Chicago establishments I've been to so far."
"It had been years since I'd been to Pequod's. I don't know why I waited so long. The deep dish pizza is good and the beer list is good as well. The space can get extremely crowded, but being there a little off-hours is makes more a more comfortable experience. They make the cheese perfectly burned around the edge of the pie, and the crust is crunchy. If you're a vegetarian, I'm curious if they use lard or not. Friend appetizers are OK. Don't get me wrong, fried anything is good, but they appear to prefrozen fried items. The pizza is definitely the highlight."
"Given the number of reviews, I don't feel the need to elaborate any further than affirming that Pequod's has fantastic deep dish pizza; having tried all the major joints in Chicago (Uno, Duo, Lou's, Giordano's, Gino's, etc.), this is easily my favorite.  There's just something about that crust!  I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere (a little too dark and noisy for my taste), and my plate came with a little something extra that the dishwashers missed, but the solid service and delicious pizza will keep me coming back!As a side note, Pequod's pizzas seems to use less cheese than many other deep dish staples (the crust is thicker), so you might want to consider ordering with extra cheese.  It's excellent as is, but if you prefer a little crust with your cheese, keep this in mind!"
I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza which is the only reason I left 4 stars. The toppings were great and from what I hear it's some of the best Chicago style pizza you can get in the city. Very laid back place and the wait staff is very friendly.
"I'm a self proclaimed pizza savant, and this is my go to place for deep dish. Best pepporoni pizza you will eat in your lifetime.The carmalized crust is the real deal. The burnt parts on the top of the crust? Oh my is it delicious. And the great part about not having an overly-cheesy pizza? The left-overs you eat the next day for lunch still taste amazing!I've taken countless out of town friends/family here, and I've only had two people say they've had better pizza before. Unfortunately for me, those are my future in-laws. Not quite enough to end an engagement... but close! :-).Every person who eats pizza owes it to themselves to try Pequod's!"
"Before moving to Chicago I never liked pizza. In fact, I was that weirdo that ate the toppings, pulled off the cheese (and threw it away), and then ate the bread and sauce.  After a LOT of hounding from my friends to try this place, I finally caved, and I'm so glad that I gave in.  The crust is phenomenal and I am now a true fan of all things Pequod's.  Sure, there will be long lines and a wait if you go during prime dinner time on Friday and Saturday night, but it is definitely worth it."
"Best pizza I've ever had, well worth the wait. Deep dish, extra sauce and garlic. Amazing!"
"Very good pizza, people make best pizza claims, but I would say it is in the top 3 deep dish. It's tough to crown number 1."
I was the girl who went to Home Run Inn since i was a kid and then got into giordanos connies etc and as of lately Lou Malnatis. I thought i tasted the best of the best in pizza but boy was i wrong. This place is beyond amazing. I was super skeptical before coming my boyfriend raved about it but the minute i tasted this delicious pie ive never looked back. every time i meet someone whos new to the city or visiting i always tell them this is the go to place.
I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't give this place 5 stars. Malnati's shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence. There is a reason it's 4 stars overall and not 1 or 2 like some peoples' reviews suggest. They're probably bitter or their tastebuds are non -existent.
"I know Chicago folks go on and on about Chicago style pizza, it's great if that's what you're looking for, but this place is amazing. It's all about the crust. We always tell people about this place because it's AMAZING!!! Go here for amazing pizza at an even more amazing price."
"Simply the best. Sausage, Pepperoni and Garlic pan pizza. Dang I love visiting Chicago. Do not forget the cheese sticks."
Mmmm Pequod's!  Their carmelized deep dish crust is freaking amazing.  Their pies are huge and packed with equally huge ingredients.  If you're going to get any topping I highly recommend the sausage...big tasty chunks that will have you drooling as soon as the delivery guy knocks at your door.  Definitely at the top of my best Chicago pizza list!
"Sorry, this is simply the best pizza in Chicago.  Period, end of paragraph.  Don't even try with those other shops.  You can't match the crust, the toppings and the sauce.  Don't try.  Tourists, do yourself a favor and take a 5 minute cab ride to Lincoln Park and get the best pizza in Chicago, ergo, possibly the best pizza in the world!"
"Oh, you know, I've only been to Chicago a gazillion times now and have never tried deep dish pizza.  My friends were not only appalled and confused, but did everything in their power to change this.  When my friend said that Pequod's is his favorite Chicago pizza, I trusted his judgment and now I know why.The crust is perfect.  I was expecting some doughy, yeasty monstrosity.  Not even close - the crust is much more porous than I expected, slightly caramelized, and crispy.  I also liked that the tomato sauce had a little bit of tartness to it, rather than the sweet or overly salty stuff that is so often slopped on top of pizza crust.  There was plenty of cheese, yet the structural integrity of the pizza was not compromised.  In summary, all of the ingredients are tasty AND in proportion.Although this was a great slice of Chicago pizza, NY pizza will always reign supreme.** I am ready to start 2011 with death threats from pro-Chicago pizza Yelpers."
"Came out to Pequod's for a long overdue date night with the Mrs.  It had been a long time since I last visited and they haven't changed one bit.  We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday and we were told we had a 10-15 minute wait.  We were seated in less than 5.  Our waitress was great - always making sure we were taken care of.  We ordered a non-deep dish pizza (a crime at Pequods, I know) and it came out rather quickly.  Everything was great and we'll return soon!"
"Flew from Vancouver to Chicago for Blackhawks and pizza. Was told a few options and this is by far the winner, amazeballs and as big of portions as it was rumored. I'll be back."
"One of these days I will get on yelp to write a bad review but its definitely not going to be today.  Peqods Pizza is the BEST. That's all there is to it.  The caramelized crust is unbelievable, the service is friendly, and I looove their toppings.  I'm not usually a big sausage person when it comes to pizza but theirs is amazing.Hands down best deep dish in the pizza, nuff said."
"Five stars. This pizza is excellent!! I grew up in Chicago and I'll tell you, I would take this place any day over Lou's,Gino's or Uno's.  Just outstanding and consistent. Now keep in mind I always take it out, I've never sat down for dinner although we did have a party upstairs for my God daughters baptism and that worked out nicely as well."
"One of my all-time favorite pizza places ever!  This is by far the best deep dish pizza in Chicago!  I've tried so many different deep dish pizzas around town and all others just seem mediocre.  Once I tried Pequod's there was no going back!  I only let myself eat Pequods on special occasions, like after a triathlon or something, otherwise I would eat it ALL THE TIME!  It's the thing I look forward to the most after a race, because then I can eat all the pizza I want!  Hands down, best pizza in Chicago!"
Some of the best pizza that can be found anywhere -- deep dish and thin slice -- but some the worst wine. I love just about everything but their wine. The red blend tasted like syrup and the Zinfandel was not much better. Love to see them get a cheap chianti and or a Tempranillo on their list.
"BEST deep dish pizza I've tried in Chicago so far (comparison points = Gino's and Lou Malnati's).  The secret is the seasoned pans they use for the pizzas - they line each pan with parmesan cheese so when you get the pizza out, there's a delicious ring of semi-burnt cheese around the outside of the crust.  Absolutely amazing.It's definitely worth the wait in my opinion and any time I am in the mood for some deep dish, Pequod's is my first choice!"
If i could give this place 10 starts I would!!! I'm obsessed...by far THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO HANDS DOWN!!!listen to me right now...order this and only this when you go to Pequods:GROUND BEEF (of Sausage if you're a sausage fan) - and Giardinera on a Deep Dish Pizza.  You will thank me later. I LOVE THIS PLACE...and I miss it bc now I live in LA and the deep dish here blows!!
"After hearing about this place from some of my co-workers, I decided to check it out on my day off from work. Thank you, President's Day! I took advantage of the Lunch Special which is a 7in. pan pizza with one topping and a drink for $5. The establishment was nice and clean and the pizza was good. Crust had a nice char along the outer edge and the tomato sauce complimented the other ingredients. I would have preferred a bit more cheese, but overall it is a very good pizza. NOTE: This is not deep dish pizza because the ingredients are on top, instead of being layered under the cheese."
"The pizza has the best crust! Service is a little slow, but its still a great place to bring the whole family! Its a different take on deep dish. One of my favorites! They also have some of the best ranch dressing in the city!!"
The best Chicago style pizza in the city! That carmelized crust is to die for. One critique is go in for it don't get delivery because the crust is too bready
Burnt Butter Crust Pizza. the GOOD kind. all you need to know.
"My love affair with Pequod's began on a snowing Tuesday in January at the corner booth upstairs.  After getting several recommendations, it was time to give it a try.  The restaurant was maybe half full.  As soon as our party arrived the waitress came over, took our order and we were on our way.  The service was great and everything came in an appropriate amount of time.Obviously everyone comes here for the pizza.  We ordered two deep dish, one with pepperoni and mushroom and another with onion and green pepper.  The caramelized crust is really was gives the pizza it's edge.  Both pizzas were excellent but I felt that the one with meat on it had a leg up, it was just more savory.  I will be going back to add sausage to that onion and green pepper pizza though.Moderate selection of beers.  I did see on the menu that they offer a lunch special of a 7"" pizza and a drink (pop or miller lite) for $5.  That's a steal - who wants to go grab lunch?"
"Best pizza in Chicago!! That's right. I said it!Seriously, this pizza is amazing. The carmelized crust in unlike any other crust I have ever tasted.Make sure you get the deep dish! :)"
Pizza was delicious.  Not salty or buttery or greasy. I'd say probably in my top 3 favorite pizza places. Restaurant is nice n cozy. Staff is quick and friendly.  Will come back.
"i'm not a fan of deep dish pizza - but hey, when in chicago, do as all other tourists do and give it  a try, right?this place came as a rec over the usual spots, so we gave it a try. i got mine loaded with meat and it really was delish! there is a downstairs and upstairs and super casual spot. would be fun to catch a game there over some beers and pizza. i'd recommend it even as a non deep-dish lover!"
"LUNCH SPECIAL - $4.95 for 7"" personal pan pizza + 1 topping + pint glass of Bud Light.  I still think Lou's deep dish is tastier because of the tomato sauce, but WHAT A DEAL!  The restaurant is clean, and the service is decent at this location, too.  I think the rush is around 12:30pm.I'm going to have to make a ""You Can't Afford NOT To"" List."
"There's not much more that I can say about Pequod's pizza besides what my lovely Yelp Elite wife Kristy K penned in her love letter to Pequod's disguised as a Yelp review.  But at the risk of being repetitive, here we go.  Pequod's pan pizza is the best pizza in Chicago.  Forget about the ""big three"" Chicago-style pizzerias: Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's East.  None can compare to the glory of Pequod's.  In fact, Pequod's pan pizza is without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had in my life. My go-to order from Pequod's is a pan pizza with pepperoni and basil.  The deep dish crust at Pequod's is unlike any other crust ever:  thick, crispy, and chewy lined with caramelized cheese that adds a perfect crisp of cheesy goodness.  This caramelized cheese became a delicacy for my wife and we had to incorporate a ""slice draft"" by which took turns drafting slices of pizza to get the ones with the optimal caramelization.  Pequod's uses pans that are decades old, which I am convinced must somehow infuse decades of delicious spices and flavor into the crust of the pizza.  The pizza sauce at Pequod's is a mix of sweetness and spiciness with a delightfully fresh herbal component.  The cheese is fantastic.  And the pepperoni is phenomenal.  Unlike other pizzerias where you might get soggy flimsy pepperoni, Pequod's roasts their pepperoni before putting them on the pizza so that they become crispy, which creates a beautiful textural contrast with the melty cheese and sauce on top while pairing with the crisp bottom crust and outer caramelized cheese.  When you put all of these elements together, the greatest pizza of all-time is born.  When I talked to my friends back in Chicago, it always shocked me to find so many people who had never tried Pequod's.  What is wrong with you people!?!   Since moving from Chicago a year ago, the one single thing that I have missed more than anything in all of Chicago is Pequod's pizza.  There is no other pizza like it anywhere!  If you live in Chicago and have not had Pequod's, you are hurting me.  Just knowing that you could pick up the phone until 4 am and have a piping hot Pequod's pizza delivered to your doorstep -- but haven't -- while I simultaneously would do just about anything for that same pleasure and delight just crushes my soul.  For me (and for yourself), give Pequod's pizza a try.  Then again, if I had never tried Pequod's, then perhaps I would not be living the desperate existence that I am now:  pining for a pizza 1,000 miles away with no hope of finding a decent replacement.  All I know is that when I visit Chicago next time I am taking a cab directly from ORD to Pequod's.  I love you Pequod's and miss you more than you'll ever know (unless you read this review, I guess)."
"Delicious pizza (especially the crust) but horrible, awful service! From placing the carry out order over the phone to picking it up, nothing but frustration and annoyance. Even though the food was good, I will never go back because it was such a hassle. The girl on the phone was preoccupied and couldn't get my name right (even after saying it 5 times and spelling it 3). Their carry out system is the WORST! I had to wait over ten minutes in their over crowded tiny restaurant! I was trying to avoid that anxiety by ordering carry out! And then they gave me the wrong appetizer when the receipt clearly read ""jalapeño poppers"". Incompetent and lazy staff. If the ""runner"" for carry out had shown an inch of hustle, I would have been more forgiving. But seriously, she walked and moved slower than my 86 year old grandmother. Sad, because this place has the potential for being the best deep dish in Chicago......"
first time having chicago style pizza IN chicago and this place did not disappoint!!
"Took about 10 minutes to get a seat, which was good considering how busy they were.  Nice ambiance, good crowd but not too loud.  Longer wait to get our pizzas, two large deep dish.  Toppings were great but the crust was slightly doughy.  Overall I give the place 4 stars."
"This is the place me and my friends go to meet and catch up on each other's lives. We've been going there for years. Love their pizza (my favorite is their deep dish, with pepperoni and pineapple, yummy) and a great place to hang out, talk and share some pichers of beer. They have some nice looking wait stuff, too. :)"
"My favorite pizza place in Chicago. Very lucky they don't deliver too far north or I'd be in serious trouble. This pizza is unlike any other and if you're a fan of thick crust and extra thick cheese without sauce...this is not for you.The dough is lighter crunchier, chewier with a good layer of cheese some might call light and just the right amount of sauce; big on taste and that caramelized cheese...wow."
"The most delicious, caramelized crust deep dish has ever boasted!  I am not a deep-dish kind of pizza gal, but Pequod's executes it perfectly.  It is the perfect answer for a chilly, Chicago evening.  Try their pepperoni & basil pie (mushrooms are a good addition too).  The fresh basil really compliments their nearly-perfect sauce.  Pequod's really has no competition in Lincoln Park for the perfect pie.  It is in a class of its own.Hint: if you're ordering in, ask for them to NOT cut the pie prior to delivery/pick-up.  It keeps all the coveted juices inside."
hands down- the best deep dish in town!
really good pie.  people go a little too crazy with the hype but it gets the job done.
"Questioned the recommendation of a friend that Pequod's was one of the best pizzeria's in Chicago. She was right, this place is great. Our mushroom and sausage pizza was excellent.  Would recommend this to all pizza lovers."
Went here last night with some friends before we went to Webster place for a movie. Their deep dish pizza is really good. One of my favs that I have had in Chicago. We also tried a small thin crust cheese pizza and it wasn't nearly as good as the deep dish.I recommend trying this place out. You should definitely have a reservation though. We did have a reservation and so did not have to wait long. There was definitely a long line of people waiting for tables though.
"This has become the pizza that I crave all the time. For a few weeks we would order it every Sunday night. The crust is amazing, the sauce is perfect, and the italian sausage is homemade. If you have not tried this place you need to and it will soon surpass every other pizza place in the city."
This pizza has been one of my favorites in Chicago! The crust is so good. It is a little burnt but it's so good. The pizza does take a long time for delivery but it is worth it!
Omg! The BEST deep dish pizza ever. And I don't even like pizza that much. I have been bringing friends here for years. It's a hidden gem. I get excited when others actually tell me pequods is their favorite and not the tourist places like giordanos. The lunch special is amazing. A personal pizza and beverage for $5. Id eat there every day if it weren't frowned upon in society ;)
"Call me Ishmael.Or don't.  Whatever you call me - I am all filled-up and blubbery after eating here last night.  This pizza is INSANELY delicious.  I am a total thin cruster but the pan pizza here is divine.  Some of the spiciest and finest pepperoni I have encountered in a while.  What is up with the crust?  It is a bunch of caramelized crispy goodness!   It took a while to get our pie but it was well worth the wait.  Pequod's may look like a hole from the street but once inside, I found it to be Moby-Dick's-belly-like cozy.  I will jump back on your boat, Peaquod's!  You betcha!"
"Very good crust, overall presentation nicely done. Pepperoni tasted good. Sauce was lacking a little sweetness but as a whole a good pizza! The pan crust is the way to go. I would recommend to try."
Love the pan pizza! They sprinkle cheese in the crust before they bake it so it caramelizes into crunchy goodness. The lines are long but worth the wait. Be forewarned...this is deep dish pizza so it takes 45 minutes to bake but you can't rush perfection!
The carmelized crust is what makes Pequod's stand out. It angers me if I go with someone and he or she discards the crust.
"Great pan pizza.  My friend hates when I use this analogy, but I would say it is like a  very very good pizza.  Only as that is the style of za.  It is wayyy better than an actual pizza hut.  They have a great selection of beers on tap and you can create your pizza however you like.  The topping are really fresh and good!  My favorite is pepperoni with jalapeños."
"I have tried many of the 2 thousand pizza places in this city.  Pequods is my only true favorite pizza place in Chicago to date. Super-tasty toppings, perfectly tang/tart thick and chunky red sauce, and 20+ year old cast iron pizza dishes seasoned to burn just the sides of your deep dish cheese crust: they just simply work! Don't bother with the thin crust...that would be a waste of your time and pizza.  That said, I've eaten here over 30 times...you should too."
"Pequod's is delicious. I am not typically a fan of the deep dish, but they do really well with it here. If you have to do deep dish (like when your out of town relatives come to visit and have to have it), this is the place to go. The beer list is OK too. I'd recommend calling ahead to put your name in. They don't take reservations, but they do preferred seating so your name moves to the top of the list when your party arrives. Otherwise the wait times can be a little excruciating. I've tacked off a star for the service. In all of the times I've been here I've had to nearly stand on my chair to get our servers attention. I'll still visit you though Pequod's."
"We ordered Pequod's on a whim, after passing by it earlier in the day. It was a Saturday night and we were told it would take about 1.5 hours to get delivered. It pleasantly arrived quicker, about 1 hour after I placed the order. We were boring and got a plain cheese thin crust. I was obsessed with the sauce and the crust. The sauce was sweet and tomato-y and the crust was still thick, even though it was thin crust pizza. Based on our experience, this will be a great delivery option among the many pizza places in Chicago!"
"I'm late to the party with Pequods, but this place is YUMMY! I'm not sure if you can even compare it to Gino's or Lou's, but it's great in its own way. The crust is great and the pizza is hearty and fresh. Our server was friendly and kept our drinks full, even know the place was packed. We also went with the fried zucchini and it was outstanding. This is a great pre-movie dinner spot."
"Chicago Pizza!  The place looked really popular and felt cozy.  They had sports going on and the beers looked tempting, but I decided to pass on drinking at noon.We got a deep dish and a thin crust just to try both...besides why choose.  The thin crust was reallie thin and crispy.  The cheese is not really greasy which I think points to good cheese.  We got basil and pepperoni on the thin crust and there was pepperoni all over the pizza.  Sweetness.Ok so the deep dish was pretty awesome.  Again it's not too oily which is a win.  The crust looks black, but that's just delicious parmesan goodness.  When they bake the pizza they layer the pan with parmesan cheese so it makes another thin layer of crispy/chewy cheese.  The toppings we used were sausage, bell peppers, and mushrooms.  The sausage was really good.  For those that like to eat pizza with ranch I'm told they make an awesome ranch sauce inhouse here.We also got a salad here...needed something green.  But what?  The salads here also come with pepperoni!  Wow...so win."
"Tried their sausage and fresh basil thin crust pizza.  The biggest difference I noticed that sets their pizza apart from others was the cheese.   Soo good.  And the sausage was tasty as always.  The basil I can't really comment on because they mostly forgot it initially and gave me a ton extra to put on top.  Honest mistake and they quickly and happily corrected it, but it's not the same uncooked.The place is also waay bigger than it seems.  There were two second floor seating areas and there was still a 45 minute wait (totally worth it).  They have a bar, so waiting isn't too bad.I would STRONGLY suggest putting in your order ahead of time.  You can actually call ahead, but I put my order in as soon as I started waiting in line.  Makes everyone happy.  They get their table back quicker and you get your awesome pizza asap.I'd definitely recommend Pequod's!"
I knew that I would love this place just for the fact that their sign is a whale with a thong on its head.  What's not to love about that? But the pizza was yummy and it's close to the movie theater so it's a great place to eat before/after the movies.  Really want to come here for their lunch special which I heard rocks but difficult for me since I work in the loop.  They're also open late which is ideal for those late night pizza cravings.
"This is my absolute favorite pizza. If you don't like deep dish pizza, you'll probably hate this. Because, it is everything that deep dish pizza claims to be. I would take a job cleaning homeless people's feet, if I got paid in Pequod's pizza.... I guess I could just work for money, and spend it on Pequod's. But, that would create one more step in converting my currency to what really matters in life... The best f...ing pizza in the world! I even love hearing people complain that their pizza was burnt. Hahaha. No. It's caramelized goodness that an angel brought back from her last trip to heaven. The sauce is a little sweet, and the cheese is made from the milk of the ""holy cow"" that Harry Carry was always talking about. This is Chicago. And, this is its pizza."
Delivery drags even though I live three blocks away. Pan pizza with carmelized onions and pepperoni is amazing. Pan pizza over thin crust here. Great sports bar. Love that it's open late!
"We went here to try out some deep dish for the first time since moving to Chicago. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this place is two stories with plenty of room for everyone. For starters, the Pequod Salad is delicious with plenty of fresh veggies and cheese slices cut into the shape of fish. I don't know why they're cut into the shape of fish, but it was cute. The salad is plenty big for two people to share. The deep dish, or pan, pizza was amazing! We split a small one between the two of us, and we were both stuffed when we left. It's a build your own cheese pizza, and we added sausage and spinach to it. The best part about the pizza was the crust. It was the perfect crust. Add in the friendly, quick staff and you have an excellent pizza place!"
"This pizza will give you a heart attack and you can literally eat 2 slices and go straight into food coma, but it's the best pan pizza I've had since moving to Chicago. Enough said? Representing Sheffield Neighbors well..."
Greatest lunch special ever!  Personal pizza and a beer/pop for $5!  The pizza was delicious and the beer was nice and chilled.  The service was very friendly and quick; you could definitely be in and out on your 30 minute lunch break.  One of the best deals in town!
"From the outside, I was scared to enter... 90's awning, dirty...But I'm glad I did!! It was such a cool atmosphere with brick walls and a sports bar feeling. We had the cheesy garlic bread and pepperoni pan pizza and had to catch a movie within 1 hour.  They made it happen! The food is amazing and super flavorful and service was great!!"
Worth the (long) wait. Go there when you think you might be hungry since you'll get the food by the time you're starving! Sausage and pepperoni deep dish with some cheesy bread is the ultimate meal!!
So incredibly good - it is definately a treat!  On the heavy side so couldn't order weekly.  People should know that the pizzas take a long time.  I thought it said it on the menu or it used to.  We walked in on a Sunday night around 6:30 - it was packed - but we still managed to get seated within 15 minutes.  We put our order in right away but it was a good 45 minutes - which we expected.  I watched 2 different tables get upset - one took their appetizers to go and cancelled the zaa and the other table just left.  What a mistake because their pan pizza is the best!
"From the outside the place doesn't look very appealing. However, the inside is very nice. Has the sports bar feeling. Garlic cheese bread was awesome! Soft and flavorful. Their fries look similar to McDonald's fries, but taste much better. The pan pizza with the caramelized crust was unbelievable! The sauce and cheese meshes well together on top of the bread. Additionally, I love how the bottom of the bread is seasoned and juicy. My wife really enjoys the thin crust pizza. However, I still prefer the pan pizza.My favorite toppings are sausage, pepperoni, and basil. I'm craving their pizza as I write this review.They are open until 2am so its a great late night spot. Also, if you order their garlic cheesy bread make sure to order marinara sauce as it doesn't come with the dish.  Pequod's pizza is a true taste of Chicago pizza!"
"I will admit, I am a newbie to real Chicago-style pizza but this was the best pizza I've ever had. I could eat just the crust. I'm waiting to try some of the other Chicago spots to compare but this was a great place to start"
"SO glad John, with the Chicago Pizza Tour, decided to put Pequod's on the list during our visit! Out of all the place's we tried, I would have Pequod's any day! It's the only slice I actually finished. MMMM.... The burnt cheesy crust? Crazy good. Plus, it was the only place with Blue Moon on tap. Definitely made me happy after searching for it all day. I understand the whale, but is that a thong on it's head? Why? Maybe we'll go try out Burt's Place today, we'll see how/if it differs =)Thanks, Burt!"
"The whole family went to Pequod's for lunch today (Sat) around 12:45.  We found a place to park without any problems and walked to the restaurant.  It isn't as big as I thought it would be, although there is an upstairs that we didn't see.  It is pretty dark but I thought it had a lot of character with the brick walls, open to the street seating and the lighting. We were seated immediately in a booth at the back.  Our server got to our table about a minute later and took our drink order.  Their draft beer selection isn't too exciting but they had a few Goose Island brews along with Great Lakes so we were a-ok.  We ordered cheesy garlic bread to start.  They brought it out after maybe 10 mins so it wasn't too bad.  You pretty much get 2 decent size pieces.  We just cut each in half and enjoyed.  It was very cheesy and had great crisp, almost burnt ends.  They were the best part!!!  We ordered a large pan sausage and pepperoni.  It did take about 20 mins which wasn't a big deal.  It is fun to people watch and they have tv's scattered throughout.  The pizza was very good.  It is thick with lots of toppings.  The crust was awesome!! We will go back.  It's in a fun, busy neighborhood with lots of other places to visit nearby."
"I like Pequod's. We went again for the second time recently and I liked it much better than the first time I had it. The crust was very crispy, the dough was not too doughy, and it had the perfect amount of toppings, cheese, and sauce. It's a great place to stop and split a pizza with friends before a movie. I can't say I'd drive over here to eat it, though. It's good and I am a fan...but not a fanatic. Skip the small salad and the creamy garlic dressing. It's blah, with 1,000 black olives, 1 slice of a Roma tomato, and 1 tablespoon of shredded carrots. The creamy garlic dressing tasted like sour cream with garlic powder mixed in. We should've split the fried zucchini. :( Oh well, lesson learned. I'm not sure why people refer to this as deep dish - it's not. It's pan pizza, it even says so on their menu. If you want deep dish pizza, don't come here. If you want great pan pizza, come here. We've never had a wait during the week, but we usually go to 7pm movies and get here around 5:30. When we do head out, I see only about 1 or 2 tables open, I can only imagine how nuts it is on the weekend. Great place to stop before heading over to the movie theater."
"I don't often say this - but I LOVE my brother. Yes, purely because he insisted that I go to Pequod's... it is BY FAR the best advice he has ever given me in his life. My friends and I made the trek over here on my brother's word alone. Yes, we were running later then we wanted to be for a show uptown more, yes it was freezing cold and raining, and yes we were having trouble finding a cab and ended up walking the whole way. and YES IT WAS WORTH IT. When we first walked into the place I thought we would be waiting for hours, but they lead us upstairs and all the way to the other end of the restaurant and sat us immediately. We explained we were in a bit of a hurry and the waitress did great bringing us all our drinks quickly and getting our order in - even with it being packed! They had a great beer list (something that is very important to me) and also had a pretty great special on a shot of whiskey with a beer - can't go wrong there! The pizza is absolutely delish! All the ingredients so fresh and the best sausage I think I've ever had on a pizza. The warm gooey cheesey meaty combination made the walk in the freezing rain a distant memory and all my troubles were gone. Yes. Its that good. The sauce? Phenomenal! the crust being made partially out of caramelized cheese??? ohhhhh my goodness! My advice is not to get anything bigger then a medium because it is SO filling. We couldn't really take it with us either because we didn't want to take it around to all the bars that night - it was pretty heartbreaking. A medium would have easily fed 4 people - we had two four the for of us (mostly because one of us was a vegetarian and we didn't want to miss out on this heavenly sausage -  but still two smalls would have been more then fine!). I saw that someone wrote so not worth the wait. I know I didn't have to wait at all (thank goodness because we would have had to leave), but I would not be angry to wait an hour or two for this goodness! Get a drink while you wait and dream of the pizza that will be in your belly in the near future."
"It was the boyfriend's birthday last weekend and we had lengthy conversations about where to head to dinner.  Our ultimate conversation went like this:BF: ""I recently decided where I want to go to dinner.  I can't remember though...""Goes silent as he is deep in thought.Me: ""Is it Pequod's?""  {I know this man and he loves his pizza.}BF: Shakes his head... still thinking.BF: ""I know!  I want to go to Pequod's.""Me: Ah ha!Our visit did not disappoint, either.  We had a sausage and green pepper pizza and it was amazeballs.   Pequod's has such tasty pizza, due in large part to the fresh ingredients and the caramelized cheese on top.  It is simply delicious.On this visit we were surprised to learn that Pequod's has an ENORMOUS upstairs dining room.  Seriously - it's huge.  It doesn't get much better than Pequod's.  Yum."
"Be still my heart, this is by far the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.  No other words needed other than sausage and green peppers.  Antipasti salad is pretty delicious too - extra points for the cheese cut into a whale shape."
"THE best spot that offers Chicago Style deep dish...no joke! And what's so special about this place is their caramelized butter crust. There are hundreds of pizzarias around Chicago and their burbs but none offer the caramelized butter crust that Pequod's does.Fresh toppings, AWESOME lunch menu ($5 for a personalized pizza?!), great selection of drinks (mainly beer), and great customer service. All of the times I have gone there has always been a wait so come early if you're impatient and starving. (=MUST TRY!!!!!! Even if you're not a big pizza fan."
Went for lunch and was a bit disappointed at the service.  40 min wait kind of sucks if you live here.  Pizza was great though....
"YESPequods is the place for DEEP DISH. for out-of-towners in search of the ""famous"" chicago style pizza, GO HERE. forget giordano's or uno or where-ever. those places make some nasty pie-like pizza, all disproportional with so much cheese you'll be blocked up the rest of your time in chi. trust me, i'm giving you the wisdom i acquired via trial and tribulation. THIS IS THE PLACE"
"So I saw this place on the food network on ""the best Dayum takeout"" I just had to try it! OMG As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a vivacious host. I'm new to the area so I was stoked to try the deep dish pizza. The pizza was very delicious and all that I had imagined it would be. The carmelized crust was the icing on the pizza. I will definately be back for more of that deep dish pizza!!"
"Yum yum yum!!! Seriously the best pizza ever! There is always a wait on the weekends so I recommend going on a weekday, or wait because it's totally worth it! Staff is always nice and quick too which is a plus. Their pan pizza is the best but the thin is still really good as well."
Went here because a movie was sold out across the street. Amazing deep dish. I thought it was better than Lou Malnatis. The lunch special is a personal pizza and a bud light for $5.
"I have only lived in Chicago for half a year, and in the south suburbs for a year before that, but I've visited friends here for longer, and this is our go-to place.  It is also where I take people who visit Chicago and want deep-dish pizza.  In the rare cases where they don't want deep-dish pizza, I use enhanced interrogation techniques on them until they do, then I take them to Pequod's.This pizza never fails to make me happy.  I learned to love giardiniera here, and I learned to love caramelized cheese crusts here.  The non-caramelized crust parts are also great, as is the sauce (some of my friends say it's on the sweet side, but I love it).  Their salads are great too, but that's not the point.  Go here.  Eat the deep dish.  Become happier.  If you can, try the lunch special.  It's one of the best food deals anywhere."
"Great casual neighborhood joint, I love sitting at the tables up front when we can get them, tasty pizza, good service, everyone's friendly.  We usually get the thin crust pizza, which trust me, is a substantial tasty crust, and get half/half of different toppings, since I love everything on it, but the others don't like mushrooms or onions."
"Best goddamn pizza in all of Chicago.  Let's face it.  When you come to Chicago, you are looking for the deep dish and these guys got it right.  While I know it's supposed to be all about the sausage, I'm still a huge peperoni fan.  We always get the peperoni and sausage combo and order a large hoping that there will be some left over to save for later.  The pizza crust is more like a pie having just the right amount of crispness and sweetness.  They've got a descent selection of beers from Goose Island, Half Acre, and some other midwest favorites."
"This place is by far the best pizza in Chicago. I've eaten in once and I've carried out once. Both times, the pizza has been amazing. The pizza does take a bit longer than most other places, so if you want fast and mediocre pizza, go somewhere else. Definitely order the pan and load it with toppings. We had the pan with mushrooms, pepperoni, and black olives and it was nothing short of perfection. It is very filling though, so I'm not usually able to eat more than a piece and a half. The large for two people is way more food than you will need, but I was excited for the leftovers the next day. Oh, and the re-heated leftovers were almost as good as the pizza was the first time. Definitely try this place."
Mmmmm cheese was good... Sauce was awesome.... it smelled so good... Atmosphere was cozy ... Must try this place
"I'll admit it. I am a snooty deep dish/pan pizza gal and i love my lou malnati's but pequod's is so good! i've heard a lot about this place and decided to give it a try. I don't want to say i like it better than lou's because its so different. its light on the stomach and big on flavor. we got a small deep dish, we got two slices each and it was more than enough,the best part was that the bill ended up being 12 bucks before tip! I am definitely coming back for some more delicious deep dish!"
awesome deep dish! order it extra done so the fabulous crust tastes even better. the caesar salad just fair.
"Had the personal pan pizzas and they were excellent.  Also had the house salad with the house Italian dressing, also very good."
"One of the top 3 places for pizza in Chicago along side Lou malnati's and Armand's . They do a unique deep dish which has a Carmelites burnt cheese crust which is ahhhhhhmazing!! They also do a 5 dollar lunch special with a personal deep dish and a beer . The staff is great and very friendly, definitely a treat every time I get the chance to eat here!!"
"My mom says this is better than Lou's. She's crazy. With that said, it's still a fantastic pizza place, especially for fans of sauce and burnt cheese. The burned cheese crust is miraculous. Awesome, fresh toppings. It's just not really comfortable or a fun dining experience because its small and loud. I hope they expand. This is a ""must try"" Chicago place, though. So come. ASAP."
Great Pizza. I think i was just so glad I got a deep dish pizza that possibly my review is overinflated. But it was delicious. Cool location in a cool town.
"Pequod's is the only place I know that can actually go head-to-head with Lou Malnati's. The caramelized crust is to die for. The bruschetta and the combination platter were very good, but kinda standard. The servers and hosts are kind, but don't try to kiss your ass, which I love."
"A few months back I wanted to set up a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend, and Pequod's was AMAZINGLY HELPFUL when it came to helping me set it up and pull off the surprise.  The surprise was pulled off beautifully and was a night to remember.  Also, the service was great, the food was delicious, and all reasonably priced for the quality/quantity of food we all got.  Great for large groups!  THANK YOU Pequod's!"
"Went here mid-afternoon with a holiday hangover, where I'd spent the last week boozing & gorging with the family. They had Great Lakes Christmas Ale (IN PITCHERS!!!), and the most delightful deep dish. Perfect balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings. Crust was perfection. Oregano on the table & excellent marinara. It's a pretty large joint, but I'd probably recommend going at off peak hours (unless you don't mind waiting)."
"My nephew who is in Chicago for college told us about this restaurant. After eating here, I just could not go anywhere else for deep dish. I saw and saw others but my mouth longed and drooled for this place. Its a shame our hotel wasn't anywhere close to this place. But fortunate it was far enough otherwise I'd be a fat pig in the hospital before my trip ended. Awe man, I want some now! Why can't Cali have something like this ?!?!"
"Wish there were more sausage on the pizza, but overall good. Service is great. Make a reservation if on a weekend night. But, if you have to wait, go next door to the Drinkingbird."
Hands down best pizza in Chicago.  Lou's is great but pequods is just a bit better!  The caramelized crust can't be beat.
"This is the best pizza place in Chicago. Hands down.  Order the pan, extra sausage, a little well done...it does not get better than this. Also, order a spicy bloody mary, won't be disappointed."
Extremely well seasoned cast iron. Gooey high quality cheese fantastic sauce and stellar toppings all make for an extremely enjoyable pizza. What separates their pizza from the rest is the caramelized crown that surrounds the edge of the pizza. NOTHING compliments pizza crust like caramelized cheese!!! Must go
Holy moly these pizzas are great! We called ahead from the house to order a deep dish mushroom and spinach. We arrived and were sat in the secret upstairs dining area. The pizza came out about 15 minutes later. We ordered some onion rings in the mean time.The pizza has this burnt cheese crust thing that is super delicious. The onion rings were cut and fried just right too and served with barbecue sauce.  Next time I'm ordering anchovies!
"The BEST pizza I have ever consumed!  Be warned...  Get less than you think.  A personal deep dish will serve two.  A small will feed three.  A medium will feed five.  Get it?  But besides getting totally full, this place was amazing.  On a tip, we enjoyed a giardiniera, garlic, basil, and sliced sausage pizza and I can't explain the enjoyment it created!  The ambiance was ""local"" and relaxed.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Also, if you go there on Friday or Saturday, be early or be ready to wait about 2 hours.  Locals kill this place on the weekends.  Enjoy!"
"This is my favorite deep dish pizza in the city. Luckily I live close enough to get delivery, because the wait can be really long to dine in. Call ahead or go at off peak dinning hours- the pizza is definitely worth it."
"At my job I deal with a lot of people who are new to Chicago. Often, we talk about the things that make this city an awesome place to live...and of course, food is right up there at the top of my list. This place is just the best, and I always go out of my way to recommend it to recent Chicago transplants. Maybe not the textbook ""Chicago-style"" pizza (for that how could you not recommend Lou Malnati's?), but from the large chunks of sausage to the carmelized crust, I've never had a Pequod's pizza that was less than delicious. I've eaten at Pequod's for years & years-first up in Morton Grove, and now in Lincoln Park-and never get tired of it. Can't go too long without getting my Pequod's fix. Yum!"
"Often noted as the best deep dish in Chicago - Pequod's is very good, but not quite sure it tops Lou's.  The crust is thinner which I actually like and they use less chunky tomato sauce, but the dough itself doesn't quite match the Lou's flavor.  One major downside is their delivery takes forever.  If you order around lunch plan at least 1.5 hours - the perfect amount of time to go to the gym, take a shower, and then ruin all the calories you just burned off."
Really good pizza.Every member of the staff that I saw was a cute girl.What more do you want?
"I rarely eat deep dish, but had a friend in town who wanted to try it and took him here based on the good reviews.The pizza definitely lived up to the reputation....very well executed and tasty.  Generous amounts of pepperoni and other toppings and a perfectly baked crust.  Definitely a thumbs up for deep dish!  I don't eat deep dish enough to compare it to the other big players in deep dish, but I certainly enjoyed it."
"Pequods is hands down my favorite pizza in Chicago. This isn't to say it's my favorite Chicago stlye pizza, however. To be fair Pequods, as advertised, is pan pizza at its finest. It's not the stuffed or deep dish variety that other Chicago joints serve up and I like it that way. Burnt, camalized edges and crispy pepperoni with just enough cheese to hold up to the delicious crust underneath.The atmosphere is inviting with exposed brick walls and a dimly-lit bar room setting. There are booths for two and those that offer more seating as well as tables and stools around the bar. The staff is very friendly and seem to enjoy working together which is nice, as most places I venture into...it seems service is lacking.The waitress I had around lunch hour greeted me quickly and took my order... had my beverage out just as fast and asked how I was doing. The manager on duty also came by to ensure all was OK.They offer a great lunch special. A personal pan pizza and cola or Miller Light pint for $4.95. This is unbeatable. Expect to wait about 20 minutes for your pie to cook. It'sworth it even if you are sitting alone guzzling a pint of Miller Light in the middle of the afternoon.The overall experience here is enjoyable. I'll be back, as I always am and I'll continue to refer friends to this place for a great slice of pan pizza.Great atmosphere, great service, all around great neighborhood pizza stop!"
"-Cheesy garlic bread is the bomb. Best cheese ever.-Fries doesn't look great, but they were perfectly salted.-Thin crust pizza was okay. I probably wouldn't get it again.-Pan pizza with the caramelized crust was pretty awesome. Get the sausage but stay away from the fresh basil because they don't give much of it.Great service and the pizza comes out pretty quick (when we went, at least). Thumbs up for value."
"Delicious deep-dish! So much better than Lou Malnattis! This pizza is so good. Went with a friend and we shared a small deep-dish, which was the perfect amount for 2 people. Scoped out other tables and it seems that the medium was good for parties of 3-4, with a large (plus appetizers) being ideal for a party of 5.The sauce is delicious and the crust is a great consistency (and doesn't taste like it was just de-thawed like the crust from Lou Malnattis).Will definitely come back!"
"My first deep dish pizza. My hubbie and I ordered a large pizza with sausages, mushrooms and pepperoncini. He loved it, but after trying it I prefer a thin crust pizza. First of all, it's a really big pizza. It was enough to eat as dinner and the next day as lunch for the two of us. Second, it tasted really good. Overall we would def order here again."
Loved the pizza sauce here. I ordered sausage pizza and the wait was insane but I pre-ordered before so my wait was 15-20min.
"After reading a TON of deep-dish pizza reviews, we decided on Pequod's because it was slightly out of the way and seemed to be one of the least likely spots to be invaded by crowds of tourists with Navy Pier bags.And GODDAMN!  So incredibly tasty.  You might argue that it's ""pan pizza,"" not actually ""deep dish,"" but to be completely honest, I don't really care.  The sausage was out of this world (big chunks, very flavorful, hints of fennel), and we loved the caramelized cheese around the edge.  Plus, a pretty nice beer selection.  The place was half empty on the Tuesday night that we were there (8-9ish), which was also awesome."
"This is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. I love the way the crust on the edges is burnt and crispy. The crust really is great. The ingredients are put on in hearty portions, and the sausage is awesome. It also has a really great environment, with hockey games on all the time. They also have a good beer selection, a key ingredient of a solid deep dish pizza place. Do check it out!"
"Stopped in here the other night to try it for the first time. We ordered a deep dish sausage and pepperoni. I had a group of 4 and we are some pizza veterans so we are hard to please and all have different tastes. Plus, we have tried all the north and south side pizza joints and downtown too. Pequods was hands down the greatest pizza I have ever had. The dough was perfect, sauce was perfect, the carmalized cheese edges were great. It was really the best. A z-large fed 4 people perfectly and we grabbed two orders of fries for a side dish. The price for that was great. The only down side was the beer prices. There are absolutely no drink specials all week long and a pitcher cost us around $18. Kind of expensive for a neighborhood place but it's ok. If i go again, I'll skip the beer and hit a bar afterwards. Like I said everything else was perfect. The atmosphere is fun and the customer service is great too."
"I can't believe I have yet to write a review on my favorite pizza spot! Best pan pizza, best sausage,  excellent service, timely food delivery and over all great spot! The manager is ALWAYS running around helping people out, acting as the hostess etc. incredibly establishment and I love that the owners daughter has a strong presence there. They created a foundation in her name and it moves me every time I visit. Just go once to try it...I promise you will be back."
Not sure how I haven't written a review since I go to Pequod's pretty much any chance I can get. Their lunch special during the week is a ridiculous bargain. Great place to take out-of-town guests that is real Chicago and not a tourist trap. The carmelized crust on the pizza is so good. I can't get enough.
"Pequod's is our favorite local deep dish pizza, no doubt.  Their crust is amazing as they somehow incorporate crispy onions into it.  We also love the Pequod's salad.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I take all of my visitors to Pequods as opposed to the more touristy Gino's or Giordano's."
"I will remain forever loyal to my NY pizza but GOOD LORD is Pequod's tasty!To me, pizza is synonymous with the perfect balance of cheese, sauce, & bread of a large floppy slice from my favorite pizzeria in NJ, but I'm starting to cross over to the dark side.The best part of Pequod's pan pizza is by far the crust.  Caramelized and crunchy yet chewy and not crumbly like other deep dish pizza places.  I've only gotten delivery and so I can't comment on the restaurant experience, but as an East Coaster who has been ridiculously stubborn about her pizza preferences for the past 8 years, I will say...I'm in love, Pequod's.  Thank you."
"Lou Malnati's will probably always be my #1, but this place got me thinking twice!  Pequod's looks small on the outside, but we were seated upstairs and there was sooo much room! Who knew?We ordered a SMALL deep dish with mushroom and sausage for 2 people and we still had a slice left over!  The pizza is very filling.I love the crispy crust and the sausage topping was really tasty. Will be back soon."
"My husband wanted to try some real deep dish while we were in Chicago, so my friend brought us here.  Great service, cute area, and gooey slices.  We ordered at 14"" for 3 people and it was too much since the slices were so thick!  next time I'd go with a 10""."
"BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! Before you read this, please note I am an east coast girl and used to NY style pizza. I was stranded in Chicago due to a canceled flight and looked up Chicago pizza, and Pequod's was number one on Yelp, so I decided to go. This was my first taste of Chicago style pizza and I believe it has ruined me; it was absolutely amazing!!! The next day I went to Giordano's for lunch and it was good, but left my craving Pequod's so I returned that night. I AM OFFICIALLY CONVERTED TO CHICAGO OVER NY!"
"Rumor has it that Pequod himself/herself/itself placed a large deep dish with pepperonis in front of a pre-hibernation Grizzly.  The Grizzly ate three slices, stared at the rest for 10 minutes, then slunk away in shame and died of carbohydrate poisoning.The rumor is true, for what Pequod's offers is an unparalleled deep dish gut bomb of death experience.  The motto here: One slice is a meal, two a mistake, three a nightmare.And while the pizza is good enough to rocket Pequod himself/herself/itself to Chicago pizza infamy, the restaurant has chosen to forgo commercialized tackiness in favor of the modest and timeless feel of a 1980s family restaurant.  The kind of place where you'd eat a nice pie before losing your virginity in high school or watching Ronald Reagan get shot or whatever they did."
"cmon. youre kidding yourself if you think this is not the best deep dish in chicago. great atmosphere, great sports bar. great place to watch the blackhawks. friendly service"
"My favorite deep dish in the city that started it all. It's that good, go try it. Now!"
This pizza is so damn good that when I'm eating it I cry tears of joy while cumming in my pants.  Enough said.
You can read everyone else's review for details. The pizza is great. End of story.
"Visiting Chi town from LA of course I  needed to try what they are known for so I Ordered a small deep dish with Sausage, mushrooms, and green peppers. The best part of the pizza is the crust...yummy ""caramelized"" crust...as referred in another review. I love thebig pieces of sausage. One slice was more than enough!!"
"Not to disparage any of the usual suspects, but this is the best pizza in Chicago. Have been addicted for over 20 years.  One of things we miss most about our hometown, and make multiple visits every return trip.  If you're anywhere near it's well worth the effort to get here (and any wait once you are).  Enjoy."
This is the best pizza I have had to date. The crust is amazing. I also really like the lunch special. Your not gonna find better food for 4.95$. I would and do recommend this to anyone.
"Having tried over a dozen chicago titans of deep dish, including Lou malnatis, pizzeria uno, Giardino etc.this is where the search for the best chicago deep dish ends. I had almost decided that deep dish wasnt for me till i tried this place. Absolutely love the charred crust. The lines out the door and the wait for the pizza is the only thing which sucks but aw well guess they r famous for a reason!"
"This was one of my favorite pizza places to eat at while living in Chicago. After I went for the first time, I took a couple of friends and family members here because the pizza is delicious! I'd suggest doing a call ahead seating, because everytime I go there, its always busy or gets busy as we are waiting for our food. The prices are reasonable and the food is good so I have no complaints. We accidenatly ordered the thing crust pizza and it was not as good as the deep dish pizza. The deep dish is by far better than the thin crust."
"One of the BEST pizzas I've EVER had!  The carmelized thick, deep dish crust with all of the toppings I got- jalapenos, fresh garlic, onions, and beef meatballs, made my taste buds think they were in HEAVEN! Service was great too, especially for being so busy on a Saturday night.  I recommend this place to everyone!  You will DEFINITELY not be disappointed."
"In Chicago there is no shortage of pizza places....albeit, many of them very good. Everybody knows about the staples Lou Malnatis and such but honestly Pequods is hands down the best Chicago style pizza in town. Their sauce is incredible, the crust is perfect and the Carmelized cheese on the crust may be the perfect bite of pizza. Do yourself a favor and try Pequods if you have not already. There is a good chance that you will not want pizza from any other restaurant in town!!!"
"We recently moved to Chicago and this was the first place we decided to try deep dish pizza. We ordered a tossed house salad and a medium 12"" pan pizza with extra cheese, onion, sausage and pepperoni. This pizza was absolutely delicious. I had my doubts about deep dish pizza opting for thin crusted NY style slices but I now am on the fence. I definitely want to return to try a few different toppings but overall we had a great experience here. My soda was constantly full along with our waters and the salad was refreshing, topped with carrots, black olives and tomatoes. We only finished 1/2 the pizza and brought home the other half to have for leftovers!"
"My friends living in Chicago all recommended Pequod's as the best chicago deep dish out there and when I tried it, I ended up ordering 2 more pie's for my drive back to St. Louis so that I could eat it back there. And I've got to say, after heating it back up and eating it in St. Louis, it is still really good. Not as good as when it's fresh but still very good. I got the pepperoni deep dish pizza which with the combination of the cheese is terrific.One of my coworkers was going to visit Chicago from St. Louis and was driving up with his family and wanted to know some good places to see and restaurants to eat at there. I told him a bunch of good places but he cut me off and wanted to know a good deep dish pizza place first. So I told him Pequod's and then gave him my list of other good restaurants. Well. He got there on Friday night with his family and went straight to Pequod's for dinner. They absolutely loved the deep dish pizza and every single one of their meals after, they ate at Pequod's. They completely ignored my other restaurant lists and just went to Pequod's. On Sunday, they ate there at lunch and ordered 4 more deep dishes to go to bring back to St. Louis. One for me for telling them about this place and 3 more for food for the rest of the week."
By far the BEST in town! This is NOT only the ONLY good Chicago Style Pizza in we had while in Chicago it was sooooooo good we went back again before leaving town.Never have been a deep styled pizza lover and BOY do I LOVE ME SOME PIZZA!Went to Pequod's on the recommendation of a friend who used to live there and I must say he was right! We sampled as all of the USUAL PEOPLE DO both the UNO & LOU whomever he is chain and they didn't even come close.This place made a believer in deep dish out of me!SERVICE was great and a bit of a wait but well worth it!
"I went with a group of acquaintances from my 1 session pottery class that I purchased from Groupon, to eat dinner here.  One of them was lactose intolerant, we had to wait in the restaurant after eating, because we all rode in one car and the lactose intolerant person was in there for an additional 45 minutes.  I subtracted a star because of that and the car ride was awkward and moist."
"I'm so glad my coworker recommened this place.  It's the best pan pizza i've ever tasted.  It's absolutely delicious.  The crust is exactly the way I like it,  cheesy, crispy and buttery.  I ordered the 10"" pepperoni pan pizza and only ate two pieces.  I didn't want to stop eating but they were filling.  I wish it was a little bigger.  I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch and all the tables and bar were full.  I can only imagine what it's like weekend nights. Forget Giordano's and Lou Malnattis, Pequod's is my new favorite (pan) pizza spot.  I can't wait to go back."
"I dig it. I was a little reticent to eat here, as I am not a fan of Chicago-style pizza. Add in the sports/frat element and I was sure I was gonna hate it.Nope.The pizza is really, pretty d@mn good. Pardoned from the Palette Bistro Fiasco™, I was, once again, allowed to pick toppings for the pizza. One stuffed with sausage, peppers and basil and one thin with pepperoni, peppers and garlic and we were in business. The stuffed (or is it deep dish; 6+ years and I still don't know) was very enjoyable. The crust was crispy and caramelized (THE deciding factor) and made every bite a race to get to the end. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was just the consistency I like. Usually, I am all about the thin crust. Here, I would (and did) eat both. Add in a Chimay and the first game of the Stanley Cup finals and you have one surprisingly enjoyable experience. I am rarely in this part of town and after my trip here, I wondered why that is. There are many shops on this stretch of Clyborn and Pequod's is a Chicago institution that deserves my respect. After eating here, it's earned my patronage."
"12 years. That's how long its been since I was last here. And though it's not 1999 and tons has changed, pequod's is exactly how I remember it. God bless that.I had a hankering for some deep dish so I got my order for takeout. The pizza was great and really tasty. The pepperoni and sausage were piled on while as well. I almost had a flashback after eating a slice. Though hallucinogenic experiences didn't happen, joy was had by me. It was hard not to really dig into this, but it had to be savored as well. 12 years is a good chunk of time and it certainly won't be that long until the next time"
WOW! Deep dish goodness.
I've tried a few of the popular deep dish places in Chicago and this is probably my favorite one. My boyfriend and I tried it out for the first time last month and were both very impressed. Even the house salad was delish! Great service. Really liked the sauce and the cheese. Must try!
"D-d-d-damn, son!  This pizza was incredible.  Layers of delicious cheese, a tasty sauce that beats out most of the competition and the crust.  Oh my god, the crust.  Caramelized cheese on the crust was the most brilliant thing about Pequod's.  Last night I ate like a fat kid going out of style and already I'm looking forward to lunch today.Moral of the story: stop reading reviews and go get some.  You won't be sorry."
"Awesome thick crust pizza, my new found Chicago favorite. Love how they caramelize the cheese on the edges, delicious!Tried the thin crust yesterday and was a little disappointed. $30 for a 16' inch 3 topping average thin crust pizza is a bit much.Go with the thick crust!!"
"Yay I finally had your deep dish.I cannot remember the last time I dined at Pequod, it's been forever.Ordered delivery of a LG sausage and garlic deep dish pizza.  It was great.  The cooked cheese crust on the sides tasted like Saganaki, had a wonderful burned/cook cheese taste.Your sausage had great flavor.  I usually hate pizza sausage as my wife usually likes it and I don't like the sausage that is typically used.  Your's tasted savory all by itself.  It was also well cooked.  Little bits of garlic goodness all over the pizza, you did it perfectly.  Enough garlic to flavor the pizza, but not enough to scare the UPS guy and kill my small children.You've now made my pizza takeout shortlist, which includes Cafe Luigi and Piece.We also ordered a thin crust for my boys, I didn't have any but they tore into it like Andy Dick into a bottle of Wolfschmidt Vodka."
"Since moving to Chicago, I've been kind of a pizza slut.  I've hooked up with Giordano, Gino, Lou Malnati, Eduardo, Pizano, Sarpino, and  regrettably Papa John. I wanted it all kinds of ways - deep dish, thin crust, it didn't matter. But then I met Pequod's. The kind of pizza place that makes an honest woman out of you. The love affair began with caramelized cheese crust and the passion is kept alive by, well, caramelized cheese crust. Because of the bond I feel with Pequod's, I felt confident enough that the pizza would wow my out of town friends and give my Chicago-based friends an alternative to deep dish. Pequod's did not disappoint. I was able to make a reservation for 15 people on a Saturday night 4 days prior to the date (just an FYI, they will charge your credit card $25 if you don't show up for your reservation), which impressed and relieved me. It was extremely hot in the restaurant - I'm guessing that 90 degree temps outside and constantly running pizza ovens aren't helping the case, but I would've appreciated a little extra AC so my white shorts didn't become translucent with sweat. Would I let a little perspiration taint this review? Not hardly. Thankfully our waitress kept the pitchers of beer coming and saved us all from dehydration. The pizza was delicious, as I knew that it would be. Everyone at our table earned clean plate awards, even if some (myself included) needed some extra prodding to eat another piece. I enjoy the fact that the pizza isn't as heavy and cheesy as other deep dishes tend to be. That doesn't mean that we didn't need to be rolled out of there, because we did, it just means that I didn't have a cement brick of cheese in my stomach post-meal. In addition to being tasty, Pequod's is cheap! Relatively speaking anyway. If you're not drooling after reading all of the Yelp reviews about the deliciousness, then maybe pizza just doesn't do it for you. And if that's the case, then I feel sorry for you because you're truly missing out."
"This was recommended by a restaurant owner I met in Cozumel, MX. He has tried to duplicate this pizza, but had not yet mastered the carmelized crust. I have always been a Lou's fan, but this rocked!!"
"So I had Lou Malnati's as well as Giordano's before trying Pequod's... and I think the others are better. The caramelized crust is something great (you can see Little Caesar's try to copy them with the new crappy deep dish they're putting out). However, the appetizers I had were just not that good. My mozzarella sticks were underfried, and the Jalepeño Poppers did not taste very fresh (probably frozen!).The place was packed, it is very cozy, but I had a great seat on the top floor near a window where I could see out to street. Great atmosphere!"
"I have to tell you guys, pequod's has one of the best lunch deals around. $5 for a personal pizza and a fountain soda (or bud lite)? Pretty freaking great. Call ahead to have your pizza-eating perfectly timed and a table waiting. And it's a pretty hefty pizza, totally enough for lunch. Mmmmmm."
"Mmmm, Pequod's. Probably my third favorite Chicago pizza, behind Due's and Malnati's (back off you Giordano's weirdos!). I think I actually like the location in Morton Grove better, for the divey ambiance, but the pizza is killer at either location.As many, many others have said, the crust is amazingly caramelized and crispy. They don't dump a ton of cheese on the pizza, so you can actually taste the sauce and crust. A must try!"
"Damn good deep dish pizza.Got a sausage pizza and it was delicious. Caramelized crust added another level of flavor. Crusty was nice and buttery and crisp too.Also got wings which were great. I ate all of them so I was full before eating the pizza. I don't eat that much deep dish because I love thing crust so much, but I think I could fit Pequods into my weekly eating schedule."
Arguably the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Love the burnt edges on the crust!
"pequod's,you are the definition of pizza heaven.if you are looking for a great lunch special and fun atmosphere this is definitely the place to be.4.95 for pizza and beer!? who can beat that?! plus super friendly service and delicious cocktails.don't let the outside fool ya! next time i'm buying myself a tshirt. :)"
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago - or anywhere for that matter.  Period.
"In a city filled with and known for amazing deep dish pizza, it can be difficult to stick out. You've got your Uno's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's Gino's East, etc. How's a (relatively) small pizza chain with a questionably pronounceable name supposed to stand out? Lou's has their delicious toppings, Giordano's has cheese portions that cause the Food Pyramid to crumble, Gino's has their sauce and what does Pequod's have? Their crust. Their delicious, caramelized crust with seasoning soaked right into the pans they emerge from, akin to a fine whiskey absorbing the flavors and aromas in its cask. Rounding out the pies are fresh toppings, just enough cheese to drape the sides of your slice and sauce with the slightest hint of sweetness.If one were to nitpick (not me, just... one), the top floor can get relatively loud when the place gets packed, simply due to the narrow areas near the back reflecting the charming sound of people yelling at televisions. But then again you're not here for the atmosphere. You're here to get your pizza on.Oh yeah, they have a fantastic lunch special of a personal pizza and drink for under five bucks. You'd spend more grabbing lunch at potbelly's."
"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but damn. Pequods is the best deep dish pizza place in Chicago. I say this with overt confidence. The neighborhood feel of the restaurant creates an amazing, authentic Chicago experience. Extra cheese, giardiniera, and sausage. You won't be sorry. Pequods is a must for Chicago deep dish, come here once you get past all the touristy deep dish joints."
"Shortest review ever:  Hands-Down Best Deep Dish in the World (if you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe Anthony Bourdain who said that Burt's Place, he's the founder of Pequod's, is the best pizza, period).Service-Not good, but it's 100% worth dealing with the service."
Amazing deep-dish pie and definitely worth the trip out from downtown.
"Let the tourists go get the generic, mostly-crust, flavorless stuff on Mich Ave. Head the Pequod's if you want the wait to be worth it.Every time someone came to Chicago, we took them here and they loved it.Great carmelized crust. Great toppings (but don't get more than 2 or 3, trust me). Great atmosphere - more like a sports bar than the faux Italian you'll get from Gino's, etc.The service is quick. Quality Chicago brews on tap.Expensive, and most likely you'll have to wait. But it is completely worth both."
"How can you tell you're truly a Chicagoan after moving from another city?  The though of Chicago Stuffed Dish pizza makes your stomach turn a knot at its mere sight.  We've all been there.  We transplant from some Big10/Midwest school, move into our Lincoln Park/Wrigleyville dive spot and order Giordano's constantly for the next 3 months because we LOVE chi deep dish pizza.  Twelve months later, your frat brother from Columbus comes to visit and insists on ordering Chi's most famous pizza and you are absolutely revolted at the thought of consuming any more. That's where Pequods comes in to save the day (sorry for the long intro).  Best Pizza In The City....I know bold statement.  The deep dish is unlike anything I've ever had.  In what had to be the byproduct of a deal with the devil, the crust is the best part of the pizza.  The ring of cheese they put around the crust that caramelizes to perfection makes the pizza.  I wish they would make breadsticks like this, but it wouldn't be the same.  The pizza itself is very good, tons of ingredients, but its very heavy.  One slice will fill you up, two will knock you out, three....well....."
The pizza is really good here. Was really impressed by that they deliver to Presedential towers. Only took them an hour and it was still hot.
"I'd heard such great things about this place so the anticipation was high.  It was probably a bad choice going on a Friday night around 6PM because  it was SO crowded! I mean people bumping into our table crowded and children everywhere... aside from that the service was fast and the pizza was yummy.  I prefer thin crust to thick/pan style, and they had both to choose from.  The thin crust was a little more thick than I typically enjoy but the sauce and toppings made up for it. Definitely worth a try!"
Caramelized cheese looks so nasty but tastes so amazingly delicious!  That is all.
Very good deep dish. This is the only pizza place i went to in Chicago so I can't really compare to the other places. Do yourself a favor and order according to 1 slice per person.
Im from the west coast just went in there to night to geta  real chicago deep dish pep and sausage with some hef and jack adams. Chey our server and everybody else was awesome. great service. even wrapped up our pizza after we were done. so awesome.
I love this place!Little neighborhood Pizza joint with a great vibe and amazing deep dish pizza - will be back!
Their pizza is pretty awesome. I love their crust the most. I am a big fan of fried zucchini aswell and their portions for ordering Fried Zucchini was incredibly minimal but they're food all in all is pretty stellar. Excellent pizza!
"We enjoyed this pizza place during our boys trip to Chicago last week.  Great Neighborhood, atmosphere in the restaurant and bar was cool.  Good Pizza, Salad, Beers and cool wait staff.  Seems like a legit Chicago Institution."
Oh hai Pequods!What's that? You deliver to West Loop?There's your 5th star!
I had my first Chicago-style deep dish pizza here while visiting. It was fantastic. I will be visiting here every time I visit Chicago.
"We came here before a movie last Friday and got in just before the big rush (6 PM). We had the thin crust with pepperoni, jalapenos and mushrooms and devoured all but 2 slices! This place gets packed so the earlier you get there the better. This was my first time dining in the restaurant, and I loved it. It has that small, family style, pizza joint restaurant feel with really great pizza!!"
"I'm a fanatical fan of Chicago deep dish now. Sauce was great, toppings were great, nicely blackened crust, great stuff!"
"Seriously good pizza!! Pan is the best! Go with different ingredients!! Place is busy on weekends, take out of towners. So good!! Giving a 4 cause it is debatable which is the best!"
"This pizza is all about the caramelized crust. A delicious take on deep dish. A fun dining atmosphere, however, last time when I came with a group our waitress was a bit rude and slow with the service. Four stars still for the pizza itself. Best deep dish in Chicago that I've had so far."
"I will briefly remark on the Pizza as that is the only thing (and Beer) I consume at this place.Great deep-dish...if you order it with meat it is fantastic, the cheese is good too. no complaints. We have tried the other local places and we are in a committed relationship here!"
"Best Pan pizza in chicago!I love this place their pizza is just amazing!I love the sauce, the crust, and the caramelized cheese."
"I like their pizza.  I can vouch for their italian beef & giardiniera pizza.They have to give credit to Burt's in Morton Grove/Skokie (original), but otherwise, this place is great!"
"I had friends in town for the weekend, and of course they requested deep dish pizza on their visit.  I'd never been to Pequod's, but I'd heard great things and decided to give it a shot.  I'm so glad we did!  We reserved a table on their website ahead of time, so we walked right in.  The hostess seemed like she'd rather be doing just about anything else, but our waitress was super nice and friendly.  Onto the pizza itself: I know there's a lot of personal preference here, but I loved it.  The other deep dish places I've been to have way too much cheese on their pies for my taste.  Pequod's is heavy on the bread and sauce, which I love.  We also got the Pequod's salad to share, which was good (especially with the homemade dressings).  Deep dish is more of an occasional treat than an all the time thing for me, but the next time I have it, I'll be coming back to Pequod's."
"Best find ever. The deep dish was amazing. The bread was delish, the sauce not overly sweet but obviously good tomato base. Service was outstanding. Our drinks never got below half full. Only reason this isn't five stars is that I personally prefer a tad more cheese. I highly recommend eating here. Also- kid friendly!"
"This is my favorite spot for Chicago style pizza.It is right by the Webster Place movie theater, so it is a perfect place to eat before or after a movie.I love the pizza because it has a delicious crispy crust, and they use plenty of cheese.They are open late!"
"Great pizza place near the movie theater on Webster. Downstairs has a sports bar feel and upstairs is more of a family restaurant. Pizza is great, has a burned cheese ring around the edge of the crust. Not much else worth ordering on the menu, though some of the fried appetizers are pretty good. Good place for a group, as everyone will probably order pizza and you can get pitchers of beer. This is my bf's favorite Chicago pizza, and it's definitely in my top 5 (my favorite is Pizano's)."
"Pizza is amazing. Staff is friendly, always seen on the verge of being ""too busy"" because it is always crowded when I go. Even early afternoon. However, the pizza makes up for it. I like the upstairs and the vibe of the place but I have also done take out. They will half-bake pizzas for you to take home. That was perfect for bringing it to a family function an hour away."
"Excellent pan pizza. Can't say ive ever had better... yet. Best sausage on a pizza and absolutely the best crust carmelized with cheese.  Poor parking situation but worth dealing with it. Can barely eat more than two slices, very filling. I always ask for extra cheese regardles of the other ingredients."
"This place was the third stop on our Chicago Pizza Tour.  We had a deep dish pizza with sausage, and it was really good.  I didn't think the sausage was as tasty as the sausage at Pizano's... Also, I wasn't a fan of all the sauce slathered on the top of the pizza.  I'm not a huge sauce fan, and for me, less=better.  But everything else, the crust, the cheese, etc. was yummy."
"To bite into a Pequod's pizza crust is to contemplate that if Heaven were to have a taste would this be it. Hands down best pizza, deep dish or otherwise, I've ever had."
"So for my 4th trip to Pequod's I owed it to them to give this place its long over due piece of my writing action and Yelp this wonderful pizza joint.On Saturday before my fellow Wisconsinite (yes it's really a word) friend was due to depart to la France, we decided to treat her belly to the most delightful pan-style pizza that Chicago has to offer.I swear if I worked here, I'd gain 50 pounds in a month and have more dimples on my butt than an orange has on its peel.  Pequod's always delivers!  Pizza arrives thick, with perfectly browned cheese-crusted edges, perfectly melted cheese, and a flavor that leaves one believing they'd be willing to eat an entire Pequod's pizza alone.  Even I, who doesn't normally eat pizza, can't ever resist.  I just wish I had my own cutting utensil so I didn't have to accept the generous pre-determined size slices.Let's just all hope I don't have to go looking for a day job anytime soon."
"Top 3 pizza in Chicago - Love the deep dish!  My only complaint is the restaurant is jammed packed and it's tough to move and get around the restaurant.   We called ahead and put our name on the list for a table of 4 and only had to wait maybe 15 minutes before we were sat on a busy Friday night.  However, when we were sat, we were put at a small table when there was a larger booth open.  A party of 2 was then sat at the larger booth.Good service, great food, two good HD TVs showing the Bulls game!!!"
"I've been going here my whole life. Best deep dish there is. If you're in Chicago, go here... often."
Love the deep dish - Pequod's is the only pie of that version I actually crave.  It's not too expensive considering its top quality.  I like going mid-day because no one is there and they have pizza and drink deals. Great now I want Pequod's - phew it's still open!
"I think about Pequod's pan pizza and carmelized crust more often than I'd like to admit.   The fact that leggings are in style means that I eat it much more often than I should.Pequod's, you are the epitome of a love-hate relationship.   I love you.  Hate what you do to my belly.    Really though, I love you."
The deep dish pizza really is Amazing! Everything I had expected it to be. The crust is so delicious!
"as i've stated in other pizza reviews, we still haven't found a place that makes it as delicious as we do in our own home, and this place was no exception, but i still think it was delicious! the rumors are true, though, very crowded, so make a reservation or plan to wait for a bit.it's a cool atmosphere, very laid back and boozey. guessing that has to do with the proximity to the college campus. regardless, the wings and the pizza were tasty (we did not get deep dish, though i've heard that's a real claim to fame for them), and this is definitely a great place to come for a laidback place to watch the HAWKS!"
"Note that I gave this place 5 stars, a rare- very rare occasion for me. Keep in mind that those 5 stars are strictly rating the pizza and the pizza alone. This review is a one time only deal and here's why. If you go into the place to eat (which I'm NOT recommending) sit wherever you can squeeze in, don't ask a lot of questions, keep your head down and don't make a lot of eye contact. The ambiance and staff are a suck fest. There I said it. But the pizza is sooo good!The deep dish is out of this world. Talk about an indulgence. The dough is not just dough it's like buttery, crispy, yet slightly chewy dough heaven. The sauce, garlicky, basily, ripe tomato and perfectly seasoned amazing. Toppings and cheese all pile on nicely, all together it's like magic in your mouth. Then you get to the crust. Which has caramelized cheese baked on it. O.M.G.- I mean it, that's the first thing you'll say after you've bitten into what might be your own personal island of pizza paradise!!If you're in their delivery area, lucky you. Otherwise take it to go. It'll be the most expensive (not like a $100 bucks or anything, but a loaded medium deep dish is like $35 dollars, wtf?), but the most tasty deep dish you will ever have, I promise."
Everytime I come to Chicago i have to eat Pequods. This is great deep dish pizza. Maybe im lucky cuz i never had to wait for a table. I usually get the sausage and onion pie. Only 2 slices and im full as hell. Pequods how i wish you would come open up in California.
"We called in advance to make sure that we could get a seat and went ahead and put our order in. This place is the perfect place to take a family, to watch the game, or to just hang out with friends and enjoy some GREAT deep dish pizza. I was thoroughly impressed. The crust is crisp not gooey. It's just overall awesome."
"This place makes a fantastic deep dish pizza, and a solid beer selection for a pizza place.  Recommended."
"While lots of my peeps come to this hotspot for deep dish, I actually crave the thin crust pizza. (Sorry! Lou M's has my heart forever  for deep dish). Pequod's  thin crust isn't actually NY style thin crust - it's a medium thickness between NY style and deepdish and they pack in the toppings beneath gooey cheese set on a comforting crispy  warm carmelized crust. It's a crust you actually want to eat, not leave on your plate! No recommendations on toppings - just pile on whatever you like! I've had pineapple/ham, sausage/mushroom, spinach/mushroom, i mean it doesn't MATTER what you put on your pizza here! it's just AWESOME!Thank goodness they expanded this place to 2 floors! The wait was getting unbearable. This past time I sat upstairs - great sports bar setting!  Go for the craft brews!"
Despite the busted AC downstairs my Food Boner during eat time was flush.
"Pequods has officially done the impossible. I have finally met a pan pizza worth raving about!Before my ex took me here two years ago (whomp whomp), I was loathe to let a piece of pan cross my lips. I mean what was the point? It wasn't thin, foldy and greasy and it sure as shit wasn't stuffed!!! (Still my absolute fave.) My mentality was save myself the calories and walk down the street to Art of Pizza. But much like Sarah Palin, Pequods is a game-changer. Maybe its the sauce, maybe its the memories or maybe its the carmelized cheese burnt right into the deliciously buttery crust (impossible to leave it on the plate).Pequods is good for take-out, delivery, a Hawks game or the non-cinematic half of a dinner-movie combo (the Webster theater is right across the street.) Can't promise you'll have better luck romantically than I did, but the pan is more than worth the shot :)"
"I'm not sure what has taken me so long to write a review on Pequod's. It is by far the best pizza in Chicago! They bake their pizza in a cast iron pan which gives the pan pizza this unique delicious caramelized crust....amazing! It may be my choice for a last meal :). They also have this great lunch special ($4.95 for a personal 1 topping pizza and beer/soda. If you live in Chicago and have not been, you are missing out!"
"Sports bar pizzeria1. Sad to read about the owner's daughter passing away from cancer. She looked like a lovely young woman. I'm humbled by how they took such a tragedy and turned it into a positive by creating a scholarship fund in her name. If the place was crap, I'd still support it just by this utilitarian virtue. 2. FoodBruchetta- pretty pricey. My friends from NYC apparently loved it. I thought it was too salty and the basil was wilted. But in their weekend here we went to Pequod's *twice* and they got the bruchetta each time. PizzaI don't dig chicago style deep dish, especially the dough-cheese-soggy dough-sauce technique. Thank god pequod's doesn't do this, they do thick dough, *scant* cheese (I had a plain cheese and was struggling to find any cheese), and copious sauce. That caramelized crust is ridiculously good and their trademark. And it is simply the *thickest* dough base I've ever come across, it's almost too thick dare I say. In the end, I'm still used to the non-Chicago, dough-sauce-cheese style. I wonder if I can get my next pan pizza like that. I'll be bringing my parents here when they come visit."
One of the best deep dish pizza's I've ever had. I'm more of a thin crust guy myself but when in chi town I suggest this place. The caramelized cheese is what separates this spot from the others. I actually thought it tasted better left over!
My favorite Chicago deep dish pizza. Love  how they make the caramelized crust and the sauce is perfect. Great atmosphere although it gets loud at times.
"Chicago = deep dish, so on a recent trip, I had to get some. Origianlly I was leaning toward Lou Malnati's but on recommendation of others here, I came here instead. And it was... very, very good. Was it better than Lou Malnati's or any of the other famous spots in the city? It's hard for me to say. I thoroughly enjoyed the pie we got, which was exactly what I was expecting. It's not something I would eat every day or week, but for a one-time thing, it was great. It just wasn't transcendent. I don't know, maybe I'm grading too hard. There's literally nothing to complain about. But I just feel like maybe I could have gotten the same pie elsewhere. Am I wrong??? I'm happy to be convinced otherwise."
"Yum!Went on a Monday night, it was bustling but not crowded.  I definitely recommend heading upstairs and getting a big comfy booth.  The upstairs was much quieter - there were still games on TV, but I think the TVs were muted.  They didn't mind at all that my group sat and talked for quite awhile.Pizza came out very quick and was delicious.  Good variety of drinks available and the prices are great for the quantity and quality of food.  Prices for fried sides looked a little high but that was probably for the best as it encouraged me to skip the sides and save room for yummy pizza :)"
the BEST deep dish za in chicago. always my go to for no chain restaurant pizza.
"I'm not crazy about deep dish pizza, but this changed my mind, as the flavor and texture was very strong. I don't really have much to add other than that, but I will say that, as someone who microwaves his leftover pizza, this stuff does not microwave well at all. Guess the microwave is a friend of, I dunno, medium-crust pizza? At Pequod's, it's either deep or thin, and I think neither one really takes to reheating that well.My first visit, actually, resulted in me going to the Thai restaurant next door as I didn't want to wait forever by myself on a Friday night (and you know, I doubt they wanted me to either... I learned my lesson after Food 4 Go). I went to the Thai joint next door which was a mistake (three stars, huh Yelp? I don't think so). Reviews are available on both if you are curious! The point is, I got in the next day for lunch with no wait (it was raining, after all)."
I really liked the feel of this place and the community vibe it had.  Deep dish was great too! Would be a regular here if I was a local!
"Deep dish like I've never experienced before.  A MUST TRY if you ever come to Chicago or if you're local take your friends and visitors.The crust is literally cheese... that perfect kinda burnt but ohh so tasty cheese.Seriously, Go!"
"BOMB.  Loved the 'caramelized' crust in the pan pizza.  What they do is put cheese on the crust so that it bakes to a crisp while in the oven.  GENIUS.  We got two medium pies for 6 people, and it was a hefty amount.  One was sausage and pepperoni.  The sausage was huge chunks and delicious.  The second was spinach and mushrooms.  Overall an amazing deep dish experience.  I've always favored Lou Malnatis for their cornmeal butter crust, but Pequod's may have risen to the top of my deep dish list."
"Loved the pizza! Good beer! And great music, country! We went here because if the amazing reviews while visiting Chicago. We went on a Tuesday night so it was surprisingly not very busy and the service was quick for deep dish! The crust, like everyone says, is amazing, especially the crispy burnt cheese part! The prices are more reasonable compared to some of the places downtown (depending on the amount of toppings you get at pequods). It was a fun place and seemed more for locals which I liked, but my dad said he still preferred the traditional giordanos, but I highly recommend trying both if in Chicago!"
"This is my go-to deep dish place when out-of-towners come to visit.  I have yet to find a better deep dish pizza in the city.App's leave something to be desired for sure, but the pizza is filling enough.Try to hit it up for their ridiculous lunch special if you're in the area ($5 for a single pan and a drink (can be a pint of Miller Lite if you'd like))."
"Pequod's Pizzeria is what has caused my addiction to pizza. Sure, I've always liked pizza, but never have I ever CRAVED pizza - until, Pequod's, that is.One of my friend's treated me to carry out from Pequod's because she's been RAVING about Pequod's so I was like 'sure, why not?' And, WOW. We shared a pan pizza with mushroom and it was amazing! Delicious crust and sauce -- MmmMm.And there begins my love for pizza....Went back and dined in with a few friends - it took a little long for them to make the pizza, but it was worth the wait. Definitely order yourselves some appetizers to hold off hunger pains - we ordered the cheesy garlic bread and it was so yummy - the bread was soft, but still crispy and very flavorful and cheesy. Will definitely order again!Plenty of street parking around noon on a Sunday."
"Pequod's is the result of taking all that is right in the world, baking it in a pizza pan with a caramelized, yeasty crust straight from heaven and having cherubim bless it as it exits the oven and slides down my gullet.If you love pizza the way we serve it up in Chicago, hit this place up. If you don't like it, consider cutting out your tongue because your taste buds have betrayed you."
"I have dubbed this place the best deep dish pizzeria in Chicago.  The caramelized crust is the biggest standout and is something that I have found myself craving in every pizza since pequods.  Additionally, their sauce, cheese, and toppings are just excellent in quality.  The vibe is a fun divey feel that makes it feel so neighborhoody and homey.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants delicious albeit less well known Chicago deep dish.  Once you taste pequods, the rest just taste so...regular."
"Please don't forsake me Lou's.  I really, really like Pequod's pizza.  Yes, the caramelized crust is just plain tasty, although I want the crust to be just a bit more crispy.  Shut it you pizza-whores, I KNOW it's deep dish....but, there's no reason the crust shouldn't be a bit crispier.  The sausage was quite tasty -- do they make their own or buy it?  Hard to tell, and didn't care as I was tearing into it like a rabid dog.Fresh fresh fresh ingredients -- thank you for using fresh mushrooms and not canned.The thin crust is more like a hand tossed crust -- thinn-ish, but more bready.  Same issue - thin crust NEEDS crispiness.  Unequivocally.  Do away with the twisted edge artistic malarkey; just give it a standard edge that gets crisp on baking.  Great sauce, really, just lovely.  A bit of sweet, a bit of acid, LOTS of tomato flavor. Was there on a Saturday early evening, and they were able to accommodate our rather large party.  But, please make sure the tables don't tip over - we had the bobble-head of tables, and had to keep the beer pitchers in the center for fear of bathing in it.  One star.I really enjoyed that the owner came around and asked us (twice) how everything was....what a nice fellow, friendly, and genuinely interested in what we thought.  I'm glad Pequod's re-opened after the fire."
Coming from a year of Ian's pizza in Wrigleyville...  The first night I moved to Lincoln Park my roommate and I decided to give this a shot. Bottom line this is arguably the best deep dish pizza I have had since moving here almost a year ago.  The caramelized crust makes the pizza.
"No chance there's any competition.  Their pan pizza is incredible.  I've never had anything like it.  I've tried it all.  Giordanos, lou malnatis, piece, homemade, ranallis (second fave) - I need to make some more money so I can open my own pequods and eat pepperoni and giardinara for daysssss.  Well done, pequods."
"This might be a little biased as during my first trip to Chicago, this place was recommended to me by the awesome staff at Equinox. Thus, it's technically my first Chicago deep dish ever.Nonetheless, Pequod's is ridiculously good for a deep dish pizza. I'm a die hard thin crust lover, but Pequod's made me think twice.I decided to order a small deep dish sausage and mushroom for myself. Good lord, I could barely finish 3/4 of my pizza. Great thick crust with a nice touch of crunchiness at the bottom. The part that really did it for me was the crust. It has a cheesy, garlicy taste that was ridiculously good.I honestly could just eat the crust alone. Great place, and now I have serious food coma."
Pretty dang good..They have a great lunch special!$7- I think for a small 1 topping pan..
"I have a weird, dual-CHI/NYC-citizenship friend. She's originally from Chicago, but made the move to NYC half a decade ago. So she's technically Chicagoan.... but much more a NYCer. She loves her new city, but craves the (better) food of our fair city.She was back in town and wanted deep dish pizza. The tourist-usual wouldn't do, as we wanted local flare~Hello, Pequod's! Waitstaff wasn't checking in on us too often, but we enjoyed that as it gave us girls time to catch up. The crust of their ""pan"" pizza is awesome. I was hoping for a bit more sauce, but the pie was good overall.We'll be back, P!"
Very Very Good sauce! Perfect balance of sweet and tart in the tomato. Don't know I didn't write this review sooner
"I love Chicago and I love chicago pizza and although I grew up in Chicago I haven't lived here in may years but I do get back on a semi regular basis.  Whenever I come to town I love to go to Pizzeria Uno.  The problem with Uno's though is that it is small and hard to get a table in a decent amount of time and the more people in your party the harder it is and longer it takes.  This being said I started to hear great things about Pequods.  I have to tell you I was skeptical at first because like I said I am a Pizzeria Unos fanatic.  I am so glad that we decided to check out Pequods this last trip.  5 of us went for lunch and we were walked through the bar which looked very cool and taken upstairs.  My first thought was this sucks, I hate being put into an overflow room but I found out that this is where most of the seating really is.  Because it was lunch we all ordered the killer lunch deal that they offer.  This is a one topping 7"" personal pizza and it was served with either a beer or a soft drink for only $4.99, what a deal! I still thought because of the price it was going to be a watered down version of the real thing.  Boy was I wrong.  Small but awesome is what I say now.  We each orderd different styles.  I had sausage, mushroom (extra .95 additional toppings) green pepper and it was loaded with toppings and a really nice quality sausage.  Everyone at the table thougt that they ordered the best pizza and every one of us walked away with a smile and a full belly.  I did notice a few tables with a full size pizza and I have to admit that they looked unbelievable and can't wait to go back.  I have told a few people that this is now my new #1 and will be my go to pizza joint whenever I get back to town. Fun atmosphere, attentive wait staff and  GREAT PIZZA! All makes this a don't miss stop. Look at the pictures, drool and then make your way over here as soon as you can and have what I now think is the best pizza in town!"
"Go at lunch! You get a personal pan and a beer for less than 5 bucks.Whhhhaaaatttttt? In Chicago? It's true.And DELISH.This could quite possibly be the best pan-style crust pizza I've had. yes. it. is. that. good.Loved the ambiance, the decor, the overall feeling I had when I was dining in.The server was top notch and sweet. Bonus points for that.It would make a great date night before heading to the movie theatre within walking distance. :)I'm a Pequod fan for sure. :)"
Pequod's Pizza is delicious!! Definitely an awesome Chicago pizza. I absolutely loved the crust. I couldn't give it 5 stars because I still think Lou Malnati's is my all time favorite.
Just adding another review for the legend Pequod's.. Hands down thee best deep dish in Chicago!
Delicious pizza! This is a true pan pizza not to be confused with a deep dish. The sausage was delicious and the sauce and cheese were loaded on. The sauce had excellent flavor as well. Two pieces completely stuffed me. The only downer is the wait but it was worth it. I will definitely be visiting in the future.
"This is hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago! Forget about bringing all your out of town guests to the other tourist traps... give them something they'll love and bring them here... I know i do!!!Im not even a huge fan of deep dish... I know.. gasp.. but if this place is mentioned in the mix of suggestions I will always say yes because it is that good! Im a huge fan of the caramelized crust... wins me over every time! Their ingredients are fresh and they supply an amply amount to each pie! I usually go with the sausage and garlic.... and i truly believe its the best pizza around! Dont forget the poppers... they're a nice treat to start off with!Also, if you can swing it for lunch they have a pretty sweet lunch special on weekdays from 11-3. For $4.95 you get a personal pan pizza with one topping and a beer or coke! Totally worth it!!!"
"My husband and I are new to Chicago and have been on a four month quest for the best Chicago pizza.  Last night friends-in-the-know took us to Pequod's.  Absolutely without question the best deep dish pizza we've had here.  What exactly sets it above the Unos and Dues and Ginos and Lous in this town?  First of all, the pie stands tall in the crust and stays that way, even after you cut it, and the sauce is really flavorful - not just tomato-y.  But the kicker is that fantastic rim of crispy slightly-burned cheese around the outside edge.  Great, raw-brick-&-timber atmosphere -- although they could warm up the upstairs room a bit.  There was cool music and a great vibe downstairs, but when we were seated upstairs, it was kinda silent.  One minor niggle:  the Caesar salad was just 'meh.'  Small for $9 -- definitely not enough to share."
"WOWWWW yum. We had a Caesar salad to start (amazing croutons for some reason), then garlic bread, then cheese/pepperoni pan pizza. SO good. I can't wait to come back :)"
"We were sent here by a local and wow, do I need to send her a million and one thank you cards. Talk about some of the best pizza I've ever had in my entire life... Nom.One note: It's a PAN deep dish pizza. From what I know, pan pizzas typically have a buttery bread that rises a little more than your average dough. So if you're life my boyfriend and expecting to find an entire dairy section worth of cheese on the pizza and no dough, you're in the wrong spot. However, if you come wanting some EXCELLENT pizza that's still covered in mounds of cheese and toppings, welcome home, son.The large fed us for two days and we loved every last bite. It was hot, it was gooey, it was thick, it was crispy, it was cheesy, it was spicy, it was flavorful, it was downright orgasmic. I'm normally the dissenter when people want pizza because nowhere but Italy has yet to make a pizza I can truly love on a regular basis... so it's probably for the better that I don't live in Chicago where entire paychecks would go to grabbing pies from Pequod's. Whew."
"Without a doubt my favorite pizza in Chicago. (Lou Malnati's butter crust is my #2).I'm a creature of habit because new things frighten me which is something I've thought about talking with a professional about, but I spend most of my money on food so that's a no-go, instead I just always get the deep dish style pizza, which is like artfully cooked in these insane, probably billions-of-years-old seasoned pans that Pequod likely rescued from the Ocean floor, and they're like one of Atlantis's treasures or something and they make pizza with an indescribably crispy, caramelized crust that will make you wonder why you ever ate any other pizza, then you'll likely invent a time machine to go back in time to reclaim those wasted non-pequod's-eating-moments so that you can have the unbridled satisfaction of saying that you only ever ate Pequod's (thusly rendering your initial motivation to create a time machine unnecessary and paradoxical, destroying the very fabric of space and time... WORTH IT!).  I can't speak to the service because I've never dined-in because I'm a recluse when it comes to Pequod's pizza; I prefer to sit in pajamas like some dead-beat, do-nothing and fist-to-mouth 8 or 9 times the recommended serving and it just wouldn't be polite to do that in public and my parents raised me better than that, so I do it in my room with the door closed and I only cry a little.tears of exhilaration and unabated joy.These guys don't do online ordering because they're Luddites and I'm cool with that, I just always pay in cash so I'm not even sure if they take credit cards, but probably they do because that's the American way and this pizza is as American as the name Pequod."
"Pequod's is a must-try!  Especially if you are visiting the Chicago area, and want to sample some great Chicago-style pizza.Even if you don't generally prefer deep dish (like me), you will certainly enjoy the deep dish at Pequod's.  You'll find more info on their site, and menu, about their unique deep dish baking process.  Their deep dish takes a while to make (I think about 40 minutes), but it's well worth the wait.  The toppings are all high quality, and they're generous with the toppings.  They also have a great selection of draft beers, including several excellent local brews.And don't let the long lines turn you off.  You can pre-order your pizza when you request a table, and it'll be ready shortly after you're seated.  You'll often see the owner at the restaurant, and he is really friendly and helpful.I've sorely missed this place since I left Chicago, and make it a point to go there whenever I'm back in town."
"The best pizza in Chicago hands down! Great service, delivers til 2 AM! Real Chicago style--"
"Love the thin pepperoni mushroom pizza!!! BUT, their deep dish is their specialty so if you are new to Chicago, PLEASE make sure to order the deep dish and get at least one ingredient. The service is eehhh. You feel the order-and-get-out attitude from the waitresses. I also don't blame them, because some folks stay for too long because of the games in the tv screens. For 2 folks, a small deep dish is more than enough. The slices are pretty heavy so don't order more! For bigger groups, just ask and at least this way, you won't have a lot of leftovers to carry around. The lunch special is amazing, so if you are travelling during these hours and can spare more than an hour, get the lunch special ($6 for a personal pizza with a beer/soft drink). Really good pizza so I always tell EVERYONE I know to try it."
"Haven't eaten in the restaurant but ordered pizza from here. Wait was a little long but we live a little trek away so it took us that time to get down there.Loved the thin crust. Deep dish was good but a bit bready for my taste. Carmelized crust runs on borderline burnt. Sauce was the winner for me. All-in-all, a sturdy place to order pizza."
Excellent food.  Service was good but slow. We highly recommend it.
"Solid deep dish. The crust is awesome, by carmelizing cheese around the periphery it takes it to a whole new level. Sauce was very good as well. Lots of flavor. We did a green pepper, sausage, onion and the secret ingredient my buddy Monte went with, fresh garlic. Solid choice. Ambiance would be best described as chill. I saw another review call it blue collar, which i wasn't too sure about. But it's just lacking any pretense or BS. In a good way. Ok selection of beers, so all in all we'll be heading back here."
"The spinach and garlic pizza is a revelation. Ha, ok, seriously, I've wanted to type something douchey like  that for a bit. I don't know what revelatory food actually tastes like, but the spinach/garlic does fucking rule.The pizza at Pequod's is so good you'll need a cigarette.The pizza at Pequod's is so good you will call it back.The pizza at Pequod's is so good you'd pay full price to see it again.The pizza at Pequod's is so good it should be signed to a multi-year extension.There's no place like home, except for the spinach and garlic pizza.In a game of paper, scissors, rock neither paper nor scissors nor rock wins, the pizza at Pequod's wins."
"I am definitely a fan of this place! I am not a big pan pizza person, but a friend recommended it to me and I was not disappointed. A medium pan pizza with 3 toppings is MORE than enough (we each took 2 pieces home as left overs). We got mushrooms, onions and sausage on the pizza and it was delicious. I would recommend this place and come back any time."
"My husband had been to Pequod's on a previous visit to Chicago, and he could not stop raving about the pizza. On our vacation, Pequod's was at the top of his list, but he was a little worried that I would be disappointed, that no pizza could live up to his rave reviews. He was wrong! Usually you enjoy one or two aspects of a pizza. At Pequod's, every element is the best you will ever eat, and combining all these flavors left me moaning with delight. . . the gooey, stringy cheese; the carmelized crust; the sweet, spicy sausage; the fresh meaty mushrooms. The tomato sauce was so good, I asked the waitress if I could buy a jar (no).My half of the 10-inch deep dish pizza was a little too much food for me, but I ate it all anyway, knowing that until we return to Chicago I will never experience another meal like this. This meal was as delightful as our $150 meal at Blackbird.Pequod's is generally very crowded, so you might want not want to visit during mealtimes. We ate there at 3 o'clock on a Sunday. The downstairs was full, and many people were eating on the sunny (and quieter) second floor. We found street parking only a block away. Service was friendly and efficient."
"Think of this as pizza hut on performance enhancers.  This is not your typical Chicago deep dish...it's not stuffed and the crust is extra thick.  The pizza is a amazing...with the little carmalized cheese..whooff.  They use quality ingrediants such as fresh mushrooms as opposed to canned, big pieces of fresh made ital. suasage, etc.  reasonably priced for what you get.The delievery takes for ever."
"On my first visit to Chicago, I tried a deep dish pizza and I have to say it wasn't the best and it scarred me until this restaurant! The deep dish pizza was amazing, filled with tons of cheesy mozzarella and amazing sauce. This pizza revived my appetite for deep dish! The carmelized crust was to die for. Overall this was amazing!I would definitely eat here the next time i'm around!"
"I normally try to avoid deep dish pizza like the plague. But after seeing a piece about Pequod's on some late-night WGN show, we had to check it out.Their 11am-3pm lunch special is a great deal: $4.95 gets you a soda and a 7"" personal pizza with 1 topping. I, of course, chose jalapeños and was not disappointed. Not too greasy like some I've had and the crust was just the right amount of crunchy. The sauce-to-cheese ratio was perfect as well. I probably won't go back too often (after not being able to stop eating the entire 7"", I pretty much hated myself), but I'll definitely say it's one of the best deep dish pizza joints in the city."
"I don't eat pizza often, but when I do it HAS to be Pequod's. The crust is to die for and I love their sausage! For the best deep dish in Chicago you have to come here. My brother lives in Australia and literally comes straight from the airport when he visits. For the hockey fan, the bar area upstairs is fun during the games (especially when the Blackhawks are on). Delivery is a good alternative for watching the game at home."
"Skip hour+ waits at popular Chicago pizzerias (Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Piece) and head over to Pequod's.  I'm so often discouraged with other Chicago pizza restaurants that don't accept reservations and won't even allow call-ahead orders while you wait.  Well, Pequod's is different.  Though all good restaurants have crazy busy moments, Pequod's seems to control the crowd better than most.  There are ample tables on 2 floors of space.  I've made the 30-minute call ahead, ""please put my name down"" reservation here multiple times on weekends and rarely wait longer than 5 min.  I've also walked in on a weekday night and sat down right away.  So I'm already sold on this place without even talking about the food!  Pequod's pan pizza is why you make the visit, with its rim-crust dark charred to give it a nice crouton-like crunch.  Pizza is heavy on the sauce, but when mixed with cheese, sausage, pepperoni, veggies, etc, isn't over powering.  Don't be ambitious and order a pizza larger than your appetite.  You'll end up with 5 of 8 slices to take home (though who doesn't love leftovers?).I've tried a couple appetizers and salads, which I liked, but there's no need to order them when a huge, thick, flavorful pizza is on its way.    No complaints about the staff, service or restaurant condition.  Pequod's is a pizza gem!  Always a fun place to go with friends as I'm sure a handful of them haven't been before.  Your small or large party will leave happy they came... and full!"
"I've been here on multiple occasions and I can definitely say I am a fan. They're not my favorite game in town, but they make a good pizza none-the-less. Their signature is caramelized crust on their deep dish pizza and that's what keeps me going back. My one gripe with this place is that I feel like the bottom crust is too bready in comparison to the rest of the pie. I get around this by ordering extra cheese any time I'm there. To my tastes, it corrects the ratio."
"Mmmmm Pequod's.  I've visited twice and been extremely impressed on both occasions.  First time: big group, big deep-dish pizza with all kinds of veggies, boozing it up in the back.  I don't like deep-dish pizza.  A born-and-raised New Englander, I like my pizza super-thin.Unless it was made by Pequod's.  Oozy cheese caramelized on the side of the pan, rich flavors...  I still think of that pizza pie fondly, and it's been about two years.Fast forward to January 2010: my boyfriend and I stopped in to get slices to go.  Thin crust with olives and mushrooms.  The staff were incredible!  They put up with our hemming and hawing as we picked out toppings, asked for slices, then changed our minds and decided to get a large pizza instead.  Offered us a table while we waited, which was really nice--D. took the opportunity to enjoy a glass of wine--and gave us plenty of little packets of red chili flakes and parmesan to go.  I've requested the bf for a return visit for my birthday dinner.  Mmm."
"Very good deep dish pizza. Different than some of the others (e.g., Lou Malnati's) in that its thickness is due largely to its crust rather than being stuffed with massive amounts of cheese. I didn't feel quite as sickly full eating Peqoud's as I did eating at other famous deep dish pizza places. And, despite the thick crust, Peqoud's avoids the taste and texture of pan pizzas. Not sure how they do it. I did miss that extra cheese a little bit, but overall a great option for someone who wants deep dish pizza but does not wish to endure the typical 5 hour food coma that generally follows a Chicago-style pizza experience."
"I will preface this review with having recently relocated from NYC, I have a different take on pizza than most locals here in Chicago (I know, I know...). That being said, I (of course) had their thin crust pizza- which was the best I've tried since being in Chicago. I thought they did a great job, and the atmosphere of the place was spot on. Once I finally get over the fact that I can't get Brooklyn style pizza here in Chicago, my rating will most likely move to 5 stars (just bitter!)"
Amazing pizza.  I wish I could live across the road and eat here every day.  Nice Blackhawks environment.
"With the glut of Chicago style pizza joints, it becomes very difficult for a place to distinguish itself let alone compete.  Most places have some signature styles, such as buttered crust, cornmeal crust, sausage patty, cheesy crust, etc. Pequod's is able to stand out by sticking to simplicity and just straightforward good quality that makes a neighborhood joint so enjoyable.  Their deep dish has a wonderful sauce, probably of which is the best I have ever tasted.  It has a depth and richness that scream homemade and undoubtedly has had a great deal of attention and time behind it.  Their meatballs are fantastically delicious and is something that I would put into my Lucky Charms cereal every morning if I could.  If they had a signature style, I would say that it is the caramelization that their dough undergoes around the uppermost edges from the pan itself.  Some may consider it burnt, but I enjoyed its additional flavor and crunchiness.  Sausage topping was nice and had enough of the spices and seasoning that makes homemade Italian sausage so enjoyable.I noticed that many of the tables were ordering the hand tossed, which looked good as well.  I was not able to try any, but if the table next to us had left any behind, my ghetto instincts would have forced me to take a slice."
"With our usual good foresight, we decided to head to Piece Pizza during the recent Wicker Park Street festival.  Turning onto North off of Ashland we noticed people were walking faster than we were driving, and decided to reroute our pizza choice to another- Pequods.  Being a Sunday night we assumed we would be seated rather quickly, but Pequods being Pequods, there was a wait.  We were told 35-40 minutes, which was spot-on.  It was also nice that we were given a menu to pre-order so once seated we would have a limited wait for our food.  Once seated, we ordered an appetizer and began our wait.  I really liked the simple atmosphere of Pequod's.  The bar is pretty centrally located in the eating area, but it is relatively bright and cozy.  The restaurant was actually pretty quiet and the whole place kind of reminded me of a pizzeria in Northern WI I would go to with my family after a day of fishing.  The salad and cheesy garlic bread we ordered were fine, mostly just tasty bites to tide us over in our wait for the main event.The pizza was awesome.  I agree with others assessments that the amount of cheese is less than some other pan pizza joints, but  I preferred it.  The cheese tasted less rubbery and more gooey goodness.  The sauce was also great with a tinge of sweetness.  Finally, the sausage on top was ample and delicious.... It really makes me rethink my use of turkey sausage in everything at home.  We ordered a medium, and were only able to eat 1 piece each (2 people) so we took lots of pizza home- a treat for the rest of the week.  I just really loved this place."
"One word: Amazing!! I've never been here before and have heard spectacular things about it. I'm a huge fan of Lou Malanati's Deep Dish. After having a slice of deep dish sausage from Pequods, it may have taken over as my favorite slice of deep dish. As the server was serving my date and I a slice, my mouth couldn't help itself my watering. The Crust has an excellent flavor and there isn't much of it. I am definitely coming back for more. Decently priced as well."
So of the best pizza I have ever had and you can not beat the price! So worth going here and the people are super nice!
"Great crust, I describe it as Pizza Hut on steroids, but WAY BETTER!!!! Great fresh ingredients and a cheesy crust that makes it stand out over the other deep dishes in Chicago!  Definitely a pizza not to pass up!!!!!"
"I've had nothing but great experiences with Pequod's Pizza... We usually get delivery, and it's always still delicious and hot when it arrives. The ingredients always seem fresh (green peppers! Not squishy!) and are definitely plentiful...We ordered a pepperoni pan pizza and jalapeno poppers last night, glorious! The above as well as the carmelized crust makes it my go-to pan/deep-dish pizza in Chicago."
"Plain and simple. My choice for the best pizza in the city. I always spend about $20 and get an XL pan, and it tastes wonderful. Have been actually eating here for about 10 years now. Unfortunately it has become very popular so now I just call and pick up."
"Best pizza in Chicago. Dining in and getting their fried jalapeno poppers and draft beer while you wait for your pizza is part of the experience. It can be busy, but it's worth the wait."
"Best deep dish pizza I've ever had! The caramelized cheese crust was delicious. Also, the salad we ordered had cheese on it cut into the shape of whales, an obvious nod to Moby Dick. I love it!"
"I visited this place in August of 2011, and I was just touring Chicago with some friends. We were first directed to go to Giordanos Pizzeria, as that being the tourist thing to do. Which is really good too, but upon trying Pequod's my perception about pizza was taken away. There hasn't been a day since I have tried Pequod's pizza that any other pizza I eat is just not as good. I recommend this place to anyone visiting or moving to Chicago. You can't get a better location and a better pizza than this."
"This is seriously the best pizza in Chicago!  I've tried Lou Malnati's, Amato's, and even Pizzeria Uno, and while Uno is the best out of those, Pequod's still beats it!The deep dish pepperoni was excellent!  It had it all, great sauce, spicy pepperoni, and gooey cheese. We live all the way by the HIP, but I seriously doubt we'll be ordering pizza from anywhere around our house.  Pequod's is worth the drive...seriously, it's that good!"
"Best deep dish pizza-ever. Plain and simple. Deciding factor?  I MICROWAVED (Eeek!) the leftovers the next day........and still loved it!  This isn't a freebie award either.  I have high deep dish expectations that I beleive both Lou Malnati's and Edwardo's meet, however Pequod's exceeds!Most obvious is the crust, blah blah blah.  You've heard it all.  BUT-too good not to mention!  You see the charred crust and swear it must taste burnt, but it just doesn't.  It's a chewy, cheesy, crispy piece of heaven.The best part of this pizza however is NOT the crust, but the SAUCE! My mouth is akwardly watering right now just thinking about it.  It is quite sweet-but not really sweet? I dunno, I do not like sweet sauces, but I LOVE this sauce.  The savory/saltiness of it is a perfect balance.Other notables: nice atmosphere, decent beer list, fair priceYUM!"
This place has some of the best pizza in the city. The real deep dish and not they typical you get from Gino's or Giordano's. The waiters and waitress are really nice but it can be packed on both floors and the service will slow up. The pizza is worth the wait and it is located in a very good place across from the movie theater. Make sure you get there early cause it will get pack but you have to go here at least once the food is great.
"OMFG! This place is pure digestive pleasure! I went here for lunch with a friend and had the lunch special. I had giardinera and spinach on my pizza and it was amazef***ing balls! If you like/love pizza... and you dont go here... then you probably suck. JK, i love you. I cant wait to come back. Only con was that the service was ""meh"""
"Love this place, both for take-out and dine in. Good service, there is a bar and some seating on the main level but a place for families and larger groups upstairs. The deep dish is out of this world for one reason... the crust! burntcheeseyvintagepan goodness!"
my roommate works there...so far ive had a personal deep dish sausage and pepperoni and so far i can say so far im iimpressed.
"Do not let the humble exterior of this restaurant fool you -- the pizza here is absolutely fantastic!A few friends and I stopped by here last night before our movie across the street. Talk about conveniently located! We were hesitant to check it out at first because the outside makes it look a bit run down. Imagine our surprise when we found that Pequod's is not only nice inside, it is ENORMOUS!The menu is simple and straightforward. You can tell that pizza is their specialty. Why bother with a large extravagant menu when you can instead concentrating on perfecting one dish? That's not to say there weren't appetizers/sides on the menu, because there were. We just elected to ignore them.The pizza was absolutely PHENOMENAL! We stuck to a simple, large pepperoni pizza. It was one of the best pizza's I have had since moving to Chicago 3 years ago. The large pizza (thin crust) was easily enough for 4 or 5 people. The best highlight of the evening was when the bill arrived. A large pizza, 3 sodas and a salad came up to $30!You'd better believe I'll be returning to Pequod's VERY soon!"
"I was told by a local hipster that this place is way better than Lou Malnati's because it's much less ""corporate""...Whatever that means.  Not wanting to seem unenlightened, I just nodded in agreement and decided to try it out.  The caramelized cheese crust was good on the first piece.  However, I found the sauce to be somewhat watery, which caused the crust to be soggy on subsequent pieces.  I am not a person who only likes pizza from one place and the rest suck, it's not the Cubs and Sox debate.  I don't think I've had a bad Chicago Deep Dish; some are just better than others.  I would rank Pequod's among the best, but not better than Lou's.  Maybe ""corporate"" is the secret ingredient."
"Great pan pizza. The cheesy crunchy crust is fantastic, sausage tasty with spices. Ordered take-out on a weekday evening, had to wait a little while for the pizza to be ready, though I think I arrived too quick so that's on me, but it's fine on the inside - TVs, lots of people looking happy with their food, and not too crowded."
"Chicago deep dish is awesome, but for me its a rare treat since you know...it's packed with cheese.  When I do eat pizza, I try to go out of my way to go to Pequods.  Its not your typical deep dish, rather a pan style with some decent toppings.  The crust is amazing and its just awesome.  It's between Bacino's and Pequod's for me."
This place was really good. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. I was on a road trip with some friends and we stopped in Chicago. We ate at this place. The toppings were really good. We had a pan pizza with sausage. The caramelized crust was really good. I approve of Chicago pizza.
"MMMMM sweet sasafrass this pizza is damn good!!!!  Good bless Pequods.  I really do love pizza (who doesn't really, maybe people who like to kick puppies)....and Pequods is fan-freaking-tastic.  To each his/her own, and I know not everyone loves this place, but I know FAR more people that do love Pequods and drool at the though of it as I do.  I typically order just a basic pepperoni pizza and find myself drifting off into a happy  place as I eat it....oozing with cheesy gooeyness, just the right kind of crust with the right thickness.  5 Stars."
"I heard many a great thing about Pequod""s, and thankfully they were all true.This place has the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, and probably will ever have. The pies are deep, but not too much. They're just right! The toppings are plentiful and thick and the way the cheese and crust bake around the sides will make you salivate or you don't have a pulse. The portions depend on how much you order. Most would say a small will feed two. Not in this city, babe! Unbuckle those pants and order up a medium or larger!The service was friendly for a place so crowded and popular. Folks from joints like Great Lake should take note; this place is succeeding where you are failing.Pequod's is certifiably good, Yelpers! Don't hesitate; grab a group for fun or sit alone and lament into food that will stop you from jumping into traffic."
"Great pizza. You may have to wait a while for a table on the weekends but it is well worth it. They usually have a couple decent beers on tap as well. I would pick Pequods over Lou's, Geno's Uno, etc every time.Wouldn't change a thing about this place."
My first time in Chicago and first thing I had to try was authentic deep dish pizza. I was not disappointed. The crust was airy and crunchy and the sauce was delicious. We waited about 20 minutes for the pizza to come out but I was told that it was to be expected since they make them to order.
"This is the best tasting thing that has ever been delivered to my home.  It is the best tasting deep dish I've ever had.  The burnt cheese crust is mind blowingly good.  I work out five times a week and would happily bump it to seven if I needed to eat this every day.  Order it now.  Get the sausage.  I am 90% vegetarian, but the sausage changes all that.I seriously don't think I will ever order deep dish from another place if this is an option.  Dying to try Spacca Napoli next!"
"Go here, it's that simple.  Go here and order the pan pizza and love it.  Come back and order the awesome sandwiches.  If you can't love a place like this, you may not be capable of love; use that as a measuring stick for your emotional breadth in life."
"Yummy!  Oh my goodness I wish we could have it a pie delivered out to California so we could have it again.   By far the best deep dish in Chicago, and trust me while we where here we were on the deep dish pizza diet.  Very Very poor service from our waitress but couldn't let that effect my taste buds. Amazing, phenomenal pizza!"
"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!First found out about this place about 1-2 years ago when i was hanging out with some cast members from Second City.  They recommended it and then my GF and I decided to go there one late night since they open til like 2am or something like that.  Frickin good pizza.    Have ordered a pizza from there from where i live, which is Lombard,  and it was worth the drive.  Yum.My friends and I always order pizza from here whenever we feel like some pie whenever we are in the city.  My last visit i also tried their cookies, that stuff is good too, big and tasty (that's what she said).  Anyway this place is great.  Love it Love it Mahal."
"I say...3.5 stars, but I'll round up b/c This place is yummy in da tummy.  I can see why it's a hit or miss among pizza lovers - but really, when it comes down to the perfect pie - it's more about preference...BUT i will tell you this...I am a thin crust lover...and I go gaga over the deep dish here.The crust will come out and look all burnt up, but it's so tasty and crunchy and adds that perfect punch to go along with the rest of the pie....mmmm goodness.  My only gripe is that beer is so damn expensive.  I supp I can always JUST get pizza here, but that's no fun...that would be like mac with no cheese...well, for me anyway =p  So I shall deem this as an ""occasion"" spot like a chill date night before a movie...well, that what we do anyway...but go on and do it too...can't go wrong!"
As you can read this place has a fantastic pizza. There are enough reviews to hammer that home already. A place really has to go above and beyond to earn the perfect 5 star rating from me. Let me just say it: $4.95 for a personal deep dish pizza AND pint of beer at lunch time!  Ermahgerd! Amazing!
"Go to Pequod's.  Today, this weekend, this month - no excuses.  Don't wait any longer.  Their deep dish pizza is to die for.  It might be the best in the city.  The sides of the crust are crunchy goodness.  The bottom crust is firm and can hold the mound of toppings.  We had a large deep dish with green olives, pepperoni, and giardiniera.  Oh my goodness.  Go here soon!!!And their wings - so tasty.  They aren't buffalo style, but are spicy and have a unique flavor.  If you do not devour them, my guess is that you are feeling sick, and therefore your hunger is impaired.  You know how it goes if you have the flu or another similar illness.And it is open late too!"
"It almost feels like a waste for me to add another review of this place... I would list all the same delicious things as everybody else who enjoys it, the crust above all else.  I love that they deliver (even though it's much tastier in the restaurant than after riding in a box for 20 or 30 minutes) and that they'll do half toppings, so I can split an enormous small with a meat eating friend.I think I could eat pizza every day and not get get tired of it, and if I ever were to undertake such an endeavor, Pequod's would definitely contribute."
"Great pizza, great service.  At first i didnt like it because it was different from what i was used to, but once i got over my bias i realized it was probably my favorite pizza in the city."
"I'm not particularly a fan of pan pizza, but I LOVE Pequod's.  I actually like their thin crust pizza better, particularly because of the delicious crust that doesn't overwhelm the ingredients, which, for me, are why you get pizza (not a crust fan).  The cheese is perfectly brown and delicious.  The sauce is fresh and light.  I just noticed now on their menu that it says ""The Best Pizza in the Universe.""  I'm not sure whether they got that from me, but that is really what I tell everyone who asks me where to go for pizza in Chicago.  I say you have to go to Pequod's because it is the best pizza in the Universe.  Sadly, I only get to enjoy it once or twice a year, now that I have moved to the pizza wasteland that is Houston, TX."
"Made a reservation at Pequod's for my birthday and the staff was more than accomdating for all 15 of us.  The pizzas took a while to come out, and they actually forgot to put in our one thin crust we ordered...but absolutely well worth the wait and they took off 50% of the pizza they forgot about...I actually almost forgot the negative experience because I enjoyed the food so much.As for the pizza, it's amazing...from the crispy, caramalized cheese crust to the delicious sauce and endless toppings..it's perfection on a plate. The pizza differs from Lou's or a Gino's, which is much appreciated! It was so refreshing to find a place like this, and not too far away. I will gladly return again and again!"
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, hands down.  As a Chicagoan I'm well aware of the fact that everyone's favorite pizza place is the best and to say otherwise is fighting words, but Peqod's pizza is really spectacular.  I am a regular fixture at the restaurant, eating there on almost a weekly basis, and the food is consistently good.  The best part is of course their trademark caramelized crust.  I've only ordered the pizza delivery a few times and can say that while its still good, you're much better off going to the restaurant and eating it fresh from the oven.  Like most deep dish it will fill you up quickly and a small is more then enough for two people.   After a kitchen fire a few years ago the interior of the restaurant got a revamp, so it no longer has the classic Chicago pizza parlor feel, but the atmosphere is still nice, and the restaurant is clean.  The restaurant is deceptively large with a second story with a full service bar, though I personally prefer eating on the ground floor.  The wait staff has all been working there for years and is friendly and courteous.  Service is also always prompt with multiple servers and staff members taking care of you during your meal."
"Wow. Best pizza, period. Only complaint is that it takes 45 minutes to make. BUT, it's worth the wait."
"That whale has a thong on its head.  This pizza is delicious... the saucy tangy sauce, gooey and stringy cheese, all necessary for pizza to be that good."
"I generally hate deep dish pizza.  A friend twisted my arm to go here and I've been hooked ever since.  This place has the best deep dish pizza anywhere.  Whenever friends visit Chicago, I always take them here.  Navy Pier, the Bean and Pequods, three must sees on any Chicago trip."
"I'll start out by saying that I had Pequod's delivery instead of in situ. Hey--it's freakin' cold outside! The pizza arrived warm and still caramelized at the edges, the salad was well-chilled, and the garlic cheese bread arrived toasty.Working from most disappointing to favorite part of the meal, here goes:The garlic cheese bread was cheesy, but at two pieces, it didn't seem like much. I also could not taste any garlic at all. Out in the 'burbs, if you order garlic at most restaurants, you don't have to search for it in the food. Dunno if the city was misnamed a long time ago, but ""place of the wild garlic"" doesn't apply to most restaurants recipes downtown.The Pequod salad was very large (definitely enough for two people to share as a dinner salad). I don't usually like a lot of vegetables, but the dressing was just enough to mostly hide the flavor of the black olives from my tongue.There was plenty of pepperoni on top, and everything blended together well as far as taste.The pizza was tempting looking as it was thick, juicy, and covered with pepperoni as well. Couldn't even see the other ingredients (sausage and garlic). Now this time, Pequods did not disappoint with the garlic. It was visible, and could be tasted too. I would've preferred a little more, as the sauce is a bit sweet. Not too sweet, as some reviews state. The dough was just about the right thickness and consistency for a deep-ish dish pizza, and there was plenty of each of the ingredients. I didn't taste the caramelized edge as I was expecting...maybe it's an acquired taste, but I just didn't see it as a big plus. It added some flavor, but it was just kinda' crunchy and burnt...but then again, I like my toasted marshmallows golden, warm, and gooey, not black and flavorless. To each his own taste! (Or ""Chacun de son gout,"" as the French would say.)All in all, a pretty good place for delivery. I think it would probably be even better brought warm and fresh right to your table from the oven, since the delivery took about an hour in the winter weather. If the result was this good, I can only imagine it to be better at Pequods proper."
OMG!! Absolutely delicious! Best Chicago style pizza EVER! This was my first time having a Chicago style pizza but I was with some experts on the subject and even they agreed it was the best they'd ever had. They had already had pizza four times this trip. Hands down a real find. This will always be a stop when in Chicago. Can't wait to go again.
First time trying the pizza. Got it delivered to our hotel room which took 90 minutes but was well worth the wait and the pizza arrived still hot. Thought the pizza was burnt at first but once I tasted the crust I realized it was caramelized which is what kicks this whole thing up a notch for me. It already has me thinking about when I can go back to Chicago and get more! Man I am jealous of my former self just thinking about it!
My favorite pizza in Chicago. Need I say more.
"When it comes to *pan* pizza--a largely overlooked style of pie here in deep dish heaven--Pequod's is God.Pan style, of course, is marked by its crust-centric presentation, and nobody does carbo-riffic, pan style pizza better than Pequod's.  It's bread-tastic: light, crispy, and the caramelized crust is perfection.  The sauce is just right: slightly sweet and not layered on too heavily.  And their sausage is the Best. Ever.  (And this is from an avowed pepperoni-only devotee.) And if you end up with leftovers?  They hold up better in the fridge than any pizza in the city."
Love this caramelized deep dish pizza.  Def call ahead for a table.
I'm a pizza lover so my friend suggested his fav spot he raved about the caramelization of the crust which I found out was code for burnt cheese. We walk in and the space can get crowded no different from other popular pizza joints seems like that's standard in Chicago the standing room can get quite crowded....and for an agoraphobe such as myself it took a lot to be there waiting on our table but a spot at the bar gave me some room. So the hostesses (mainly 1 of 3) at the front were kind of not very polite. They kind of stared at us when we walked in and didn't eeh greet us very politely. I did give her the side eye because I was a hostess at Unos and my firsts always were greeted with a welcome and a smile. I actually was going to leave just because of that but decided to stay as we drove all the way here for this pizza. But honestly it really did bug me. Anyhow the wait time is about 50 minutes again standard for Chicago pizza. We ordered the pan pizza with pepperoni sausage and some veggies but it was way too salty. We thought maybe with the meats it was overall yes but my friend assured me that he's had this pizza before and it has never tasted like this. It wasn't bad just too salty for my taste. Anyhow the service at the bar was great and our server was awesome.
"I've lived in Chicago for 6 years and for some reason had never gone to Pequods. It actually wasn't until recently that I realized how popular this joint was. I'm not a big deep dish fan, but I was excited to try their pan pizza. Off the bat, I really liked the vibe of this place. It had a chill sports bar kind of vibe, with no frills and great beers on tap. I was tempted to have an Oktoberfest on draft, but I didn't want to fill up my stomach with anything other than delicious pizza. We waited about 15 minutes for a table and were seated the second our pager went off. We split a ceasar salad as an appetizer and got a medium pan pizza with mushrooms, spinach, pepperoni, and sausage. I loved it! I loved that the crust wasn't paper thin like a lot of Chicago pizza's, but also wasn't crazy deep dish. We gorged and still had room for leftovers (which I obviously ate for breakfast the next day). Great spot! Little bit of a wait, but definitely worth it."
This is the best pizza west of the Raritan River. While visiting Chicago I had the pan pizza and the thin crust. The pan was a cheese pizza and the thin crust had the best sausage I had tasted on a pizza in years. I believe this is due to the fact that they only use quality ingredients at this restaurant. I also heard that they are on a pizza tour of Chicago. Thank you!
This was probably one of my favorite deep dish spots in chicago that i visited. Their sauce is amazing and their crust and toppings were above average. this pie does sorely need more cheese and slightly crispier crust. my perfect piece of deep dish pizza would be to combine lou malnati's crust and cheese to go with pequods toppings and sauce.
"Went to Pequod's with a group of 15 people. On gay pride day. They seated us immediately and gave us delicious pizzas in a timely fashion. If that isn't magic I don't know what is. And when I say pizzas, I mean six pizzas. Plus beverages. The staff was very accommodating even though our group was loud and obviously unexpected. Oh and did I mention it was cheap. Like $8/person cheap. For large groups, this place is a must-eat."
"Not the biggest fan of deep dish, but when the guests are in town they all ask for ""real Chicago deep dish"" being a good host I decided that we would try some different places that I heard of around the city. Pequod's was on the list and I was completely shocked at how much I liked it. I thought Art of Pizza was pretty good, but this is my new go to deep dish spot when people come into town. I don't know what it was...it was that there wasn't a ton of cheese, and don't get me wrong I LOVE CHEESE, but usually I feel like there is too much cheese in deep dish pizza. The sauce was perfectly flavored. The part that hooks you forever though is the crust. The dough itself is a good flavor, not too buttery or overpowering but its really the cheese melted onto the side of the pan that has become one with the dough. Its a marriage made in heaven. Talking about it right now makes me want to go to Pequod's for the 3rd time in a week...is that gross? Yes, but you have to try this crust before you judge.  Also, the wings are great too! Definitely get the wings, they are a little spicy and a whole lot of perfect.  They're a great appetizer if you can't wait for your pizza."
"Ahhh Chicago Tourist. I was once in your shoes. I'm only in Chicago for (insert amount of time), and I've heard about Chicago having good pizza. Tonight, we're getting deep dish. I envy you. You get to try Pequod's Pizza for the first time. I remember the first day I had it on a rainy day in June after driving and moving all day. That day began my quest (shared by many other Chicagoans) to find the best the city has to offer. I set the bar too high this first day, and have spent every pizza experience at some other place wishing I went with my gut feeling to order Pequods.It is the best pizza I have ever had, and I love it. I can't say the word Pequods as a suggestion. Once the word is uttered, it is happening.  I am sure I have spent $1000's at Pequods. I have no regrets. Sean is the manager and is almost always there. He is customer service embodied. In all of my experiences, I have had a few negative delivery experiences, and Sean has made up for them without blinking an eye. Also it has THE best lunch special in the city. For less than $6 (not including tip...don't be cheap) you get the personal deep dish pizza and a beer or soda. You must do this.So go forth Chicago newcomers, and enjoy."
Pequod's is the best of the best of Chicago Deep Dish.  I've lived in Chicago for over 25 years and used to have Lou Malnati's and Georgio's Pizza has my #1's.  Pequods takes the crown with their incrediblely fresh ingrediants.  The vegtables are hand cut and  the perfectly seasoned italian sausage is out of this world!  Lady's and Gentleman we haven't even got to their crust.  They have a Italian seasoned cheese halo crust which provides a similar crispyness as a buttercrust but this adds a bit more flavor.  I've had Pequods for both dining in and takeout and both were great!
"Best. Pizza. Experience. In Chicago.  The food, service and atmosphere is the best in the city by far.  Worth the wait on busy nights.  They are very accommodating and take a real interest in your needs.  Do not consider any other place for to suppress your appetite for pizza."
"Best Chicago-style pizza! I always recommend Pequod's to anyone visiting the Chicago area. A few people have come in saying ""Oh you need to try... (Geno's, Uno, Giordanno's, Lou Malnati's, etc.)"" But we bring them to Pequod's and they always change their mind."
"Really good pizza.  We started with a (very deep-fried) appetizer combo and then two small deep dish:  a garlic, basil, pepperoni and a sausage, mushroom and green olive. Very good and plenty for 4 people (two of whom are know for their ability to tuck away the pizza).I'm not going to weigh in on some kind of ""best chicago style pizza"" debate, but it really hit the spot.  The ambiance was also very pleasant and the server was attentive.  Five stars in the cosmic scheme of things?  No.  Five stars in the universe of pizza joints?  Absolutely.Parking absolutely sucks."
"I'm kind of embarrassed to say as a New Yorker that I've found my favorite pizza place in Chicago.Their crust is amazing. Caramelized chewy crust, beautifully cupping a sinkhole filled with sauce, cheese, and toppings. It's so flavorful. The appetizers were ordered were pretty forgettable - in fact, I don't even remember what we got. Just come here for the pizza.I came here with a group of more than 10 people and they were pretty accommodating. At first they tried to squish us into some tables put together, but then moved us upstairs where there was more space. Overall, the service was pretty good. So to sum up: good service, amazing pizza."
"Quite simply, I really don't care for Chicago's deep dish (being a NYC transplant and all), but - gasp - I actually enjoyed it at Pequod's tonight.  It mainly came down to the following: 1) not as doughy as all those ""famous"" chains, 2) no disgusting amount of cheese like those ""famous"" chains, 3) excellent sauce with a hint of smokey flavor, 4) caramelized edge (which I hadn't seen at those ""famous"" chains).  A sub-par beer list, however.  My avid beer enthusiast friend was rather disappointed with his choices of beers throughout the meal.  Next time, I shall try the thin crust and see how it compares to my beloved NY pie."
This is some of the best pizza I have encountered in Chicago ( and I live 1 block from most all of them). I ordered normal crust (which was amazing) light and a perfect blend of crisp yet soft. The pie looked as if it was given love during the process (kind of a french twist edge).  They are busy but it is worth the wait. I will have to give their deep dish a try next time.
"Best pizza in Chicago. If you haven't at least tried it, you're missing out. Go and get the lunch special, and I'll bet you're hooked on this pizza. I'd never had anything quite like it before."
"Although this spot is also a bar they have an upstairs that caters to kids which is great because we like to take our future yelpers everywhere. There is no words to describe to you how delicious this deep dish pizza is. It is a must go to if you want the greatest deep dish pizza ever. When your out late and you want to dine in for some pizza with your family, you must come here"
"Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.  And yes, I eat Pequod's, with cheese and all.The crust does make the pizza a whole lot better.If they could up the ante on the sauce (a la Art of Pizza), I'd be a regular.  Ambience seems cool enough, have not had the pleasure of dining in.The people working there rock...very nice and make darn sure you get what you ordered.  Once I actually throw down money on a box of lactaid pills, I'll be back with a vengeance."
"One of my favorite pizza places in Chicago, Pequod's serves up delicious deep dish pizza with a ""halo"" of crispy cheese instead of a bready crust. I usually get it delivered, a nice treat since I live in Logan Square. I recently dined in for a friend's 30th birthday. I found out that they have upstairs seating and a bar up there. It was pretty busy since it was a Saturday, but service was attentive and the pizza never disappoints."
"The deep dish is what you want here. Giordano's might be the most popular, but this is the best. They have really quick delivery too.Stay away from the thin crust and sandwiches, they're just okay. Salad was good though."
when it comes to pizza... i'm always down...I went here last week and the pizza is still on my mind!The deep dish is hands down one of the best I've ever tasted!  I can't wait to go back.  How can I explain their pizza?  The crust isn't over buttery but has a flavor of it's own!  The cheese infuses with their sauce and their italian sausage wassssss heavenly!The price was totally decent I think for a small deep dish we spent a total of 25 dollar with an appetizer!Give it a go!
"My friend who was born and raised in Chicago took me here to change my mind about New York pizza being better than Chicago pizza. However, when I tried the deep dish here, I was disappointed, not because it wasn't good, because it was delicious, but because it just doesn't compare to NYC pizza. I explained that if I need to eat pizza with a knife and fork, the concept of pizza was lost. Although I did get very full from just one slice. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. The beer cold and refreshing. The pizza fantastic. The price is right. I can understand why this place gets such good reviews and I did enjoy it, but it reinforced my preconceived notions."
Best pizza I have had in Chicago and I have been here for 2 years. Ill keep looking for other places but I don't expect to find somewhere better than this. The crust is a buttery blast of amazingNess.
"Yum. I found my Mystic Pizza. I was sort of hoping Julia Roberts would turn the corner and deliver my pizza while she yelled at her sister Kat for wearing her clothes.It has a family feel and its got that old pizzeria date night vibe to it.  Its got some great deals. Its near the movie theatre, so why not round out your perfect date night with a pint and a slice. Go to here please. Thank you!"
"Oh my gosh. Pequods has the best pizza I have ever had in my life. My bro and I met up with an old friend and he chose some ""pizza"" place in Lincoln Park. We arrived at the place, and judging from the décor outside, I wasn't expecting very much. I assumed this was just another pizza joint. We got there around 7:30 and we were a little surprised to see there was a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes, and this was on a Sunday night), but we were able to place our order. Considering the deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes to make, the timing would be pretty good. Anyways, we sat down, drank some beers and soon the food arrived. When I first set eyes on our sausage/pepperoni pizza, I instantly could tell this was no ordinary pizza. The pizza was littered with sausage and pepperoni, mixed in with a rich color of pizza sauce. I took my first bite and the pizza was just delicious. The crust to pizza sauce/topping was perfect; there wasn't too much crust. And best of all, the caramelized crust was amazing. I've never had caramelized crust before and I was just taken aback at how good it was.No other pizza place that I've eaten at before even compares to Pequods. I'm going to have to include Pequods into my list of routine restaurants to eat at from now on."
"LOOOVE Pequod's.  The only reason I cannot give this place five stars is because the pizza tastes slightly different each time.  Having been here over 10 times, this past experience was the best it prompted me to finally write a review.  The sauce was perfectly tart with the right amount of cheese and toppings: half pepp/half sausage being my favorite.The crust is unbelievable and I have no idea where they found the crust caramelizing wizard.  They probably lock him in a cage to never see the light of day as this sets it apart from all other pizza places I have been to, and is what keeps me returning for more.The Medium is perfect for 2 as you get a great balance of crust and toppings.  My ultimate favorite is the $4.95 lunch deal with pop/beer not only for the outrageous value, but for the balance of crust and the rest.  Pequod's doesn't skimp on toppings for the personal size which fosters its loyal following.i dream of Pequod's on a daily basis and am really bummed I can't go here tonight, despite having been this past Saturday.  It's that good."
"After having lived in Chicago for a few years and having tried many of the ""famous"" deep dish places I'll put it like this... skip them and go here.It's a funky place, when you walk in on any given night it seems like a sports bar that serves food, but when you get walked upstairs to seat for food (if you don't get sat in the front bar area) you'll see the nicer side of the place--but that's just the look. The pizza is the kicker, their thin crust is good, but you're in Chicago and you want pizza, that means unless you're headed north to Great Lakes then go for the real thing, the deep dish. The deep dish here is awesome, unfortunately, those of us who have tried know that delivered deep dish is NEVER as good--the metal pans they use for eating in-house are key.In short, don't go for the ambiance go for the deep dish, and if you are lucky enough to be taking a date who likes a good deep dish, take her (or him) along order a pint or two and enjoy the amazing deep dish Pequods has to offer."
Damnit it's the best! It's not even a competition.  All the other deep dish pizzas have lame butter crust nonsense.  This Pizza is special.  If you're a tourist go to Giordanos or Uno's and stay away from here so my restaurant doesn't get crowded.
"Thank u TL for alerting me to their insane lunch special...which is a personal pan (well enuf for 1 person) with drink at 4.95$.  Holy Moses, sweet Jesus, best deal out there.  And their pan pizza is still as amaze as ever."
Best pan pizza I've had in a long time! Delicious crust and reasonable prices. This is a must try!
"Amazing deep dish, like no other in Chicago. The sauce is thick but not chunky, with a robust flavor. The sausage is great, crumbled, not a sheet like at Lou's, which can be overwhelming. Great spices too. And the trademark caramelized crust was icing on the cake, it was delicious, I wish that the whole crust had more of it. Absolutely awesome."
"My very first authentic deep dish pizza! (Sorry Pizza Hut, I found out you don't count) Totally a recommend from a friend who lived out in the area who is a pizza fanatic (the guy eats pizza about 4 times a week and remains under 400 pounds, so I had to take his word for it) The place is cute and the local beer we tried gave us a decent buzz before we started to chow down. We got a standard deep dish, pepperoni with the caramelized crust. The caramelized crust was KEY! so crunchy along the ridge with a great flavor. With this being my first deep dish I wasn't prepared for the amount of food I was expected to consume, but according to my BF who grew up in Indiana this deep dish wasn't as thick as the standard (that terrifies me) In all I loved it but I wasn't impressed enough to say it was the best (plus it was my first deep dish, so come on!)Go Caramelized, you won't regret it :)"
"This is place you come to when you want pizza.Why you ask? Because that's the business they are in.They make pizzas.Mozzy stix were great, Bruschetta was bangin', the pizza was amazing.Lou's still tops my list, but this is 2nd in the Deep Dish game. Kinda how Biggie is 2nd in the rap game in my eye. 1st being that playa Pac.I like the atmosphere too, was cozy to me for some reason. It's the type of place you can come to after you Graduate from The Art Institute in the year 2005, instead of going to Weber Grill.Not one slice of pizza was left, cuz we couldn't get enough of that sauce and crust.""Do you know how to make sauce"" --C from Bronx Tale"
"Believe the hype about the caramelized crust. It looks burnt but it tastes way awesome. I was imagining how good this was going to be. When the pizza FINALLY came, I took a few quick pics and then I started DEVOURING the sausage and pepperoni one. Half way through the slice I realized, I wanted to save space for the crust. BIZARRO!!! Save space in my tummy for the crust?!??!?! Yes, it was awesome. I think I can just cut the crust off the entire pizza and eat the crust wheel.We had one large pepperoni and sausage, one large pepperoni, and one large Canadian bacon and mushrooms. The pepperoni and sausage was awesome. The sausage was delicious and flavorful. The pepperoni was nice and crispy. The Canadian bacon wasn't flavorful enough to hold up to the thick dough. While the crust on the edges was awesome, the dough on bottom was too thick. If it were half the thickness it would have been perfect."
"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!By far my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza. I didn't really feel like eating pizza but my out-of-town guest couldn't leave Chicago without trying the deep dish. We were gonna go to another more famous Chicago joint but Pequod's was highly recommended.Everything was perfect including the atmosphere. There was no wait and the service was great. The pizza had the perfect ratio of bread, cheese, sauce and toppings. Oh and the caramelized crust was soooo yummy!!! I'm definatly coming back"
"Coworker took me here for their lunch special ($5 for an individual pizza and drink) and it was KILLER. Have been back twice sinceFirstly, the lunch special is a wicked deal, but more importantly, the food was amazing. I'm not really one for deep dish - I find it a bit really heavy- BUT their pan pizza crust was this wonderful caramelized stuff, and everything was amazing. So I just gobbled it all up in no time flat.I know it's totally gross, but I ordered the individual pizza with anchovies on it and it wasn't just a salty mess like it is in many other places. It was delicious. My friend had a veg pizza that was also very yum. I liked their individual sized pizzas better than the bigger ones - More crust for me!!"
"Given the 400+ other reviews on Yelp, I don't think i have anything to add about Pequod's. I'll just say that the pizza is delicious, the crust is great, and the sausage is my favorite topping. If you like deep dish, try Pequod's, you won't disappointed."
"Normally I wouldn't review a place that has so many reviews already (especially when everyone basically agrees that Pequod's has the best pizza in chicago), but I'm posting and giving 5 stars anyways just to counteract the two reviews (Michael W and Tina) who gave it 2 and 3 stars, respectively, for being a crummy white sox bar.Um, how do I say this gently, IT'S A PIZZA RESTAURANT, NOT A BAR!Seriously, how stupid do you have to be to think this is a bar? How could you be confused, did you notice that everyone was eating pizza?  That every table had pizza menus, shakers, and napkims and forks? That the actual bar has like 5 seats which people only sit at if they're waiting for a table?  That the overwhelming smell that hits you when you walk in is PIZZA- not beer?If you're looking for a bar, go to a bar- there's one two doors down.  If you want to eat pizza, then go to Pequod's, you'll be happy.Oh, and they happen to have a great, albeit small, beer list too//"
I truly believe this is the best pizza I've had in Chicago.  The pan pizza is absolutely unreal.  By some miracle I finished the large pan pizza by myself and it was one of the best eating experiences I've ever had.  The mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders are a great add on but the pizza is absolutely the best!
"Absolute best deep-dish pan pizza in Chicago. Caramelized crust adds some char flavor and saltiness but doesn't overwhelm the pizza itself. Think Lou Malnati's times five (LM x 5 = awesome). This is just Chicago pizza done right, at an affordable price, with an incredibly large serving of food. A large pan and a few beers could easily feed a half dozen happy people."
"Another AMAZING pizza place if you enjoy deep dish delicious-ness!  Great place if you're craving deep dish.  The wait is a bit long, but it is well worth it.  I went a few weeks ago and split a medium deep dish with several toppings (mushrooms, onions, black olives).  The pizza had about an inch thick of cheese on the top and the toppings are plentiful.  The sauce wasn't overly sweet but had very good flavor.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area.  It will not disappoint!"
"Love pizza in general but especially this one. Great caramelized crust completes an equally delicious pie. But be ready, very heavy and filling due to the think crust."
"The pan pizza is a must with caramelized crust!!!! One piece is plenty as well. Atmosphere is friendly and comfy. There was an overwhelming pine sol scent in the restaurant, but at least the place is clean. Semi open kitchen and clean bathrooms a major +. Street parking relatively easy and non metered.  Pizza delivered doesn't lose any quality either.****And there is a M-F 11-3pm special for a 7 inch pan with one topping+cheese and a pop or tap beer for $4.95!!!!!  Crazy deal, missed it by an hour, oh well, hope you can make it!!****"
I was working across the street and seen they had a $5 personal pan pizza lunch special.  I don't even like pan pizza but it was awesome.  The crust was nice and crispy with huge pieces of sausage that wasn't overly greasy and loaded with thick chunks of onions. I loved the sauce and it had plenty of cheese.  One of the best pizzas ever.
"Great pizza. Had a pan pizza with green peppers and onions. Pretty good crust but the cheese was really great. Good ingredients and a really great atmosphere. Very chill place and the servers all seem to recognize ""regulars"".Only draw back...made my girlfriend's stomach upset afterwards (but worth it haha)"
"First time left a good impression. Had the lunch time special. Deep dish personal sausage pizza. Good cheese amount, nice sauce great crust and the sausage was tasty. It was excellent and the perfect amount of pizza (for lunch)..the service was good and attentive. The place is more of a sports bar with some flat screens and a couple of arcade games. The front windows open up during summer and feels great. I am def going back for dinner and a larger pie."
"My favorite deep dish in Chicago thus far. They bring out the pizza in the pan and the crust is good as well, which you don't always get. There is burnt cheese on the edge that is good too. There are plenty of toppings and sauce"
"The pan pizza exceeds all requirements to be called and considered a ""Chicago"" pizza. Excellent food excellent service."
I just love this place. The crust is amazing and there lunch specials are great. $5.00 for a big slice of pizza and beverage of choice (Beer included). Where else in this city can you get lunch for such a deal?
"Hands down the BEST pizza in Chicago!!!I live about 2 blocks away, so this is a go-to place for me...especially whenever anyone visits from out of town...we gotta take em to Pequod's!I work at a B&B and constantly recommend this place to guests and mark it on their maps.  They always come back to breakfast the next morning raving about it.  One NY couple was so upset because friends had told them to get Lou Malnati's...to which man referred to as ""cheese and dough""...so I told them to throw it in the trash and go to Pequod's the next night.  Needless to say, they were grateful for my recommendation."
"I was at a friend's house and another friend drove out of her way to Pequod's to get a pan pizza and was soooo excited that she had gotten the pie. Having tried their thin crust before, I was a bit skeptical about her excitement. She opened up the pizza box and there was a pie filled with sauces, mushrooms, veggies, and looking mighty delicious.Upon closer inspection after my first bite, I noticed that this piece of pie was not stuffed to the brim with cheese! In fact, it was made with plenty of dough, giving it a unique twist to the Chicago Deep Dish. I was very pleased particularly with the crust that was caramelized that had extra bite and super taste. I wish they delivered to my house!"
"I just recently started working in the city for the family business. I usually order out because i don't really get a chance to step out. Im not really a fan of pizza, its not my favorite thing in the world. Ill eat it if im hungry though. My cousin decided we should order deep dish from Pequod's for everyone at the office. Me not being a pizza fan, I wasn't too excited. As it turns out Peqoud's is DELICIOUS. I recommend this place to friends and family all the time. I've tried several other pizza places after because i thought maybe i like it because it was deep dish and i have never had deep dish before. Hands down, this is the best pizza i have ever tasted. It was perfect and the caramelized crust was just the icing on the cake. The pizza was also delivered in a timely manner and the delivery man was very polite. Great pizza and great service, you cant go wrong!"
"Decent deepdish. This is Chicago ya know.  So it is hard for me to say it is the best or even a runner-up, but it is pretty darn good.They don't have the sauce on top, like Girodanos or Gino's, but that doesn't matter to me.  I love that their crust is carmelized, but there is something wrong with the taste of the crust.  It has a sourdough kind of taste to it, but like it's sourdough not cooked all the way.  Well, whatever the reason, there's just something a little bit off about the crust and that was really the only downside. All in all this is pretty good deepdish and the service was great.  We sat upstairs and I was thoroughly impressed that the waitstaff got up and down that huge flight of stairs so quickly so many times."
Do you remember the apple pie scene from American Pie?  I would do that to Pequod's pizza.
Best pie ever! Seriously unbelievable. I traveled to Chicago from Texas for pizza and I was NOT disappointed. Excellent draft beer selection and service to boot! I am extremely satisfied and I have leftovers too!
"Just chiming in with the awesome for this place.  It is as good as everyone else says it is.  It is as good as I say it is!  I love going here in the middle of the week when it's not crammed full of people, just so you get to enjoy the excellent menu with a little bit of space.I will be going to Pequod's as long as it exists."
"Hands-down my favorite Chicago pizza place. We have a lot of friends and family visit from out of town and take them to Pequod's every time. I absolutely love the caramelized crust, it's what makes the pizza. We usually get the appetizer sampler or the fried mushrooms to start- as far as friend mushrooms go these are great. Service is always friendly, and every time we've been in the owner is there and makes a point to welcome everyone who walks through the door. I like the bar atmosphere on the first level. I like to sit there if possible. On about our third visit we were seated upstairs- which I didn't even know existed- and it's huge! Still a nice atmosphere and family friendly."
"You know how on TV they show the lonely person watching couples holding hands, walking down the boardwalk or whatever couples do, and the person is so envious and sad that they're not the one with someone's hand to hold? Well, I just saw a picture of a pequod's pizza and I got that same misty eyed, lovelorn feeling because of how much I want that pizza right now. I'm gonna go ahead and click the ""romantic"" box under ambiance."
"great food, inviting atmosphere, great staff... sure bet for your money."
"The pizza is as good as any place I've been in Chicago (or elsewhere for that matter). A tip -- order it with extra sauce. Sometimes they can skimp and being as thick as it is, it's needed. Sausage is fantastic, pepperoni is tops as well.The pizza takes a while so don't go here if you're in a hurry. Delivery usually takes just over an hour."
best pan pizza in chicago. if you have not tried the crust on this pan pizza you havent had pan pizza
Super dope pizza in a very cool bar setting. Probably the best deep dish in Chicago but one could easily just chill here and have drinks/watch the game. Love this place--will be back.
Five stars for the best pizza in my life.  Deep dish...gardinara and canadian bacon...i think.  Great service.One star knocked off for the tv being on so loud. They were playing an MTV channel very loud during peak business hours. You could hear every annoying commercial.  The band playing was some 'yeah yeah yeah's' wanna be band.  After that...good news...a live REM concert.I will come back here time and time again!
"Fav Street Reporter back again. Its been a minute, but you still love me and I still love you. Now lets talk Pequod's:So was with the homie Kelsey K. and she told me about Pequod's. Said it was really that deal.  So she jumps on the horn and orders 3 deep dishers for about 10 of our peoples. Damn near was a skeleton by the time it arrived it took so long (roughly 1 hour +), but once it got there......ddeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!!! (like when Red got knocked out by D-Bo on Friday). This deep dish is so chaotically hectic! The crust is perfectly buttery and the edge is black (as in burned), but there isn't one bite that is imperfect. Sauce is on point. Cheese and toppings are on point...its crazy.  Take it from me, your Favorite Street Reporter,  who is from Chi and knows a thing or two about Chicago deep dish. Pequod's may have quietly slipped in that back door and stolen the crown, pulling off the impossible.  So lets pay attention....straight up and down...cause this is only a story....from the real...Good talk."
"Barkeep @ Harry Caray's took us there. Least he could do after 4 shots of Patron Platinum.Told us you don't get deepdish here, ya friggin' tourist. This is the best thin in town. He was right. I think. Got to Harry's tavern at 1 for the game, drank til 6, cab to Pequods, eat, drink, coffee across the street, struggle to the Metra and sleep to Woodstock. Whew. Good first trip to Chicago!"
"Best stuffed pizza in the city - bar none!Went here for the first time the other day and was happy, stuffed, satisfied and may have gained ten pounds~!Had a spinach and tomato pie with soda and ranch dressing.  Great ranch dressing, awesome pie and a waitress who refilled our sodas immediately after they were half full (not half empty:).This experience was only made better by their large screen tvs which were showing ladies bowling, almost saw a perfect game (she missed striking out in the 10th), and golf in HD.  If it wouldn't have been after a fun night of drinking I would of been able to review their beer selection since they have a full bar and many options on tap.  This will have to wait for next time.It is right across the street from a movie theater too so next time may have to be for a dinner and a movie date.  Because pizza and beer go so well together...."
Thee BEST hands down. Wish you still had the graffiti covered walls tho :) OEMMGEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  I'm so hungry!!! Mmmmm... carmelized cheese..
"Perhaps the best deep dish I ever had. Service was pleasant but slow. Server not to blame, they just need more help."
"im sitting in my room watching college football hung over like a mother f, and im REALLY  REALLY craving some Pequods pizza right now... thick brown crispy voluptuous..pizza crust...mm!  fresh ass veggies on top of some luscious ass cheese. pizza paradise, perfection in a pan. yeh.... Pequods.... and a dr pepper sounds amazing right now."
"How can you not love Pequod's? I mean I'm not even a fan of (wait for it......) deep dish because I'm originally from NYC, but I'll always eat me some Pequod's :) the crusty caramelized cheese at the edges COME ON!! I'm drooling so, yeah it Mmm Mmm Good!"
"My roommate has been telling me for months now that Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago. The man should forever make my pizza eating decisions, as Pequod's was able to beat Gino's East as my favorite pizza in Chicago.The crust is what really sells me. It is crisp on the bottom with a bit of doughy satisfaction just above that. Then the sauce hits you with its full arsenal of flavor and tag teams your tounge with the other toppings that are generously arranged on top. For the cherry on top: that crispy, crunchy, not-burnt-but-also-a-little-burnt edge of the crust that gives this pizza a unique personality unlike anything else in Chicago. There are a lot of seats in this place but they all seemed to get full before we left on a Friday night, and I say if you have to wait on one of the benches conveniently located just outside the door the pizza you will soon enjoy will be worth your wait.The only complaint I have is that their beer list is a little short. However this is redeemed by being filled by microbrews (aside from the token Lite anyway) and pitchers are a welcomed option. Quality over quantity is an acceptable ideal for a beer list, so pour yourself a tasty pint of Dortmunder and get ready to try your new favorite Chicago pizza."
"Not your typical pizza in Chicago!  Excellent crispy crust, light amount of sauce and the amount of toppings were double than what I expected."
"Very crowded, seems like everyone knew about this place but me, lively pizza joint. We managed to snag a seat on a busy Thursday night and had a large-and-in-charge thin crust with veggies and half meat (for the carnivore in this two-some). Part of me thought the crust needed a little umph with some salt but everything else was delicious! Super nice servers. Great drink selection and music choices.What a fun place for a large group too! Will be checking this pizza place out more than once!"
"WOW!  For 8 years I have heard good things and finally I had the honor of eating their pan pizza.  I went for lunch and had their personal pan pizza and a soda for 5 dollars.  Yes, 5 dollars!  Best deal in the city.  I had sausage and jalapenos on my pizza and it was terrific.  The crust was perfect, the sauce amazing, and my toppings made it all come together.  I highly recommend this place and I may just go back once before I leave.  If not I will for sure come back when I visit Chicago in the future.  ."
"Even though we're Palermo's die hards, we just had to try Pequod's after reading all the awesome reviews.  We love Palermo's sweet sauce, and numerous Pequod's reviews said the same thing.  If you didn't know any better you'd pass right by this place.  The outside is no frills and doesn't look like anything special.  Inside, the staff is very laid back and friendly; how can you not love servers that sport g-string wearing wales on their shirts?!  Want a Pequod's g-string?  They sell them!   The first thing we noticed besides the fun atmosphere is the fact that they sell Tucher beer.  I don't know anyone else who sells this deliciousness in a bottle.  The only place Tim's ever had it was in Germany.  We decided on the infamous pan pizza which certainly didn't disappoint.  Yes, there was a lot of crust but that's what a PAN pizza is people!!  The delicious slightly burnt crust and cheese is as good as everyone says it is.  I didn't think the sauce was sweet, but that certainly didn't make it bad.We ended up ordering Pequod's do be delivered about a week later.  This time we went for the thin crust just to see how it compared.  The thin crust was also very good, and yes, less crust.  Tim ended up ordering it last weekend, once again he ordered the pan.  We were afraid the pizza wouldn't be as good as it is when you eat in, but I saw little to no difference.The consensus?  Tim likes the pan better than Palermo's, but he thinks Palermo's is better when it comes to thin crust.  As much as I like Pequod's I still have to stand by my ol' favorite...Palermo's.  I certainly won't pass up an invite to go to Pequod's though, and next time I'm buying one of those g-strings."
Delicious pizza and open late! That is a winning combination to me. I love that they are open late at night and their pizza is outstanding. I have taken many dates to Pequad's and they are always impressed! Friendly service and usually the service is pretty fast(expect it to take longer if you order the awesome deep dish with the carmelized crust!). I am not that crazy about their spaghetti and meatballs though.
"I regularly order Pequod's for delivery.  The pizza is some of my favorite in Chicago, and it never seems to cost as much as delivery from most other pizza joints."
"I am not a pizza lover. Ironically enough, as someone who grew up in Chicago all of her life, I'm not an avid deep dish pizza lover. I don't despise pizza, it's just hardly ever something I crave. However, Pequod's was amazing! I loved how crispy the crust was! My out-of-state friends are wanting to try deep dish and I had no idea where to take them until I had Pequod's! Plus, it doesn't hurt that they're a Blackhawks bar!"
"So I went here with a friend who had moved out of Chicago...I think I walked about 10 miles to get here...no joke. So after my crazy hike across freakin' Chicago, we arrived at Pequod's.Service was so nice! and the famous crust was worthy of fame. So freakin' good! One of those eating experiences when you wish you weren't with a boy you liked so you could just go pig-crazy and chow down with abandon...stupid cute boys *angry face* ruining my meal!"
"A place with over 800 reviews doesn't need mine. But I'm gonna anyway, because Pequod's is part of why Chicago is awesome (to me).You know how some people get hung up on ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends? They remember past relationships so fondly that every relationship from then on gets compared to that ""one."" Yeah. That's pretty much how I feel about Pequod's. This was the first deep dish pizza I had when I moved to Chicago a year ago and it might as well have been the only deep dish pizza I've had. Sure, I've come across others during my time here, but nothing compares (cue Sinead O'Connor's bald head here). Sure, the atmosphere is very Chicago sports bar-y, but you'll forget all about that when that tomatoey, cheesy, and whatever other toppings-y slice hits your taste buds. I don't know how they do it, but the caramelized crust is perfectly cheesy, crunchy, but chewy at the same time. I could seriously eat an entire pizza, of just caramelized crust. I don't know what that would look like, but I don't care, I want it in my belly. As for the rest of the pizza, they don't hold back on the toppings, and you'll eat until you're painfully full, but still want to eat more. It's just that good. The pizza, beer, and service is great, and even though this is such a popular pizza spot, they've maintained a hometown, local feel, which I love. So play roulette with the topping choices, they're all pretty dang delicious. Just eat here, and get hung up on their pizza like I am."
"Pequod's Pizza is simply good as hell. (provided you think hell is awesome, like I do. I am Ronnie James Dio, after all) The pan style saaaasage, (Ditka), Peperoni, and Peperoncini pizza truly kicks ass. I highly recommend that you purchase this foodstuff. This place definitely competes as a top choice when ordering Chicago style pizza. I stand behind this good review, and hope that Pequod's will supply me with a free pizza for my efforts."
"Pequod's is top quality gourmet pizza.  My mom is Sicilian, so I was raised on artisan pizza.  At Pequod's it is all about the sauce and the crust.  Most pizza in Chicago is a boat of cheese.  Pequod's goes lighter with the cheese, and in my opinion gives the perfect amount.  Their crust is crisp and flavorful (made in a cast iron skillet) and I highly recommend the mushroom.They also deliver farther west than most other pizza places on the east side.GO PEQUOD'S!"
"Just like the Morton Grove locale, but a little more ""bar scene"" and a little less ""hole-in-the-wall""...yelp.com/biz/pequods-piz…"
"My favorite Chicago deep dish pizza!  It may not be the ""traditional"" deep dish, but I think it tastes the best.  You gotta love that slightly burnt, caramelized pan pizza crust.  It's kinda like Pizza-Hut-meet-deep-dish (but better tasting).  I really like the large chunks of toppings.  The red sauce complements the crust and the toppings well.  Unlike Giordano's or the other big name pizzas, Pequod's isn't loaded with cheese.  That's a good thing - it's nice to be able to walk somewhat after a meal, rather than being immobilized with cheese in your veins.  It's also cool that Pequod's still remains more of a local restaurant than a huge chain (like the other Pizzerias) that is expanding to every suburb known to man.Recommendations: gotta get deep dish, be prepared for a wait unless you go early, and order some meat toppings even if you're a vegetarian :)"
My lord does this place have it's own unique style of deep dish pizza?! I love a pizza place that has it's own style. 1 slice and I'm usually pretty good. It is hard to stop at 1 slice however. 2 slices and I'm stuffed.On a side note: The pizza reheats really well too. I highly suggest this place to anyone looking for a new taste in pizza.
Great pizza. Burnt crust is delicious.
"Best deep dish and thin crust in Chicago. I discovered this place by word of mouth I haven't stopped going. If you like a sausy deep dish with a crusty cheesy edge, then you have to try it out. If you are a meat lover on your pizza, then you have to try the sausage. Although the place looks small on the outside. There is plenty of room for a large gathering upstairs.Whether you are a local or out of town-er, you have to stop by and try Pequods."
"Amazing.  Fresh, tasty ingredients.  Everything is well-balanced.  It's nearly impossible to say what the best pizza in Chicago is, but this has to be up there on most people's lists."
"Overall a very good pizza place!  Prices are reasonable, wait staff are very friendly and prompt, and food is good!  The pizza crust wasn't my favorite in Chicago, but it was a HUGE pizza for the cost and the toppings and all else were great!  I'd definitely recommend this place over D'Agostino's or some other family pizzerias."
"I know, I know...you've probably read that same phrase on every yelp pizza place review. But this is the real deal, and I'll tell you why.First off, I live in Bridgeport...so pizza has to be FANTASTIC for me to drive to the north side. Second, they know how to make a real pizza! The caramelized crust is the perfect combination of baked/burnt/carmalization goodness. Also, they know how to put on the toppings. When I want sausage, I don't want little pea sized nuggets of ground beef mixed with table salt and pepper thrown on.  I want god damn chunks! A ballet of cheese and toppings and I want to see burned/backed tops as if the sausage was cooked on an open pit flame grill....Pequods does it.I went there recently with a small group of friends and we experimented with a Green Olive, Anchovies, and Jalapeño pizza....WOW! AWESOME!Now the interior does get to be a little sports bar like, but I'm here for pizza so I could give a crap about what game it on. The waitstaff is young and sometimes they're on the slow side...but its pizza! You sit down, order a beer, order the toppings you love...sit and enjoy the greatest pizza you'll ever have."
"""Our deep dish is baked in cast iron pans blackened by decades of seasoning. The overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.""  - PequodsOkay, Pequods, your prose is worthy of your namesake Melville. In fact, ""a halo of caramelized crust"" is almost poetic. But tell me this: WHY IS THE WHALE WEARING A THONG ON HIS HEAD? The possibly obscene answer to this riddle went unexplained, none of the waitstaff knew the reason.When you walk in, you see the neon sign with the whale and this pink thing, figure it must be the whale is eating a slice of pizza. Then on the poster inside, looks kind of different... is this some species of whale with unusual natural markings on its head? No, turns out that it's a thong. There must still be someone around from the good old days who knows the origin of the story. This place is classic Chicago, has been in business since 1970. Actually it's partly a sports bar, with TV's showing all of the local sports games, especially the Blackhawks. Beers on tap included Sam Adams, Goose Island, Half Acre, and Stella Artois. Served cold, cold, cold, in chilled glasses. They have big neon signs of all of the major breweries, as well as lots of signs and paraphernalia for the sports teams. And there are some classic movie posters - Cary Grant, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, etc. Some of the other posters look like enlargements of family photos from the 1970's.There are two levels, the layout is kind of narrow but the second floor adds a lot of space. It's more quiet up there when the ground floor gets bustling, and it has its own bar. Open late. The menu is simple, the whole thing fits on one side of a laminated card. They have pastas, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers in addition to the pizza. Not cheap but not expensive, either. There are wooden chopping blocks / serving boards on the tables which are cut in the shape of whales. They really do have their own style of pizza going on at Pequod's, it's not quite like any other Chicago deep-dish. Personally I thought the ""caramelized halo"" was good, they intentionally let the cheese get slightly burned around the edge of the top. The rest of the crust is thick and fluffy. The sauce is rather plain, doesn't have much taste of its own, so recommend adding some ingredients. Fun and unpretentious place with what most people will agree is good pizza. The style may not be to everyone's liking, you would have to try it to find out, since it's fairly unique. Ladies, beware of whales suddenly surfacing in unexpected places. ""There she blows!--there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!""- Melville"
WOW!  The caramelized crust on their deep dish is unbeatable!  Great microbrew selection.
"People, I do not mess with deep dish pizza. It's an art. Too many toppings and you lose the aesthetic. Too little sauce and you have to chew the cheese for a solid 5 minutes. Soft crust? Pff! What's the point? I could go on for a long time on this topic, I'll spare you.Based on the one slice of Pequod's tomato basil pizza generously passed to me by Lou the barmaid at Nisei Lounge one chilly February evening, I was solidly into it. I reserve the last star for a visit, as this was only delivery, but the cheesy crust thing kinda won me over. Solid."
"Pretty good pizza. On par with Lou's, but not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. The inside of the restaurant is huge, so that was nice."
"Let me preface this by saying I am a fan of New York pizza, and I don't consider Chicago Deep Dish (only 1 year older than the twinkie) to really be pizza.That being said this place was pretty decent.  We asked if the dough was vegan, and they said it was, and with no cheese that means no caramelized.  Crust was okay though, a little dry for me.  Sauce was good, toppings as well.  Next time I may get normal/thin crust.  One waiter told us he loves putting the vegan parm on his pizza at home, but I don't think they had any here.  They should get some Teese here!  I like having the oregano and red pepper on the table without having to ask.  Staff was amazingly friendly and nimble despite the thick Saturday evening crowd.  People were packed to the gills but I didn't feel cramped and the volume of the was still ok enough to have a conversation."
I love Pequod's probably as much as I love my family. Deep dish with sausage is the way to go.
"Came here on the recommendation of the sales rep at the Oakbrook Tesla store.  As she promised, the pizza was fantastic.  We went on a Tuesday night, after the rush..  no waiting.  Since we came in from out of town (escape from dreaded St. Louis style Imo's land!), it was nice to try a new place and still get that Chicago deep dish that was on our must do list for our trip.  Also nice to not go to one of the big chains for a change."
Got the pan pizza to try out Chicago style pizza but didn't like the deep dish style.  I think I'll get the thin crust next time.  The sauce was pretty tomato-ey and the sausage mixed in was pretty darn good.  The dark crust on the upper edge of the pizza was sooo delicious- crispy and burnt looking but probably won't kill you if you don't eat it that often.
"AMAZING PIZZA with an unforgettable crust that is what dreams are made of.  This, of the two locations, has more of a younger crowd and is much larger than their morton grove location.  I find that my boyfriend and I frequent this location when we are looking for more of a fun date night and we go to the Morton Grove location when we are looking for something a little slower-paced.   Both locations are spectacular and there hasn't been a time that I've visited where the owners haven't been there to greet me with a smile.  bottom line, you want good pizza, go to pequod's...NOW!"
"Pequods pan is awesome. I go with just cheese and it has more than enough flavors. The caramelized crust or cheese or whatever it is, is nothing short of amazing. The sauce is on the sweeter side, which works well for this particular pizza. I have ordered delivery and eaten at the restaurant and both were terrific. When you order delivery they cover it the pizza with foil and then put it in the box, keeps everything fresher, a nice touch by Pequods.FYI, I wouldn't quite classify the pan pizza as typical Chicago style deep dish, but it is just as good. They also have a great beer selection if you eat there."
This is in my top 5 favorite Chicago pizza places. The carmelized crust IMHO is why we go back and what sets it apart from my other favorites in the area. We usually order sausage and sometimes extra tomato and basil.We always order in (except for when company is in town) so that we don't have to wait for a table and pig out without being judged :)
If you love deep dish and loads of toppings this is your place!  I usually go for the lunch special.  How can you caomplain abot $5 for a pizza and a beer ( or soda if your scared).  Try it for lunch then once you are hooked go there before a movie and go to sleep in the seats!
"Good choice if you're looking for an atmosphere that stands out among the more known pizza places.  I have been a few times and enjoy the traditional crust more than the deep!  If you're not in the mood for deep dish, give Pequod's traditional crust a try!"
"oh wow, this pizza is awesome. so delish. cant want to go back. The crust is the bomb and the sauce and ingredients they use are so fresh. go give it a shot, you wont regret it."
"Hands down, my favorite deep dish in Chicago, or anywhere. The place itself is huge and often you will still find yourself waiting to seat. Who cares, get a beer and realize you're about to eat the best pizza ever. Delivery is fast. Price is not ideal, but I get what I pay for..... I actually have some in the fridge for later as we speak"
"When some friends from CA came to visit they wanted to try the famous Chicago deep dish pizza so I scoured the internet for the best of the best.  I chose Pequod's because the crust sounded special and it was clearly thought to be in the top 5.I wasn't disappointed.  We went on a crowded Saturday night and they were all over handling the crowd. It didn't really take long to get seated and the waiter was very good. We enjoyed some brew and waited for our delicious pizzas. Mine was a vegan version (no cheese) and delicious.  I would love love it if they had vegan cheese though. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers.The atmosphere was very bar-like and laid back. Fun and loud but not too loud. I will definitely be back!"
"Pequods is my favorite deep dish in the city.  It's next to Webster Place Theater, so often a go-to before or after a movie. (In fact, that's girls' night this week!)  It's a really big restaurant, with lots of TVs. It's roomy and lively.  There is a main floor and upstairs. (I like the upstairs the best.)  The deep dish is delicious. Yum. I love the sauce and the crust. I like getting extra sauce."
"Hands down my favorite pizza in the city. My hubs and I probably eat here twice a month. I take everyone who visits here and they always love it. Delivery is fast and service in store is always good. In fact, just thinking about it makes me want to go order some..."
"Peqoud's is hands down the best pizza in the city! We bring all of our friends here, and each and every one of them becomes a fan. The deep dish is amazing, and the caramelized cheese crust takes it to another level."
"I've had giordano's, Lou malnatis, and Gino's east. Nothing is as good as Pequods. Very happily surprised!!!! The other three rely on tourists to keep themselves afloat.... Pequods is just good on it's own. The only place I'll be going for deep dish from now on"
"I'm usually a thin crust girl when it comes to pizzas, but I'd heard rave reviews about Pequod's and had to try the pan to see what all the fuss was about. If the review were just for the pizza, I'd give it 3 stars. It was good, but nothing I'd run back for, though the ""caramelized"" cheese around the edge of the crust is my favorite part. It was definitely plentiful and a medium pizza lasted my boyfriend and I two meals. The crust doesn't reheat very well, though, so I'd recommend only ordering what you think you can finish. The sausage was good, crumbled and fresh with just the right amount of spice. It was a little bready for my taste, though. The reason I'll be back is for the good service and good beer. We were seated right away on a busy, Saturday night, upstairs and in a back room I didn't know existed. Still, the atmosphere was lively and fun. There were lots of tvs showing various football games. The beer list was pretty good for what I was expecting. A few craft beers make the list, and we shared a reasonably priced pitcher of Great Lakes beer while waiting for our pizza. We had a great night and a great dinner there, so if I'm with someone who has a hankering for thick, pan pizza, I'll point them in the direction of the neon whale with a thong on his head."
"Ok, so I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza. That's right, I said it.Anyway, an old friend came in from out of town and naturally wanted to get some Chicago style eats. Pequod's was her choice, I was just there for the conversation. Turns out that this is THE ONLY deep dish pizza that I've ever enjoyed. The caramelized cheese crust was awesome, but what I really liked was the fact that this wasn't just a pie crust filled with cheese, as I've had at many other places. The dough was fluffy and soft and the bottom of the pizza was super crispy.  All and all it was a damn good pizza. The service was great as well. Pricey beer, though. And just to clear things up - their mushrooms are NOT canned, as one other reviewer had said (all of our toppings were super fresh and yummy.)I may go back there someday if I'm ever wanting deep dish, but I don't really see that happening. Hey, at least now I know that I don't find all Chicago style pizza inedible! Kudos, Pequod's."
"How have I never reviewed this place? The 700+ reviews speak for themselves and I don't have anything original to add. This pizza is GOOD. The ""caremelized"" cheese (read: burned) around the edge of the crust gives their deep dish pizza a unique flavor. I like the kind of chaotic bar atmosphere as well. Great place!"
"Loved this place! While were vacationing in Chicago we decided to eat as much deep dish pizza as possible.  For my boyfriend, that was easy, but for me as a vegan it was not so simple.  At Pequod's the waitress was super nice and had no problem with my request for a deep dish pizza minus the cheese.  She explained how they caramelize the crust using cheese, but said they could skip that for mine. So nice.  I got the vegan version with green peppers, onions and spinach.  Fantastic! My boyfriend got pepperoni.  We each ordered smalls instead of personals and the waitress warned that it would be a lot of food and we would have leftovers.  I told her not to be so sure.  My boyfriend managed to eat almost his entire pizza, and I took one piece back to the hotel (where I ate it later).  This place was very casual and had a great vibe.  The pizza was fantastic.  We will definitely go back if we are ever in Chicago again."
"Let me preface this review by saying I do not like deep dish pizza. I know, I know.  I LOVE Chicago hot dogs, the Cubs, Bears, and Bulls, so don't take away my residency just yet.  I even like the Sox, except when they play the Cubs.  But, I digress...Even though I've previously professed my dislike for deep dish pizza, I really truly like it from Pequod's.  I'm not sure what it is about this particular kind.  The crust is charred on the outside, and isn't too buttery.  There's a great flavor that I haven't been able to get from any other places.  For my buck, this is the best deep dish pie in Chicago hands down (and I've tried many)!  As someone else mentioned, they have a $4.95 lunch deal for a 7"" personal pizza and a drink.  That right there has caused many many a guilt-inspired trip to Bally's across the street.  But, it tastes so good at the moment!Check it out.  The price is good, and you won't be disappointed."
This place is delicious. The best deep dish I've had by far.
"The first time we had Pequod's was after many hours spent at Webster's Wine Bar up the street.  Granted, we were starving, but what came next was just silly good.  Pan pizza with black olives, sausage, pepperoni, and fresh garlic.  Pitcher of Blue Moon and the four of us were set.  That was 2 years ago.I've ordered in advance to pick up to take back home to the W. Suburbs (try driving 50 miles in rush hour with THAT aroma in the car), brought visiting family here during a very crowded Friday or Saturday, dropped in after a Sox game, it's always been good.  Make no mistake, I have not yet tried the thin crust, only the pan.  Don't go here expecting the original Pizzeria Uno / Ike Sewell / Rudy Malnati deep dish formula from 1943.  You know, the Lou Malnati's formula (my 2nd place).  It's a variation, so I don't know if you can  call it ""deep dish"" in the traditional sense, but ""pan pizza"" fits.  The crust is thicker, there is slightly less cheese, and they don't use a manhole cover of sausage.  And, luckily, there is no cornmeal in the crust.  The sauce is sweeter, resembling sauce from Aurelio's or Chicago Dough Company from down in Richton Park.  The ingredients are always fresh, and the service is always fantastic.  The manager is out there seating people, taking orders, bringing out pizza, checking in on you.  If you go to Pequod's with an open mind and not expecting the traditional formula for deep dish, you will not be disappointed.  It's simply a fun place."
"I hadn't had Pequod's Pizza in years, it is just as awesome as I remembered.  It is good to know some thing's never change.  You know it is truly good pizza when the cheese pizza is a satisfying choice, but when it come to toppings there is no skimping."
Almost speechless at how good this pan pizza is. We love them all but the chunks of sausage were huge making my 'crazy about meat' husband very happy.  Crust melts in your mouth.  Tuesday night was a good time to go compared to weekends where I can imagine this place getting packed.  Service is just fine.
"This deep dish pizza is amazing.  I dream of it pretty much on a daily basis.   If I had to pick a last meal before dying, this pizza would be it."
"Great pizza, fun place, lots of TV's and great pizza (can't say that enough).Can get slammed and crowded so not a lot of room to stand around and wait but its so good it doesn't really matter."
"ive right around the corner from pequods, so im loyal to this place.  but besides the convenience factor its seriously the best deep dish/pan pizza ive ever had.  I recently discovered ordering extra cheese to it makes the pizza even better! Im a creature of habit and almost always order my pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese, sometimes ill venture out and get mushroom, sausage and spinach. Either way, you can't go wrong! The crust is a carmalized  cheese, which happens due to the pan they use (or so i read somewhere) its nice and crispy.  This place gets slammed on game nights, especially during hockey season....actually i think its safe to say its slammed every friday/saturday/sunday night. The pizzas typically take 30min to make so call in ahead and make your drive or order when you get there and enjoy a beer or two at the bar.  They serve thin crust as well, pretty good, but i go here for the pan/deep dish...i tell everyone visiting or new to chicago that this is the plac to go to for good chicago pizza.Oh just to add pretty decent lunch special, i think its $5 for a personal pizza and drink."
In the city that perfected pizza - Pequod's is perfect pizza.The service is always friendly and quick. The pizza is amazing.  We go about once a month and get a pitcher of Blue Moon and a large sausage pizza. (The pitcher is like 18 bucks so we are considering alternatives.) The servers are always on the ball - they are very relaxed and just do their thing. The pizza is thick - not really deep dish in the purest sense of the word.  The sauce is sweet but not sugary - the sausage is fresh - not pre-cut or prepackaged. The thing is - though - the crust. The crust is crunchy and light and flaky and delicious beyond Yelping. What my people would call a peasant crust - I can't get enough of it.We are going tonight - get our table near the window - and get lost in the best pizza Chicago has to offer...
"4 stars for value alone:1 leines pitcher + 2 side salads + cheesy garlic bread + small pan pizza = $48 with tax and tip.  great deal and a pleasant suprise!we enjoyed the food, beverages, and service before seeing the worlds worst movie, paranormal activity on friday night.  i wish i would have stayed at pequods and thrown myself down those super steep stairs for 1.5 hours rather than see that movie.  lordy.sidenote:  does anyone know what is on the whale's head?  it looks like underpants or a boomerang..."
"The best stuffed pizza in the city, which makes it the best stuffed pizza in the world! Bar none. The sauce is rich yet light but the crust--unreal. It's so good you will easily look past the sports bar TV madness and the din that ensues after about 6:30pm. Small price to pay for pizza bliss."
"Went here recently with friends and we figured out the key to getting a delicious pizza at pequods. If you're a meat lover, go nuts as their toppings are as good as anywhere. If you're a vegan just keep it basic. It seems like when you order more than 2 non meat toppings on a pizza it gets way too soggy because of all the water. We had a sausage, spinach, and garlic pan pizza here and it was excellent. The service is always good even when there busy. And it's clean, spacious, and has big screen tv's so you don't have to miss the game. Overall after being an afterthought when it comes to pizza options, Pequod's is officially in my regular pizza rotation again after a brief hiatus. Good to have you back guys!"
"The most AMAZING crust in the city!  I absolutely LOVE their deep dish pizza.  My husband and I regular order from here, and we have ate in their dining room a few times as well.  We typically get the pan pizza half cheese (for me) and half pepperoni (for him).  I usually insist on the Pequod's salad with house vingarette.  The salad is pretty average, but the pizza is what knocks my socks off.  The crust has this crunchy parmesan taste.  It is SO unique and delicious.  My husband occasionally complains that the pizza doesn't have enough sauce.  However, we never seem to remember to ask for more, so I am not sure what their response would be if you requested it.  I really like the atmosphere when you dine in at Pequod's.  It has a really relaxed almost bar feel.  For me, it's a tie between Lou Malnati's and Pequod's for the best deep dish in Chicago."
"Great place for pizza when you want a change of pace from the typical Chicago-style deep dish. Stick with their pan-style which leaves the best crunchy and crispy crust around the edge. Usually we order the pepperoni and sausage and you can't go wrong.If it wasn't for the very slow service (always slow from when it's packed on weeknights and weekends to even at 3:00p.m. with only 5 other tables occupied), I'd be giving it 5 stars. Sometimes you always have to have an empty glass of beer or soda at this place. Oh well."
"Back in 1991 I went here when I first moved into the hood.  I told my friend, ""great pizza, but they're not gonna make it.""  Twenty-three years later they're still here, having even survived a fire--and still serving the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.   I wish I could just order the burned edges of the crust--delicious.  I always ask for mine well done."
"LOOOOVE me some pequod's !!  Can't believe the first time I dined here I ordered the thin crust!  What was I thinking!?   ""I guess I wasn't.""  :-| Their pan pizza with the caramelized crust is of the most perfect thickness....you can eat it w/ your hands OR a knife and fork. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is always lively.Pequod's offers a decent beer list and boasts a fully stocked bar.I would have Pequod's at least twice a month if it were closer to my house."
"Hello Pequod's.  You are my new close friend.  After a long, cold walk through the city we finally made it to Pequod's for a taste of their famous deep dish pizza.  At 7:00 on a Saturday, we were seated immediately upon arrival, which is surprising since this place was so busy.  We started with a garlic bread appetizer and had a small taste of what was to come with their tasty sauce.  The pizza came out soon afterward and was quite delicious.  The crust was seriously perfect.  So crisp. So tasty.  And the price really wasn't bad at all.  Overall a near perfect evening."
"Pequod's is consistently fantastic pizza--the best deep dish in Chicago.Yes, that caramelized crust is to die for--an almost-sweet and crunchy touch to the savory goodness that lies within its borders. Even better than the crust is the quality of the toppings--hearty and big and just loaded with freshness. I no longer can order pizza with sausage, green pepper and onion at other joints because they cannot compare with Pequod's. The toppings are clearly not from some can or sitting in some fridge for days on end--they are as fresh as if they were just picked.It does get busy, so expect a bit of a wait. Expect to see some hockey on the big screen TVs if there's any being played--the boss here loves it."
"I highly recommend this place for deep dish pizza!  The menu was simple and everything was very fresh.  We ordered the Pequod's salad and a large spinach and fresh garlic deep dish pizza-the perfect size for four people to have two slices each.  It was heaven with the caramelized crust and a nice ratio of cheese/sauce, fresh spinach and sauteed fresh garlic on top.  Heaven!!!  I will be back soon for more!"
"What if you increased the amount of crust boundary by putting a hole in the center, baking in special ring pans? Or maybe you get really fancy and manufacture a spiral aluminum thing, maybe an inch across to fit the pepperoni, and lay the pizza down in that so that literally EVERY bite has that ridiculous caramelized crunch fiesta on TWO edges? Well, physics lesson: too massive a quantity of that kind of awesome all concentrated like that would collapse to form a black hole of tastiness from which ultimately even the world could not escape. Wait, that was supposed to be a downside. Nevermind. Come here and be prepared to love."
"The Best Pan Pizza in Chicago.  Its not ""Chicago"" style - just pan with a really really really crispy crust.  I'll take this over any pizza in Chicago when I'm not craving thin crust.Please - Everyone at least try this one.BTW - I've been told the crust gets a little soggy when you ""carry out"".  You owe it to yourself to sit down and eat one of these pies straight from the pan!"
"Pequod's night staff completely made up for the turd burglar who gave me bad service in the daytime. My friend and I were allowed to sit and eat at the bar when the restaurant was packed. Our pizza was baked in a flash, and the beers were cold and frequently poured. Places like this help restore my faith in Chicago."
"Pan Pizza?  More like deep dish!My wife and I rolled in to Chicago a little late on Friday, and were starving.  Thankfully, my friend had the foresight to order some pizza before we got to his joint.  Pequod's was his choice.  And while one might think you have to get Chicago style pizza in Chicago, this certainly is not a bad option.My friend ordered two pizzas- green peppers and mushrooms on one, and pepperoni and sausage on the other (carnivores gotta eat).  Typically the pizzas take anywhere from 40-50 minutes, so plan ahead people.We got there before the pizza arrived, but it wasn't long before we were rocking some of the best ""non-deep dish"" pizza I've ever had.  The two medium pizzas were enough to feed 7 (though 3 of those people weren't that hungry).  The sausage was pretty stellar, and they really packed on/in the toppings.  It was a great start to my weekend in Chicago.  Oh yeah, Pistons beat the Lakers that evening too, so double in your face!Overall- I would definitely order pizza from here again.Chuck Norris Rating- Head Slam"
"As a native Chicagoan, I never understood the hype about this place until we happened to be walking by and stopped for lunch. And now, all I can say is ... delivery or pickup? So, next time you're wandering by--looking for something to eat before a movie perhaps--give them a try. Green pepper, mushroom and onion, maybe?"
"Makes you forget your hunger, and what you were talking about...Now, choosing a great pizza place in Chicago is like choosing between a gorgeous brunette and a fiery redhead, you marry one and have a shot at a real life, or you gamble and chance landing in a trailer park with 2 kids that aren't yours, living off foodstamps and dance money.  What were we talkin' about?   Pizza, oh yeah.  PIZZA - First, ONLY order the pan pizza.  Thin?  No.  Thin is like, well, like the ugly cousin who just got out of prison.  A Russian prison in Uzbekistan.The pan pizza is perfect.  The seasoned, thick tomato gravy works its way into the thick, yet light crust.  The cheese and sausage (which is nice and chunky and imparting a great flavor to the crust) are a perfect complement.THE CRUST - When you get the pizza, the edge of the crust looks dark, almost burnt, but really, it's CARMELIZED.  Its probably a different cheese from mozzarella, but it's GOOD.  This is one time you want to save the crust for last.  Now, some people don't LIKE carmelized cheese, and that's okay.  You can knock a star off the review in your head, but I keep it at 5.CAVEATS - Parking stinks.  Almost everything else on the menu is just okay, so ONLY order the pan pizza.  Yeah, one trick pony, but this pony can recite Shakespeare while juggling.Order in advance, and order more, cause this is a great next breakfast pizza.  Especially if you chose the trailer park girl and her two kids."
"I've been eating Chicago Style pizza since I cut my first teeth, and Peaquod's became king of the hill in my book last year. After reading the rave reviews on GrubHub.com, my roommate ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. Usually, when either one of us orders pizza, we try and push the leftovers on the other the next day to avoid the guilt of eating pizza two nights in a row. The next day, I feasted on my first slice of microwaved Peaquod's pizza and it tasted better than most slices from  freshly baked pies elsewhere.Peaquod's formula for Chicago Style pizza strays slightly from the standard. Traditional Chicago Style pizza has a moderately thinner pie style crust and is layered with cheese, ingredients, and sauce. Peaquod's is essentially a thick pan pizza with no visible crust - just sauce and cheese straight to the edge. Because the cheese isn't in a hollowed crust, there is slightly less than you'd find on a pizza from Giordano's or Gino's East. As much as I love tons of melted cheese, I'm not bothered by the reduction. What they take away in cheese, they give back in ingredients. Holy freaking pepperoni!Now for the famous ""carmelized cheese crust"" that is mentioned in every review. Personally, it's hardly my favorite thing about Peaquod's but it does have an interestingly good taste. It tastes like a parmesan crisp ...only slightly charred with a bit of pizza sauce on the edge. It's kind of like croutons on a salad in that it's a nice crunchy add on, but overlookable in comparison to the dish it complements.Chicago Style traditionalists may not like Peaquod's because it's not like all the others. I love Chicago Style Pizza and thick crust pan pizza. Finding a place that somehow merged the two was a godsend. I've only had delivery from Peaquod's, but I am anxious to eventually taste a slice fresh out of the oven!"
"So after walking 6 miles to Vanille and seeing that it was closed, I decided that I better leave with something in my stomach. What better than pequods? This is definitely one of my favorite deep dish pizza places, but chicagoans told me I can't call it chicago deep dish. Whatever. It's good and the caramelized cheese crust is delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the proportions of everything was perfect."
"I'll just start off by saying I'm not really a ""pizza person""  I mean, I'll eat it if that's what everyone else wants but it is NEVER my idea to get pizza.That being said, I LOVE Pequod's Pizza!The caramelized cheese crust and the perfect proportions of cheese, sauce, crust and toppings...Pequod's has turned deep-dish pizza into an art!  I always get the sausage and green pepper and am never disappointed!  The house salad is good too!Service can be a little slow but who cares when the pizza is this good.  Here's a tip: call ahead and they will start the pizza for you so it'll arrive at your table shortly after you do!"
"Fantastic Pizza!  Took the whole family and were treated very well.  Even the 4 year old loved the deep dish cheese pizza.  Great servers and fun environment.  Be prepared to wait for a bit for the pizza, but once it gets there you won't be disappointed.  We were looking for a great Chicago style pizza and we found it.  Reasonable prices and easy parking."
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  Pequod's has some seriously good pizza.  My friend's and I stopped in after a movie and had two pan pizzas...one was all veggie and one was all meat.  Since like both, I tried each and they were superb.  I loved the crust.  It was a pan pizza, but the crust wasn't too thick on the bottom or the sides.  The caramelized cheese was yummy!Pequod's is my new favorite pizza joint."
THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO....stop trying all the others...this is it!!!! When we moved to chicago we tried every pizza joint in the area trying to find the mysterious great chicago pizza.  The crust is delectable!! You will not be disappointed! We take all visitors here when they are in town!
I love pizza...and this place doesn't disappoint! (so I'm kinda mad i didn't yelp this ages ago!)Deep dish is great and the crust is amazing. I'm a big crust person...i believe a bad crust can KILL a good pizza. Beer drinkers rejoice! They have good beer specials! on the day i was there  pitchers were around $6 ( if i remember correctly)Its a small space so get there early as they filled up BIG time while i was eating!
"That pizza was delicious! As everyone said, the caramelized cheese crust is crunchy and good and it's my favorite I've had so far. A 10 inch deep dish is the perfect size to split between two people, and I loved that it wasn't greasy and the crust was light instead of doughy. I didn't like that it's $1.50 for each topping. What the heck? Also when ""fresh basil"" is an option as a topping, I'm looking for a layer of basil leaves, not a few scattered slivers that don't even seem like a topping at all. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was relaxed. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but I'd definitely go back when I'm craving some crunchy cheese crust!"
"I'm in love....with their pizza!   Who would think that burnt, crispy cheese crust would be so tasty?!  It certainly is.  Seriously, what is better than pizza and beer?  Yummm!"
"I didn't get a chance to go inside the place, but had my pizza delivered.  It did come within the time they said it would come, which was an hour and 10 minutes.  Let me tell you, it was worth the wait.  This is now my new favorite pizza.  The pepperoni tastes more authentic and the sauce seemed like it gets marinated for hours.  I was trying not to overeat, but it was so hard to pull myself away from another slice.  I had always wished that pizza wouldn't have to have a crust, and it was like Peaquod's read my mind.  It's practically non-existent and then it's like ""Oh my God!""  what is this crispy cheesiness at the end?  This is like having multiple orgasms. Oh yeah, baby.  Yes, yes, yes..."
"Pizza is delicious! I love coming here and they have Peroni on draft, yummm! I try to comein before 8 because it always gets crowded after that. Service is always great, very consistent here! I'm not sure if it's the owner or manager, but he always checks in and asks how everything was. I recommend this place to everyone!"
"You might say I frequent the city of Chicago. Over the past 5 years or so, many people have referred to it as my second home. Co-workers often think I'm from Chicago because I spend so much time there. So naturally, when anyone I know ventures out to my beloved Windy City for the first time, they always ask me ""OK, where do I go to get the best Chicago deep dish pizza?""And until a couple months ago, I greeted them with a blank stare. You see, it had become a joke, we never ate deep dish pizza when I came to town, we were too busy at The Publican or Longman and Eagle, Spiaggia or Avec. But when a friend from Minneapolis met me in Chicago with only 1 request of eating real Chicago pizza? Well we had no choice, we had to break tradition, I mean he did drive like 8 hours just to hang out, right? So off our raucous group went to Pequod's after it was unanimously voted to be the best option and holy crap, were they right! I can't tell you anything you haven't already read but just know it's worth any wait you may have to endure and this really is what they talk about when people praise Chicago deep dish. Praise Pequod's!"
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago.  PERIOD.  The caramelized crust is great.
"The green pepper & onion deep dish from Peaquod's is my favorite deep dish pizza ever.  And I hate veggie pizzas.  Anywhere else I'd be eating plain cheese, or loading it up with meets.  But for some reason, the carmelized crust compliments green peppers and onions perfectly.Also, their logo is a whale with a panty on its head."
"The best pizza I've had in Chicago...yet.Surprisingly inexpensive taboot.  For  $16 plus toppings you can get a large pizza.  At 8 slices, this can feed 4 people.  4 PEOPLE.  I can put away a lot of food for a skinny guy, but I had no desire to eat more after 2 slices.Carmelized crust?  F*cking forgettaboutit.  Too good."
"The sauce needs salt. So there's sauce on the table. The sauce needs a kick. So whaddya know, there's a shaker of chili flakes. The cheese isn't quite savory enough. Hey, lookee here, there's a shaker full of grated 'parm'. If you don't like doctoring your food, you may be disappointed by Pequod's. Me, I'll doctor anything...including you, if you just ask. I liked this pan pizza --not too cheesy, not too saucy. And the dough was good -- wasn't too 'short' (shortening added) - it actually had a great flavor and texture. And the burnt cheese ends at the top of the crust were delicious - like little pizza joint frico. Yeah, the sauce is bland, but at least it isn't bad - and can be fixed."
"Pequod's doesn't deliver to me.  So this is what I do:  I wait 20 minutes for the #74.  I take a 25 minute bus ride.  I walk down Clybourn to Pequods.  I pick up my pizza.  I walk up Clybourn.  I wait 10 minutes for the #74.  I take a 15 minute bus ride back to Logan Square. (Thank god it's faster going west).  I grab a piece of the still warm pizza, and throw the rest in the oven to keep warm.  And then I feast for hours.To do all that, it must be great pizza!"
"Yeah anyway the pizza really is some of the best in Chicago if not America. Duh.One night in here I got into an argument with my friend Eric (the guy who dresses in suits to be ""zany""). We had just started on our pizza when he made a bizarre comment. Read on.Eric: ""You know, Ryan. You remind me of John Travolta when you eat.""Me: ""Oh, thanks. Very nice of you to say that.""Eric: ""I didn't mean that as a compliment.""Me: ""Oh.""Eric: ""It's just...an observation. Like. When you chew, your face, it looks like Travolta's.""Me: ""Fat Travolta or hot Travolta?""Eric: ""Um. Fat Travolta. Sorry.""Me: ""That's cool. I could probably lose a few pounds.""Eric: ""Yeah. We all could.""(awkward silence)Me: ""So.""Eric: ""So.""Me: ""So maybe. I dunno.""Eric: ""What?""Me: ""That's probably the dumbest thing you've ever said in your life.""Eric: ""Just an observation, dude.""Me: ""Oh really? I mean, would you like it if I said, `Eric, when you wipe your hands on your napkin, you look like Mickey Rourke. Not the young and hot Mickey Rourke, but the old and tired Mickey Rourke with the botched facelift and ugly tattoos.""Eric: ""You're overreacting.""Me: ""God. I hate you sometimes.""Then we finished our pizza (excellent) and took a bus to a bar."
"This is my absolute favorite pizza place in the whole world. The crust on the deep dish pizza is to die for. My first experience was as a young, naïve college kid feeling cool in the big city. The atmosphere is very unassuming, but almost makes you feel right at home. Since becoming a city resident, I regularly order delivery and have always been happy with my choice. This weekend, I went in to pick up the pizza and it was packed. The host asked my name, told me where to pick up the pizza and it was in my hands within minutes. Upon leaving, the host thanked me and remembered my name. As if the pizza wasn't already worthy of 5 stars, I'm happy to say that the service is too. I'm sad that it has taken me this long to write a review on one of my favorite Chicago establishments, but I guess I am better late than never. Eat here now!!!"
"Just go to Pequods.  I don't know why burnt cheese is good, but it is."
"Hands down the best pizza in chicago. I will fist fight you to defend their honor! You can eat at all the famous tourist traps all you want but Pequods has everything and more.The reputation of this pizza joint was heard about even before I moved from Michigan to Chicago. Its not a chain its just damn good plain and simple. The pan pizza, I cannot give enough justice to it in written words. You simply must try it.. The dough, sauce, cheese all comes together to form greatness! The Best part is the caramelized cheese on the sides! Go forth and try it!"
"This is my favorite pizza spot!!!!  When I want to sit down and eat pizza - this is the only place I can think of.  It is REAL chicago deep dish!!  On me and my boyfriend's two year anniversary, we decided to do something simple yet satisfying - order a deep dish pizza with everything we've ever wanted on it (which equals like a +$25 pizza because of the toppings so yeah it's a special occasion-type-dinner).  So we got extra sauce, extra cheese, garlic, basil, tomatoes, and i think we also had sausage (not sure).  It was still delicious but we won't get extra sauce and cheese ever again - very messy on deep dish.  We'll stick with our usual garlic, basil and tomato deep dish though.  If only they had ricotta cheese as an additional topping option it would be - perfecto! Th wait staff is very nice and I have no complaints about the atmosphere.This is a place for people who want REAL pizza.  No joke."
"I'm a huge fan of their deep dish pizza, especially the crust.  I love their Italian sausage and pepperoni pizza, and they are generous with their toppings.  I usually order extra sauce because it can be a bit dry for me.  I've had an instance in the past where we received a totally different pizza than we ordered.  After calling them up, they extended us a refund for $15 on the next pizza order- without having to return the pizza.  Good service and delivery can be quick!Reason for 4 stars?  Their pizza isn't always very consistent (I swear the crust changes every time) and their prices are quite high.  Hey, it can't be that bad...I keep coming back for more!"
"Possibly my favorite deep dish in the city. Dat carmelized crust, tho! Get the ground beef and pepp. It's the perfect meaty concoction on a cold evening before heading to a movie across the street. Very friendly, attentive service even on a Saturday."
"OK I get it now. I am a convert.  I have seen the light.  Thus, I must go back and refine my relatively negative review to a ""hell yes"".Their thin crust is pretty weak, and I stand by that. But I finally had the pan.  O lord the pan...WHOLE different ballgame.  Lots of nice tangy sauce, good crust, but the real kicker is that carmelized crust.  WHOO!  Granted I had the pan in the Morton Grove location, but I assume it is the same here.  It completely kicked me where I wanted to be kicked.  Plus they have Fat Tire on tap, which always brightens my day just a little.  See Pequod?  It took me awhile but I came around to your charms."
"That whale sure does makes good pizza. This is the best pizza I have EVER eaten... and I have had a lot of pizza. The carmelized cheese rocks, the best part of the whole pizza. I have never experienced a more unique pizza than with the straight-up pepperoni pan pizza.I would give them 10-million stars, but that ain't possible so I guess Five Stars will do. The best part of the whole deal is that they have a bar in there... and yes! You guessed it! They serve some crazy bourbon drinks! So come one come all!Yeah, definitely forget Pizzeria Uno, Due, Giordano's, Lou Malnotti's and those other places... go here!!! Now!!!!!"
"Best...pizza...ever.I could not possibly say enough good things about Pequod's pizza. I'm don't care that it takes a long time to get your pizza, that its pricy, and that the old decor was much better. The pizza is insanely good. Get it pan, get pepperoni and onions on it. Eat your self sick."

"Great pizza and the wait staff was very courteous. We went to dinner at 6 on a Saturday and there was no wait. Around 6:30 the place started getting really packed so we got there at a great time. Our only complaint is that we were at a middle high-top table and when it got packed people surrounded around the bar which was right next to our table. Other than that, I highly recommend it."
Great deep dish. Better than other chained stores.
"i am giving it 4 stars because normally this is 5 star pizza but the last time I was in, admittedly it was the most packed it has ever been while i was there, was average at best. I have had many good experiences there before, with their perfect crust, great sauce and generous tasty toppings. Not sure what happened when i was there last but I guess even the best have an off night."
"Holy deliciousness batman! This pizza is mighty tasty and mighty filling.I have eaten it in or to go and all times it has been amazing. It is the best pizza around, especially the pepperoni. Plus their logo is a freakin' sweet whale with a thong on its head."
"My friends and I visited Chicago from Austin last weekend.  We chose Pequod's Pizzeria based on a local's enthusiastic recommendation.  True to his assesment, the food was absolutely amazing, though one of my friends is a vegan and ordered a salad; her salad came toppped with pepparoni...something the menu didn't mention.The short, skinny waitress that waited on us didn't seem interested in sticking around to help our table, even though the place was not too busy for a Satuday lunch crowd.Overall, I would definitely recommend Pequad's to anyone,  and would love to go back next time I'm in Chicago."
"Went to Pequod's last week and ordered their thin crust for the first time.The pan pizza is much better, but we wanted to give their thin crust a try.  Definitely stick with the pan.  The pizza is pretty expensive, but good.  We go for the atmosphere and love their 2 people booths.  We also ordered the zucchini sticks as an appetizer, and that was a rip-off.  I agree with Frankie J., just only order the pan pizza.Their pan pizza takes a while (30-35 minutes), so if you're hungry, pre-order your pizza over the phone, and  it'll be ready for your when you sit down!"
"This is a Chicago Deep Dish lovers heaven. This is my favorite place to take friends from out of town because it's so unique and delicious! Nothing can beat Pequod's charred crust with the overflowing layer of toasted cheese.  If you're one to save your carbs for only worthwhile foods, this is the place to eat your heart out!"
Best pizza in Chicago! Love the burnt crust on the deep dish. Yummo!
"I was always a pan girl until I tried Pequod's. They totally converted me to thin crust! Well for the most part, i do LOVE my stuffed pizza!I've had their thin crust pepperoni and thin crust spinach. Both were amazing! Generous with the pepperoni and cheese so there's no complaints here!For people who like onion rings, they're HUGE here! This is the only place where I'll actually eat Jalapeno poppers. Their cheese bread is great too!I lovepractically everything about this place.Only downside is that service can be slow and the pizza is good but a little greasy if that's something you care about. With pizza this good, I don't!! Just blot! ;)"
"I only order Pequod's deep-dish. It has a carmelized crust which required some getting used to, but now invokes some looking forward to.My story about Pequod's:We got completely drunk one night, had a couple people over and things got a bit chaotic. My roommates ordered a large deep-dish. During the time it took for the pizza to arrive, half the party left and the other half fell asleep (or passed out, if you will.) The pizza came, no one answered the door and the delivery guy left. We order regularly and immediately became worried about the next time we wanted some deep-dish. It's the only place we order from so thoughts raced through our minds. Will they spit in it next time? Will they put us on a black-list, a la Elaine at the chinese restaurant?Leaving nothing to chance, I ordered and had them deliver to the apartment building across the street.  It took an hour of staring out the window and some serious self-reflection time, but it arrived as planned.It's that good."
"BEST DEEP DISH Pizza in the whole world.... why stop @ Chicago...?I get the same toppings(mushrooms, onion and pepper) jus coz I don't think it can get better than that. I am also afraid, if it did get better, then I will become a Pequod junkie. They have a cool lunch special, personal pizza and a beverage (includes beer) for $5.99 which if you can get ur ass out during lunch hours, is totally worth the hike. We have actually taken the metra to the Clyborn station and walked 4 blocks to eat there. It's that good! Try it and u will be a believer too. :)"
"I'm a pizza fiend. I wouldn't call myself a snob because I'll pretty much eat any kind of pizza and release an earth-shattering belch afterward to let you, everyone in the room and everyone in a 5 block radius how good that shit was. With that said, Pequod's is one of my top 3 favorite pizza places in this city. Walking up to it, the aroma of hot salami fills your nasal cavities which makes you pray to god there's not a wait (I've only ever encountered a wait a few times). I prefer to sit upstairs in a booth, but I did get to sit at one of those tall tables in the window last week which felt pretty baller.Get the pepperoni. I don't care if you're a vegetarian or anti-peps. Give up your silly rules for one night and do yourself a life-changing favor. Indulge in some delicious red meat and burnt cheese crust. Let the hot sloppy cheese burn the inside of your mouth so bad that when you go to the dentist the next day, he asks you if you had recently eaten pizza. So, when you admit it, he can show you on that mouth cam what kind of damage it did to the inside of your mouth. WORTH IT.I take all of my out of town guests here. It's within walking distance of my apartment (dangerous) and they advertise their lunch special like whoa ($5 for a personal peetz and beer, who wants to ditch work one day and take advantage of that gem?)"
"I pass by this place about every week, but just stopped in for the first time a few days ago (maybe I was still bitter from analyzing ""If man will strike, strike through the mask"" and other MD quotes as a high schooler). Now I wish that I would have gone here sooner! They don't skimp with the toppings, and I was a bit skeptical about the crust at first, but it was really good! The garlic bread was pretty good, as well. Definitely worth trying, if you haven't already!"
Let's put it this way:  I love Lou Malnati's.  I haven't been to Lou's since I found Pequod's.
I absolutely LOVE the pizza here. LOVE - that's saying something from a native Chicagoan. (Don't skip the crust - its so good!!!)
Who would have known that next to the Thai place there was this gem that I have been seeing so often is soo good!! We had a slice of pizza(thin crust) with spinach.. it was so tasty! the cheese melts in your mouth.. and it has a great texture. The service was great also.This place is def. worth it!! will be back
Great pizza and local Chicago experience. But could a girl ask for some better maintained bathrooms?  How many times do I have to sit/stand in urine.
"Well Pequod's is coming to my house, my house. I'll eat all the crust, kid, eat all the crust.I've got a couch and a ""salad"" at my house, my house.I'll eat all the crust, kid, eat all the crust.I've got one fat kitty at my house, my house.He's ripped all the furniture to shreads. Well, Pequod's coming to my house, my houseYou've got to eat it up kid, eat it upWell Pequod's is coming to my  house, my houseI've waited 1 hour and 15 mins.There's girl in every room, at my house my house.And the neighbors think we're nice and politeThere's a pot of tea brewin' at my house, my houseBecause the Tetley's blend tastes real nice.(cowbell) youtube.com/watch?v=o-7D…"
"The pizza is good, the caramelized cheese makes it great.  It's not your typical Chicago deep dish pizza -the crust isn't dry and boring like at most of the Chicago pizza places.  The lunch special is a steal.  $5 for a personal pizza with 1 topping and 1 drink (includes beer on tap).I liked the old dining area before the renovations but there is more seating now, so I guess it's a push.  They used to show a music station on the flat tube that basically only showed videos or concert/live performance footage.  It wasn't on today.It's really easy for a dinner and movie date since the movie theater at Webster place is right across the street.5 stars for the pizza and I'd give it an extra star for Pequod's mascot - a whale wearing what appears to be a thong on its face.  If someone can explain that to me, it would be greatly appreciated."
"In college, I would go to a place called Papa Del's (in Champaign) for amazing deep dish pizza.  They served quality ingredients (especially the sauce....oooooh the sauce) and it was always worth the wait.  I lived in Chicago one summer and tried a bunch of deep dish pizzas (Pizzeria Due, Giordano's, Lou Milnati's, etc), but didn't like ANY of them.   Eating at all of those places seriously made me long for Papa Del's.Well, I'm out of college and I moved to New York, but whenever I visit Chicago, my friend, Brian, stuffs me with all kinds of Chicago-style food.  One place he introduced me to, Pequods, reminds me of Papa Del's, and, dare I say it, might be BETTER than Papa Del's!  They have a deep dish pizza that has a caramelized crust (they put parmesan around the crust before putting it in the oven).  The pizza has just the right amount of everything; it's not just a thin crust pizza with an inch of gloppy cheese (like SOME Chicago pizzerias).  I asked about shipping pizzas from Pequods to New York, but it was too expensive (dry ice, overnight shipping, etc)  I suppose I'll fly to Chicago anytime I have a craving :)"
"I ordered delivery from here, and I liked it, but it was lacking somehow, and I hated their garlic bread (a sesame seed hoagie cut and toasted with garlic butter).  However, a significant number of friends whose opinions I value said I had to try this place.  After reporting back to one, he told me I need to eat on-site.  So, I went over and had dinner there with a friend.  The advice was pretty spot on.  Somehow, being here made it so much better.  I don't know what happened the first time between Pequod's and my door, but when I ate the pizza at Pequod's, I was able to appreciate it so much more.  The caramelized crust is amazing, the ingredients are pretty fresh, and the atmosphere was much nicer than I'd imagined it would be from the outside.  It looks like a sports bar, and it kind of is, but I didn't feel like I was sitting in a sports bar from my booth, and there were lots of families around.  So, I highly recommend Pequod's for your deep dish, but you gotta go there.  don't get it delivered or to-go."
"I have only seen my father get emotional maybe twice: once for my uncle getting married and another time when we saw Stonehenge. Until we went to Pequods. I don't know, maybe its the fact I grew up in the southeast and the only pizza we had was dominoes but that all changed when I moved to Chicago. Now, I have access to some of the best pizza places around: Art of Pizza, Pequod's, Pat's, and even some of the chains are way better than the cardboard I was used to eating. Anyway, my father and I got a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and fresh basil.  I mean holy shit, this stuff was great, and my dad would not shut up about it. I had to take him to see a movie to shut him up.  Even after There Will Be Blood he was going on a on about the pizza.  So there you have it Pequods, you managed to out due an Oscar winning performance with your pizza.  Good Job."
"Yelp reviews turned me on to this place and by golly, this place is the real deal for Chicago deep dish. I love pizza and there are many different styles of pizza: NY Pizza, Chicago deep dish, Sicilian style Sfinguni (not sure about spelling), and they are all good. But, for all those places out there that claim to have Chicago style deep dish pizza, come here and be humbled. Is there better out there? Maybe, but I have yet to find it. I am sure if I go to more places in the Windy City I'll find other places that compare but Chicago is a BIG city! In the mean time, I will continue to stop here whenever I visit Chicago until they disappoint me, twice (I always figure everyone has one bad day)."
"Deep dish is the shit, best id ever had. i live in California and im pissed that we dont have deep dish of this caliber there."
"My desert island pizza, if that's even a thing. I definitely miss the smoke-filled, non-biance from the pre-fire, pre-re-remodel days, but the pizza's still delicious and worth suffering through Lincoln Park for. Five stars for the pizza, minus one for not delivering to Logan Square. C'mon guys, get it together. We're dying out here!"
"My family loves Pequod's.  It is one of their favorite pizza companies of all times. I have been on the fence for awhile because I was not sure if I really did enjoy their caramelized signature crust. I used to think it was too burnt for my liking.Yesterday, on a Saturday, I ordered a small pan pizza with garlic and spinach for take out. Service: The place was packed, but when I made my way to the order desk, they had several people on hand to assist.Serving size: My roommate and I shared the small pan pizza and it was the right am amount of food without overeating and we were pretty hungry to begin with.This pizza smelled amazing. I was tempted on the ride home to take a bite, but I resisted.When I took a bite at home, I was speechless. The caramelized crust is ingenious and really gives the pizza a delicious and unique taste. They are now in my top 3 favorite pizza places of all times. If you have not tried it, do it."
The pizza is amazing. I love it so much I paid an extra $20 to have them deliver it out of their delivery zone once...it's that good!
"Sweet Jesus, this pizza is even better as leftovers.  The burnt cheese is unreal.  Our original order was on Monday, I enjoyed some of it Tuesday (at home in CA) and on Friday and both were FANTASTIC!"
Gotta love the caramelized crust!
"First let me get this off my chest: I don't like deep dish pizza.  I think it's gross and heavy.I also don't like most paper-like crispy thin crust.  Sorry, I just don't.However, the thin crust is really the best in the city.   It's not so thin that it snaps in half, it's probably more like a thin hand toss.  I have lived here a while now and haven't found my pizza stride till Pequod's. We have eaten (ate?) there - the place was packed and we had to wait a while for a table - I think that's normal for good food in the area.  We had a basic italian salad with dinner and it was OK, thankfully the pizza was less mediocre.We have also had take out several times.  Searching on the internet, we could find no coupons.  Sad, because that's really the best way to order take out food."
Wow this probably one my biggest disappointments as far as eating. I walked 3 miles here to draw up my appetite because usually my eyes are bigger than my stomach. One slice and I tapped out. I couldn't believe it. The pie itself was amazing. I had sausage and spinach. This was really my first time eating deep dish. I definitely have to visit again when I come back to Chicago.
"I am from Houston, TX and I have never had a deep dish pizza. I'm not even that crazy about pizza. However, after eating here I would plan another trip just to eat here again.  Amazing.  Just a plethora of cheeses and spices dancing on my palate.  I LOVED IT."
"Yummy...I came in one late night for a slice and couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about.  But today I brought a friend here and we ordered an entire pan pizza.  That's the only way the carmelized crust comes and it's the only way you should order your pizza here.This crust is fabulous.  We got ground beef  and mushroom on one half, pepperoni and green pepper on the other.  Skip the ground beef and order pepperoni.  They put the ingredients on top of the sauce and cheese and for me, this is an Absolute MUST!  It keeps the ingredients from getting wet and soggy.  I don't know who decided to do it the other way but pizza is not pizza with wet meat under the cheese.  The service here is fabulous.  They get you served up fast and check back on you.  You know, the way it's supposed to be done.You cannot miss the bathrooms.  They are pointed out by a neon sign larger than the beer signs.  I like that.  I wonder, though, how many people still ask where the bathrooms are.  Nothing special inside.  Reminded me of my dorm bathrooms."
"Best pizza in Chicago, hand's down. Great managing of a Chicago classic. This place gets busy because it's just that good and fun place to hang out with friends or bring the family before a movie."
the wait was ridiculous.the pizza is so fluffy!the water tastes disgustingthe soda wasn't that sweettwo slices filled me up very welli would go there again!oh leftovers tasted better.
Pequod's.....why did it take me soooo long to find you??  Our first date was slightly off when I was told it was the best pizza out there only to be taken by a friend to get the thin crust pizza?!  That was then and this is now when I stumbled back in and experienced the REAL deal DEEP dish pizza.  Yum....yum!!  Can you say carmellized crust.....that's right the crust is consistently and deliciously always carmelized in Pequod's fashion.  This is a tough choice as there are many options in the area but my crown goes to Pequod's for the best deep dish za' in all of Chicago.  Go for the pizza and stay for the beers!
"We spent almost an hour trying to get to this place due to transportation issues, but it was worth it. Thank goodness these guys serve food until 2 a.m. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere; dimly lit with a neon glow against deep red bricks. Our server had a bit of an attitude, because we asked her to repeat the beer on tap, but she came around toward the end of our meal. The cheesy bread wasn't anything special, but still hit the spot. The pizza was exceptional. The buttery crust was crispy and soft and added more richness to the toppings. They pile on the pepperoni and don't skimp on fresh garlic. And they have a good selection of cold beer to wash down your piping hot pie."
"First of all, I went in there STARVING. There was absolutely nowhere to sit or even stand really. I think the place was just packed and people were willing to wait it out, and after I had the pizza I knew why. It was outstanding. I don't usually like deep dish because the crust can be disgusting on the inside, but this deep dish was perfectly cooked all the way through. The thin crust was just as good.I have seen people complain about the appetizers, but how can you bitch about fried vegetables and ranch dressing? Even the garlic cheese bread was awesome. 8 of us shared three pies, two app. platters, two orders of bread, and at least 4 pitchers of beer. The total with tax came out to around $18 a person. AMAZING PRICE. The service was great, once we were seated after a 45 minute wait- brilliantly the staff suggests ordering your pizza while you wait so that it will be ready when you get your table. I am already planning when to return."
"Obviously the pan pizza is the way to go at this pizza place.  The caramelized crust is just superb.  Get ready for some large toppings, because they come in chunks!  Yum, I just ordered it and I can't wait for it to be delivered!"
Ate here on the Chicago Pizza Tours and it was my favorite. Had never been a fan of chicago style deep dish with the sauce on the top until I had it here.
I went here yesterday and I LOVED the pizza!!!! Whats not to love from their thin pizza! I had pepperoni and mushroom!WOw  oh man was this thing good. It had the pizza covered in Pepperoni!I was born and raised here in Chicago and have had my share of pie's. This is in my top 5.Service was good and everyone was nice. There was a old guy with beard and long hair. He was thanking everyone as they left the door. nice guy. Hasta pronto!
"This is simply the best pizza anywhere.Their pan pizza really defies classification--to call it ""Chicago Style"" pizza does it a disservice:  It is no three-inch thick slab of overwhelming cheesyness topped with an anemic tomato paste.  No.  It is a superb bread to cheese to sauce ratio.  And there has been though put into how everything tastes.  The bread compliments the cheese taste which compliments the well-spiced sauce.  Many people have mentioned the caramelized crust, and it's just about perfect.I'm honestly less enamored with the thin crust pizza, but I'm not sure why anyone would come to Pequod's and get the thin crust pizza...  I feel the same way about the appetizers, but, again, if you're ruining your appetite for pizza on the appetizers that's, like, your choice, man.There is a pretty decent beer selection, and the service is fine.  Pequod's is very busy on weekend nights, so expect to wait a little while if you don't have a reservation."
Pequods has the best regular/deep dish pizza in Chicago.  The crust is amazing!
"Excellent pizza. I do like their deep dish. Good sauce, not too cheesy. One of the few pizza places where I have cravings for the pizza. I usually get a cheese pizza, or with spinach on it, easy on the cheese. Atmosphere is nothing too special... The table placement is a bit tight, unless you are at one of the tall tables in the front. Beer selection is ok, service is good."
"Stopped by this pizza joint on our way to the movies. I'd love to give it 5 stars because the food is so great but I'm giving 4 stars because uncomfortable temp. Best deep dish pizza I've had...but man, the other day we were in there and I was dying of a heat stroke! The weather outside was humid and about 90 degrees, inside - was almost the same. The AC of this establishment just couldn't keep up . We honestly were fanning ourselves with the menus because it was unbearable to sit and just sweat in the booth. Outside of the temperature in the restaurant, the food is fresh, hot and delicious. They are so generous with their portions of each ingredient, love that as my bf and I never can agree on the same ingredients on one pizza. I loved how friendly and accomodating the staff was. As we were about to leave to catch our movie, it started pouring rain, we were waiting inside for about 10 minutes, contemplating to run in the crazy rain to the theatre or to miss the previews...as one of the employees came up to us and gave us an umbrella that has been sitting in their lost and found for months. MADE MY DAY! Thank you so much!!!"
"Wow!  Talk about a delicious yummy pizza!  A friend was telling me about this place, we were deciding where to order pizza from.  So he suggested Pequod's.  This was not a disappointment.  The crust is amazing, it is almost like a caramelized crust the way it is baked.  Perfect combination of delicious sauce and cheese.  One of the best pizza's I have had in a long time!  I'm a fan!"
"This is one of my favorite places to eat pizza.  You'll be shocked how good a burnt crust tastes.  We order the double pepperoni, deep disk.   I would stay away from too many vegetables at this place.  They fight the essence of the pizza.If you love pizza and have tried lots of different pizza Pequod's will be a nice treat for you. I love the name too."
"Not your run-of-the-mill deep-dish experience. With it's extremely flavorful and high quality ingredients (the sauce and toppings were fantastic), and lighter, less cheese-dominated pizza, Pequod's is definitely among the best deep-dish/pan pizza's I've every had.We ordered our pizza to-go, so I can't speak for the restaurant experience Pequod's offers, but the food was delicious. We ordered both the thin crust (which was more like a regular pie than typical crispy thin crust), as well as the standard pan pizza. While both were good, the pan/deep-dish pie is what really impressed me. I don't exactly recall the toppings we ordered for the thin crust (the pan pizza was THAT good), but we ordered the pan pie with spinach, onion, basil, and garlic, which ended up being an excellent combination.Unlike some of the Chicago deep-dish staples (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, etc.), Pequod's pan pizza was fairly light on the cheese, which I felt allowed me to better appreciate the other components of the pizza (sauce, toppings, etc.). This also meant I was able to eat more, as the pizza was more bready and not nearly as heavy as that of some of Pequod's competitors.The ingredients seemed very fresh and flavorful, and the caramelized crust was a pleasant change from traditional deep dish as it was enjoyable on its own and also pretty light.The only downside about this place was the price of the pizza. After including the toppings, a medium thin crust and a large pan totaled to about $40. At the end of the day, though, the pizza was probably satisfying enough to justify the extra cost, and ended up being more than enough for four people.I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a slightly unique take on Chicago's deep-dish, and especially those looking for a lighter pizza that isn't as cheese-heavy as some of the other traditional deep-dish establishments."
"You know, I was skeptical about this caramelized cheese around the crust I kept hearing about, but I took my friend's advice and checked out Pequod's.  I have to say, I was totally impressed.All the tourist oriented pizza places I've ended up in Chicago.  Long lines, substandard food and high prices have been pretty depressing to me.  Pequod's had no wait, huge hdtvs everywhere and really goos pizza.  And the quality of their toppings was good too.Highly Recommended"
"Pequod's has definitely become one of my favorite deep dish places in town.  I hear people complain about the thin crust, which I've never tried because the deep dish is so good.  The beer selection was ok, but I'm getting tired of Fat Tire, 312, and Anchor being the only Miller/Bud/Coors alternative in town.The place can be packed at times, but usually the wait isn't long - especially with the upstairs area.  The staff is always friendly and even lets you order a deep dish pizza if you are waiting.Parking though - is a pain.  A big one.  I guess that goes for most places in the neighborhood."
"Best pan pizza in Chicago, hands down."
"I can't say anything that hasn't been said a million times on Yelp about Pequod's already.  Quite honestly, my favorite pan pizza in Chicago.  The crust is perfectly thick.  The sausage is my FAVORITE.  I'm quite leary about italian sausage in Chicago.  The ""layer of sausage"" at a certain pizza joint favored by concierge's all over the city that will remain nameless made me violently ill once.  Since then I am extremely picky about the sausage.Pequod's sausage is perfect.  Perfect seasoning with a slight twinge of fennel along with perfectly sized chunks.I always ask for my pie well done.  This makes the generous layer of pepperoni on top a little bit crispy.And I won't even talk about he carmelized cheese.  Its my favorite part.Pequods for life!"
"(Morton Grove location:) Seems like a typical pizza dive joint - perfect for when you don't care what you look like and want to eat out.  I actually felt like I was back in a pub in my hometown in BFE.  The whale motif was actually kind of cool (different), even though I didn't get the Moby Dick reference until I looked it up on Wikipedia afterwards. We ordered garlic bread, which was crunchy enough to my liking, followed by a small pan pizza (I know other reviews mention deep dish, but this reminded me more of the Pizza Hut pan pizza).  The menu said the dark edges of the crust were the caramelized cheese, which sounds fantastic, but ours must have come out too burnt.  It was so black that it lost that wonderful 'burnt cheese' taste that I like.  But the black crust was my only complaint.  The sauce was rich, and there was a perfect amount of dough, cheese, and sauce.  The dough was a bit crunchy, just how I like it. I was pleasantly stuffed with a small pan pizza split between two people.  Definitely worth the stop if you lika-the-pizza.Edit: This place gets better every time I visit - I'm definitely now sold that this is some of the best deep dish on the planet (at least when your pizza comes out perfectly caramelized)!"
"When my friend the lacto said it was worth her, um, ""symptoms"" to eat here, it only confirmed what I already knew.  Pequod's is the best pizza in chicago!  I haven't been to the redone location (after the fire) and my 5-star rating is based on the pizza alone.  My favorite includes olives, mushrooms and spinach, and lots of sauce.  The caramelized crust is incredible.  Go here.  Lactose intolerance is no excuse!"
"Best Pan pizza in Chicago, better than Lou Malnati's.Right amount of tomato sauce and cheese, amazing dough - caramelized crust is amazing."
"I love Pequod's!! I'm not normally a fan of ""Chicago style"" deep dish, but Pequod's deep dish is in a league of it's own. Their weekday lunch specials are also amazing if you're in the area."
"I LOVE Pequod's. Seriously, pretty much every other pizza place in the city can suck it. I live down the block from Lou Malnati's and go out of my way to avoid it. I desperately miss working on Clybourn and being able to hop in to Pequod's for their lunch special- $4.95 for a personal pan pizza and a beer is a steal. Can't get enough of the carmelized crust!"
"Seriously good pizza.  Burnt, caramelized crust.Tomato sauce on top.If Rachel Ray ate there she'd say it was ""yum-o"".Definitely worth a trip.The one thing they're lacking is an outdoor patio."
"Pequod's pizza is right up there as one of my favorite pizzas. The sauce is sweet, but not overly sweet and there's the right amount of cheese. Not too much... not too little. For some strange reason I am not a fan of pizza w/ a crapload of cheese. I like my pizza slightly well done and the price isn't too bad. Dammit.. now I want pizza. Only 4 stars due to lack of parking... street parking sucks."
"I found this spot shortly after I moved to the city and I love it!  #1 Reason I gave Pequod's 5 stars instead of 4:  Great pizza isn't hard to find in Chicago but it's the atmosphere at Pequod's that keeps me coming back.  The interior is a laid-back pub/dive bar and the music is a mix of 80s & 90s rock (like many restaurants) BUT Pequod's takes it a step further and plays the corresponding music videos on the tvs throughout the restaurant!  It's hilarious and wildly entertaining and reason enough for me to keep coming here rather than somewhere else. Haha, now that aside, on to the food:  Contrary to what one other reviewer had said I think the sauce is EXCELLENT and flavorful and you can smell it from outside the restaurant.  I suppose it is all a matter of personal opinion but I love that their pizza is more of a cross between deep-dish and pan which leaves room for more sauce, toppings and cheese than the usual 2"" thick deep-dish crust .  I might also add that the Pequod's salad is very delicious if you're looking for somewhat lighter fare.  My parents demand we go to Pequod's every time they visit now!"
"This is the most unique, best pizza in the city hands down.  You know, we all have those nights when we are hungry, drunk, or bored, and think, why not put a frozen pizza in the oven, and let the crust burn, and eat it.Now you dont have to do that, just order Peaquods.  Somehow this burnt crust makes the pizza amazing, and the rest aint bad either.  We usually order food, but with the upstairs redone, it is not a bad place to eat and watch some games."
Best pizzas in Chicago in my opinion.  Get the deep dish.  No crust.  Cheese goes all the way top the pan.  It is to die for.
"To me, this place is unique amongst the Chicago style pizza places.  The burnt ring around the edge of the pizza really adds something different, and somehow it actually works.I've only been here for lunch.  They run a great deal at $5 for a personal size pizza and a drink.  You can even get a beer if you wish for that price.The veggie toppings I've tried have always been fresh, and I've never had a bad pizza here.  I wish it was a little closer to the ""el"" but it's worth the walk or short cab ride from the North Clybourn stop."
"Truly excellent pizza.The deep dish IS really bready, I admit, but it tastes so good I'll forgive them.  If someone could invent a deepdish pie that is right between Giordano's cheese soup and Pequod's bready loaf, I would be in heaven.The carmelized cheese crust is a delight, but the kicker is the toppings.  Outrageously good sausage, big honkin' slices of peppers, nothing canned or stingy about this pie.  Mmmmm.We also ordered the mostacholi with meat sauce - the noodles were a little soggy (probably because it was delivered and had to sit a little while) but was still very very tasty."
The pizza here is fantastic. Here's why:-The toppings are great-The crust has an awesome buttery crispness on the bottom-The caramelized cheese around the edges is out-of-this-worldJust go here now. Do it. You won't be disappointed.
I forgot I had negatively reviewed Pequods in the past. Their delivery continues to be horrible but eating at the restaurant is amazing. Their pizza is one of the best in the city. Both the deep dish and the thin crust are so good (although I dont love the burnt cheese edges like everyone else does). So good. Love eating at Pequods. Worth the wait.
"By far the best pizza that is not Malnati's or Uno, for obvious reasons. The pure idea that pequods has awesome, amazing pizza with huge chunks of meat and vegetables and cheese that oozes out says tons. AND they are open till 2 am everyday of the week, which means when you get off work and are starving or you get out of the bar and are starving, you can call hand have them deliver to you!!It may take an hour for the delivery but its well worth it.Their carmelized deep dish crust is absolutely to die for.Definetly cell phone worthy"
"I've been eating Pequod's for years now, and it is still my favorite deep dish pizza.  As others have said, the caramelized crust is so so delicious.  I love everything about the pizza--the crust, the cheese, the sauce, etc.  I usually order cheese and mushroom, and it never fails.  I must worn you, though, it takes a while for delivery (as does any deep dish pie delivery), and the bottom of the crust can get somewhat soggy after the travel.  I recommend going in to eat.  The inside is nice since the post-fire remodeling a couple of years ago.One last thing...try the fried zucchini.  It's homemade, and dipping it into their ranch dressing sends me into euphoria."
"As a New Yorker, I am obviously biased (or just a better judge?) but for what I consider more ""pie"" than ""pizza"", the carmelized crust does taste pretty damn good. The sauce is also better than at other places. The rest if par for Chicago's overcompensation of cheese (use what you got, right?) and day-old-tasting crust. Let the NY-bashing begin!Seriously, though, PM me if you're ever on your way to Brookly, and I'll give you 4 places that DEFINE pizza!"
"Love this pizza!! Best pizza in LP, no doubt! I love and can eat pizza all day but this place, I always set my limit when I eat here because it's the only pizza I can't finish! The wait and service is average at best but the pizza itself makes up for it. The other food isn't good really, don't even recommend the dessert but the pizza is one of the best in Chicago. DEPP DISH!!!"
"Let me start off by saying I consider my self a pizza guy. Before I ate at Pequod's, I considered Lou's as the best Chicago style pizza in town. While I still love Lou's, I will move that title to Pequod's! This place is amazing!. My buddy Rich introduced me to this gem one night and the rest is history. I haven't eaten deep dish pie anywhere else since. After I had it the first time, I had cheese, I thought wow this pizza is great. The second time I had their sausage and green pepper, even better. Since then, I have ordered it several times and it has been just as good every time. Even their delivery is excellent. The pie comes to my house steaming hot and I live in the loop, which is a fair distance from the Lincoln Park location. Anyway I can go on, but let me just say it is the BEST pizza anywhere!! Try this place, you will feel the same way. Enjoy!"
Best Pizza in town. Period.Their caramelized crust is brilliant.
"I am a huge pizza whore and decided to have my son's first birthday party at Pequod's! I love their pizza (especially the deep!!! It is the rare deep, but not stuffed kind!) and knew they had a nice sized party room.  At first I was feeling a little guilty that maybe it was a selfish decision, but after having a successful birthday bash there, all guilt was gone.  The pizza, service and value were all great!!  Maybe parties at Pequod's will be a new birthday tradition?"
"Wow, AWESOME.This place catapulted to the top of my ""favorite pizza in Chicago, and consequently, the world"" list with my inaugural visit there last weekend.  Sauce is great.  Crust is great.  Toppings are great.  Setting is great (Painting of GANDALF in the bathroom?!  Saying ""You Shall Not Piss!""?  Awesome!).I cannot say anything else that hasn't been said about it.  Just go.  Take the bus, take your car, take a taxi... it's worth it!"
"Came straight here from the airport.  Sausage and pepperoni deep dish pie.  Perfect, caramelized crust, owing, no doubt, to the generations old cat iron pans.  Best tomato sauce I have ever had on a pizza - not to sweet, not too tart, not to thick - just right.  Tasted like tomatoes.  Skip the chains and come here."
"Some people just don't like caramelized cheese. I've been to Pequod's more than just a couple times, and I have to say, I'm a fan of the caramelized cheese concept. SOMETIMES I've had them burn the cheese, but in general, ""caramelized"" doesn't mean ""burnt.""The toppings, sauce, and cheese are very good. This pizza isn't really good the next day, though... Eat what you order before it gets cold. Surprisingly, though... I don't really see Pequod's Pizza as the type of food I can eat a lot of. I mean, I can eat a lot of Edwardo's, or any other regular-style pizza... But eventually, eating Pequod's Pizza just makes my mouth hurt.I love the idea that they're a bar/restaurant that's open until 2AM WITHOUT CLOSING THE KITCHEN. It really upsets me when you can't get a burger (or pizza) around closing time to save your life. Sometimes you need a little food to absorb all that drink.Pequod's has a cult-like following. If you can look past the charring on the caramelized cheese, you'll get sucked in too."
"One of THE best pizza in the city of Chicago, specifically the pan pizza, as the thin crust is just average.  I also like Art of Pizza, but this pizza takes the crust.  The restaurant is busy sometimes, but it's a cool place.  Delivery is not fast, and the prices are a bit high.  I guess it's so popular that they don't really care about how they treat you."
"I've visited Chicago from NC 4 times now since I have 3 good friends in the city.  They've taken me to numerous popular Chicago pizzerias and Pequod's is by far my favorite of all.  I'm a sauce lover, and I find that many of the other pizzas are lacking in that department, but Pequod's knows how to deliver it!  It's just a great pizza!"
"Out of all the pizzas I've tried, this is the most memorable. The beer selection is awesome as well."
"We ordered Pequod's pizza delivery last night on a whim.  It was so delicious that I didn't even mind the almost 2 hour wait!  They have this amazing ring of burnt cheese around the edge that looks ugly, but tastes devine.  I had canadian bacon and pineapple which was so messy and yummy.  And this is coming from someone who usually prefers thin crust pizza!  The only downside is that this place is expensive for pizza.  But whatever, it's cheaper than what I would normally pay for dinner, and i ate it in my pajamas sprawled out watching the travel channel!"
"Great Pan pizza, I agree with Steve R, the thin crust is pretty weak-needed more sauce in my opinion, and think crusts should be crispy not doughy, they should call it hand tossed not thin crust, I would definately go back for the pan if was in the neighborhood!our service was pretty good...can't complain about that..."
"Best Pizza I have ever had. I have trusted Yelp reviews in every city I have gone to and I have never been let down. This was no exception. Garlic cheese bread and pan pizza. My wife had garlic on her half of the pizza, we forgot mints...big mistake. She had to ride home in the back seat. I had sausage on my side and I could have made a meal just from the toppings!"
"I must add my two cents...I enjoy the cheese on my pizza to be what most would consider burned...I prefer to call it toasted and chewy.  Anywho, Pequod's is a useful discovery for me because of their renowned pan pizza with its wring of carmelized cheese on the crust.  It just adds another layer of flavor to their already yummy pizza.  Though I prefer a saucier pizza, their fresh and puffy crust and generous ingredient amounts make up for the sauce deficit.  Chicago's pizza and pretty much any other type is for when you are drunk, rowdy, and trying to stop a hangover.Pequod's (and I suppose Malnati's is in the same ballpark) is for a sober night when you will remember the experience."
"This is the definitive Chicago deep dish pizza.  Lou Malnati's is a close second, with Uno's and Due's tied for third depending on how many tourists you have to claw through to get a seat.  There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said before.  If you're going to see a movie at the theater across the street, give yourself about two hours to come here and get a delicious dinner beforehand."
plus 1/2Awesome caramelized crust. You can tell the sauce is scratch made.Fresh garlic Bread. Fast delivery. A little pricier than te average pizza but worth an investment for a pizza occassion!Reccommended. They deliver far as well!
"Come here for the pizza, that's where Pequods shines... Very crispy crust with melt-y cheese, and tons of toppings. Personally, i think the pizza is just a touch heavy on the sauce, but, not enough to deter me from coming here. There's usually always a wait, but you can grab a beer from the bar and watch whatever game is on until your name is called. Appetizers are your standard fried options, nothing spectacular. Like I said though, the pizza, makes it all worthwhile. During lunch time throughout the week, if you can, stop by. It's pretty quiet in there, and they offer fantastic lunch specials."
"We've been to Pequod's a few times and I am finally writing a review.  This is Chicago pizza!  Be prepared to wait, however, because everyone knows about this place.  I recommend making a reservation.  You will still wait, but at least there is hope!  The pizza itself is a terrific deep-dish that comes out hot from the oven.  The place is beyond packed, but they have a secret upstairs that I just found out about.  Give it a try for great Chicago pizza!"
"My favorite pizza in Chicago. The caramelized, over cooked crust is super delicious. If you're tired of cornmeal crust, this is definitely for you. I can't think of a better winter food in Chicago."
Wow. That's about all I can say pequod's. We had the deep dish and it's far superior to malnati's or Giordano's.  This will definitely be added to my regular rotation!
This place has amazing deep dish pizza - the thin crust is also very good.  One of my new favorites!!
"This place is the place to go for Chicago-style deep dish pizza.I have had plenty of Chicago deep dish and this is by far my favorite.  The caramelized cheese crust creates flavor like I have never had.  I would go just for that.  I usually get a large pie with half pepperoni and half sausage.  I like to have leftovers to eat later...The service is great.  The bartender/manager knew my face after only 2 visits.  Impressive.The atmosphere is laid back.  It seems like your typical bar.  It has plenty of TV's and plenty of booths.  It can get crowded on weekends.  The wait, though, is never too long. 15 is the longest I have ever waited.  Pequod's is the best.GO THERE NOW."
"So some friends of mine were in town from D.C. and were all ""OM NOM DEEP DISH,"" and I wanted to go to Giordano's, but a bartender at a miscellaneous Milwaukee Street bar was like ""go to Pequod's instead.""After some finagling, we got there and hoo boy was it worth it. We had the spinach deep dish and I discovered that I would never go to Giordano's for a full deep dish pizza again. The sauce, the cheese, the caramelized crust -- everything was perfect. It particularly impressed my D.C. friends, since deep dish pizza apparently does not exist on the east coast.One thing we learned, though: don't come here and order mixed drinks. They do indeed have a full bar, but when asked what vodka they had, the waitress said ""uh, you know, like, normal vodka."" I certainly wasn't expecting a panoply of vodkas, but at least a ""rail, stoli, and something fancier than stoli"" would have been helpful."
"This place is amazing!!!! This is hands down the best pizza in Chicago. Anytime visitors come into town and are looking for great Chicago pizza, this is where I send them. I wish they had more locations! The crust on their pan pizza is phenomenal and I highly recommend the deep dish. Thin crust is good as well, but if you're there, you might as well harness your chi and go for the real thing. You only live once, right? Prices are reasonable too and the pizza makes fantastic leftovers."
"OMG...perfect Deep Dish Pizza.  Had the sausage, pep and onions.  Buttery crust and gobs of sausage and pepperoni.  A total local hangout.  Met up with my buddy who lives in Wrigley.  What a great recommendation."
Not a bad place for a group if you have a reservation. I am a bit biased as I love pizza in general but this pizzeria's pizzas sure have a good crunch (the basic of a good pizza!). I also liked the ease of parking in the area (for free!) Definitely returning to try some other toppings.  Good job Pequod!
"Their pan pizza is fantastic. Things I like about it: Focaccia-like Carmelized crust, burnt mozzarella on the ends, meatball sized sausage, large ingredients, and enough cheese and sauce to make is a chicago-styled pan pizza. The sausage may have changed a little bit when Burt sold the place. It's got a little more spice. It's seems more like an italian sausage than a more mild sausage that is signature at Burt's and other deep-dish main-stays in chicago.The restaurant has a good beer-selection-- not the best in Lincoln Park, but they have plenty of Micro-brews. The Clybourne location also has a second level so you're not going to wait long on the weekend. The main floor has plenty of TVs and has a nice renovated interior.I also like that they put a sheet of tin foil over the pizza when you get carry out. It really seems to trap in the heat. I love watching the steam come out of the box when I open it."
"This is one of two super favorite pizza places in the city.  I am not a huge fan of chains, so this is a great place to get great pizza, without having that chain restaurant stamp ruin the experience.  I would personally recommend the pan pizza if you go there to eat it for a meal.  Otherwise, the thin crust is a very good substitute.The service is great, and the place is quite laid back.  Another nice thing is that I don't think I have ever had to wait too long for a table, if at all.  There's also a full bar with good beers that would go really well with the pizzas.My favorite part about coming here is that I know I will have good pizza to eat the next morning, as there are always leftovers, and what good is pizza if there are no leftovers for that late night, early morning cold pizza craving!"
"Easily my favorite pizza in Chicago. The sauce is just so savory and perfect. The crust is fantastic, and everything just goes so well together. This is place gets super crowded, so I'd definitely recommend going with a small group. I always want to eat here, I just love it so much. Perfect before going over to the theater across the street."
Believe the hype. It' s pretty darn good. Much better than Gino's but not quite Lou's status.
"After a late night meeting, we decided to go to Pequod's recently due to good recommendations.I recall maybe going to this place years ago but I can't remember.  Maybe it was another pizza place nearby.We ordered bruscetta for our appetizer, which was very good.  The perfect portions for the two of us.  We ordered a sausage/mushroom pizza which was a great pizza, among one of my favorites around Chicago.  Wash it down with a cold beer and that makes me happy."
LOVEEE this pizza!! it is a very unique deep dish you wont find anywhere else in chicago. Gotta go with the classic cheese and sausage deep dish... I just wish they had a little more seating in their lincoln park location!
"GREAT pizza! Our friends took us to this local join since we were visiting and my husband really wanted to have some ""REAL"" chicago deep dish! Great amazing pizza...and according to my husband, ""life-changing"" :)"
"Hands down the BEST pizza in Chicago.... I am not even a fan of deep dish pizza, but it is absolutely divine. I am happy with canadian bacon (need a little bit of meat in my life!) with fresh spinach and extra garlic. YUM.  Even though I am a total fat kid with eating the pizza, I have to also have the Pequod's salad w/ their vinagrette dressing on the side. If you aren't up in Lincoln Park/Lakeview area... it is a haul from downtown, but worth it.  Don't do those other places that might be mentioned in your tourist guide. Trust me!  I found this place a year after I had lived in Chicago after I had sworn off deep dish pizza. My favorite meal in Chicago.  I know... I am high maintence.  : )UPDATE: I converted 2 more of my co-workers to Pequod's....heehee... its like pizza crack."
"Pequod's is on our list of delivery restaurants that get a ""special place"" on the fridge.  They deliver a particularly satisfying brand of pizza that is not in competition with Lou M. or Gino's -- Pequod's is in a league of their own.  The one drawback is the price.  A large deep dish pie with pepperoni (easily feeds 3 people) will run you $23 (not including the tip for delivery)."
"Delicious deep dish pizza.  Flavorful sauce and yummy crust.  They could maybe balance a little less sauce with more cheese, but hey, who am i to say...yay! definitely a fan."
"Came into Pequod's with my fiancée after losing yet another softball game. We were bumming about our lack of softball prowess, and pizza heals all wounds. Pequod's has a sports bar atmosphere, a natural fit in a sporty town like Chicago, but its clear that on ""game night"" this place is going to be packed. Its a relatively small bar/restaurant, with short little booths made for two, and barstool flanked tables surrounded by Chicago sports memorabilia and flat-screen TVs. We kept it simple: soda, salad, sausage-spinach-mushroom deep dish pie. Our server brought our drinks and salads quickly; service here is brisk and friendly. The house salad was simple - chopped lettuce, sliced black olives, a slice of tomato, shredded carrots, all dressings on the side. Comforting in its simplicity. Our pizza took another 20-25 minutes, pretty standard for a deep dish place. I was hesitant about getting deep dish because I can't stand the typical heavy, buttery, pastry-dough crusts that so many Chicago-style places employ. When it came out, I saw that the cheese had oozed out onto the sides of the well-seasoned cast iron skillet, and I was briefly debating how greasy everything was going to be. But yessss...I was extremely pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the crust on Pequod's pizza! How Pequod's can take a thick layer of tangy, crunchy-on-the-bottom but light-on-the-inside crust, smother it with cheese, bright tomato sauce, and fresh spinach, herby golfball sized chunks of sausage, and fresh mushrooms and have it NOT be a belly bomb is kind of a pizza miracle. I ate two slices of medium-sized pie and felt full without that greaseball quesiness I get from just one slice of ""the other guys"" stuff. This just might be the best deep dish I've had in Chicago.Based on pizza alone this place is 5 stars. I'd happily go back and have it again and again...provided there's no game on, so I can avoid the crowds."
"Yes, the burnt edge on the crust is AMAZING! But I feel like the crust to topping ratio for the rest of the pizza is skewed too much to the crust side.  And I was saddened to know that the thin crust didn't have the same delicious burnt crust.  I really wish they would just bake my pizza in a super loooooong rectangular pan so there would be more of that delicious carmelized cheese or that they would combine the thin crust with the carmelized crust.  Oh well.  You can't get everything you want in life.I don't usually get a lot of toppings on my pizza and usually opt for just cheese.  However, I always get sausage and mushrooms here.  It's not the same without it.  I think the sausage helps to counteract the sauce. Yes, it's on the sweet side.  And I HATE sweet sauces.  Honestly think that Aurelio's and D'Agastino's are worse than Domino's (and I mean before they ""improved"" it) but somehow I'm ok with it here.I've never eaten here and have always done delivery or pick up.  I can only imagine it's even better fresh out of the oven."
"was there yesterday on a Sunday with a party of 15 yes 15 and our table was available as soon as we arrived, our server was awesome and sweet and the food was delicious.  the deep dish pizza is amazing and tasty.  we will definitely be adding pequods to our outings more often!"
"I have to admit I am not a huge fan of deep dish, and as a native Chicagoan this is kind of a sin.  My redemption came with Pequod's.  I love the carmelized crust on their pizza so much that I will eat the crusts off the leftovers before I eat the guts. I always order some of their fried zuccini with ranch dressing which is good because everything is good with ranch dressing, but still. I always used to give myself some extra time to eat at Pequod's prior to a movie at Webster Place, but now.... They deliver to Ukranian Village!!!"
"I flew out to Chicago to seek out Deep dish pizza, and I found it! Went to Burt's Place in Morton Grove, it was like so what. I was so fired up for Burt's, that was a major reason I flew out. So I got back on with my fellow yelpers in Chicago, and you guys made my trip worth it with Pequod's Pizza. Pequod's was night & day, super tasty. Thanks Chicago! By the way Wrigley Field was awesome too... Respect!"
"Although, it's obvious below a lot of people are digging my favorite Chi-town pizzeria.  I've, also, noticed a lot of reviews of people who aren't feeling it.To help, here's some ordering advice when hitting up Pequod's:If you like Sausage Pizza ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan PizzaIf you like Veggie Pizza ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan PizzaIf you like Thin Crust Pizza ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan PizzaIf you like Pepperoni Pizza with Mushrooms or Green Peppers or something else ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan PizzaThe thing that makes their pizza so good is that caramelized outer crust and the crisp 'roni's on top.  It's niche pizza and when you order other toppings I've found that it just doesn't work right and the excess moisture in those other toppings doesn't lead to that crusty deliciousness.If you don't like Pepperoni Pan Pizza, you're better off going somewhere else.  If you like Pepperoni Pan Pizza, this is the best."
"Best pizza in the city, and probably the whole world, since this is Chicago. Lou Malnati's is a close second, but the carmelized crust takes my heart."
"this place kinda rules.  i've been here once for dine-in (thanks to e. for introducing me!) and once i ordered a pizza for carryout.  both times the deep dish pizza was excellent.  i'm not a huge fan of deep dish...usually 3 or 4 is good enough for a year for me, but pequod's has changed my mind.  i really like how it's not 90% cheese like most other deep dish, and this will sound silly but, the pepperoni is crispy.  YES.  limp pepperoni just doesn't do it for me.aside from that, the atmosphere was fun and relaxing, the service was great and the price was reasonable too.  just like when i get ready to eat at pequod's, i'm saving room (to give them more stars!) just in case a closer one opens up or is a bit more accessible."
"Let it be known that this place has the best PAN pizza.... not deep dish, not suffed, not Chicago Style.... the best PAN pizza. Remember the days when you were a kid and in the ""Book-It"" club and after 4 stars you got a free personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut? No? Well, I do. It was the best thing ever as a child. Well, Pequods' delivers the best for us adults that rememeber those days. I never thoguht burnt cheese would taste so good until Pequod's delivered it to me! FYI---The Pequod: The name of the boat in Moby Dick... I had to ask the bartender b/c I never read it."
"When I first moved to Chicago i told a friend that I'm not into Pizza, he told me Pequod's would change my mind. He was more than right. Pequod's is the most delicious pizza i have ever had, and one of my favorite restaurants. I have tried a lot of the toppings but i go with sausage and mushroom. The sausage pieces are really big and really good. However the best part of the whole deal is the Caramelized cheese on the crust. Its scrumptious!!Being friends with a bunch of guys I eat pizza from a lot of different places.Pequod's is hands down the best pizza in Chicago. It is the only place I recommend to someone who wants a traditional deep dish Chicago pizza. My Roomie and I just moved a couple blocks from it, and that is a dangerous situation especially since i have discovered that they have a 5 dollar lunch special for a personal pan and a soda (or a Beer!) (m-F only)"
"Lifelong Chicago resident and have tried alot of deep dish over the years. This is one of the best. I am not a big ""bready crust"" lover so the thinner, true-pan crust is perfect.  Old time feel to the place and decent tap beer. YUM.(I also wonder if anyone knows the whale-thong history..)"
Amazing sick deep dish pizza that takes 40 minutes to bake but well worth the wait. Great beer list. Only complaints are the noise level and there was barely any air conditioning so I was sweating the whole time. Service was so so although the host is very accommodating.
"Get pepperoni on your deep dish.  Trust me, it's worth the extra calories.  Also important to note: Lots of cops in this joint, which reaffirms my opinion that Chicago's Finest know how to sniff out good grub.And if you're under 21, it's probably not a good idea to try to pass off a fake ID with the po-po all up in here."
hands down the best deep dish .. EVER .. nothing compares to that caramelized crust .. truly delicious ..
"I love my Pequod's. The carmelized cheese on the crust puts this at the top of my Chicago pizzas list. It also helps that I've never waited more than ten minutes for a table (of course, I eat during grandpa times, but that didn't help at Gino's East). Decent beers, decent atmosphere, good salads, but you're here for the pizza, and it's the best there is."
"Pequod's Pizza is what is served in heaven.  This to me is the best pizza in the city.  Plus, as a lonely jew on Christmas it is open...and it has become a tradition for my wife and I to get Pequod's every Christmas.  We get a half pepperoni half green pepper and onion and before I eat it I like to stare at it for a few minutes, sort of like the same feeling I had the first time I saw Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts in ""Can't Hardly Wait""...very similar experiences for me."
"In terms of Chicago-style pizza, I think this is the place to be. I'm also a fan of Pizzeria Due, but I think Pequods wins out on taste; don't jump on my back for this judgment, I know that Chicago-style pizza loyalties are serious business.Anyway, this is a great spot to go for pizza, a Hawks game on TV, and some pretty decent beers on tap (all great options).  Mind you, if you're thinking 'oh, I'm getting pizza, this will be a cheap night out,' it's not that kind of joint.  While the atmosphere is very laid back, Peqouds adds up price-wise, though you really get what you pay for, and will never leave hungry.  Parking on the street kind of sucks, but transit isn't bad, nor are the bike routes getting there."
"Our group came away with mixed reviews about the place, however those that didn't like the place as much are thin crust fans. I personally loved the pizza. I had it on Saturday and I kept thinking about sunday night and even today monday. We ordered a Large Pan Pizza with Sausage, Canadian Bacon and Tomatoes. The ingredients where top notch. Everyone agreed on that. The crust is thick, however the bread isn't very dense. I thought it was great, other thought it was too much bread... but they are thin crust fans. Most enjoyed the burnt crust and cheese."
LOVE this place.  Such great pizza.  It's so good that they have to be usuing Crack as the main ingredient.
"Yes! This pizza is excellent! The thick crust is great, but the thin crust is my fave..and its one of very few pizzas my girlfriend and I can agree on. The crust is awesome.. not too thin, but not too thick. The sauce is sweet and plentiful. If you eat at the restaurant, please notice the neon whale wearing women's panties on his head. NICE."
"I love Pequod's for a pre-movie (at the Webster theaters) dinner.  The thin crust is my personal favorite, partly because they leave the thicker crust around the edges so you have something to grab on to!  They're also pretty generous with the toppings.  We usually get pepperoni and green peppers and let me tell you, that thing is PACKED.The appetizers are standard, nothing especially outstanding, but my girlfriend seems to be a fan of the jalepeno poppers (I have no problem 'helping' her eat them).  Service is always pleasant and very helpful.  I don't think I've ever had to ask anyone to refill any beverage, water, soda or beer or for anything else.  That's the kind of service that makes me really want to go back.  And we do (we also order a lot of delivery...go figure).The restaurant is a little on the small side, but the wait isn't too long usually because there's a pretty good turnover, especially on a weekend night.  Two people can eat a nice dinner before a movie for less than $25 (which almost how much two movie tickets cost!!)."
Great pizza and great atmosphere.  You can't go wrong ordering a pizza from Pequod's and watching hockey.
"It took me nearly four years of living in Chicago to discover one of it's finest offerings in pizza. Forget gino's easy or giodarnos. Pequod's is the best deep dish I've had so far and it's even worth the nearly two hour wait for delivery. I loved the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas I've had from here. In case you're wondering they do deliver downtown so pick up your phone and place an order next time you want a good, not-so-healthy Chicago treat."
"First time going to Pequods.  I have been a big fan of Lou Malnotis, so I was a little critical at first.  Well, I have to say, Pequods does do the key deep dish things right.  One, the toppings are great.  We have pepperoni, Sausage, green peppers, and onions.  The sauce was bland, but let the toppings really shine out.  They also do this awesome thing with the cheese all the way to the edge of the crust.  This is really the best part.  Good service, but just like any deep dish it takes a while to cook.  Be patient, its worth it."
"The pan pizza is all I've had and it's pretty great - my fave is spinach, mushrooms and black olives.  Staff is friendly, the place is busy (but I've never had to wait to be seated), and it's not expensive at all.  I recommend going before a movie at Webster Place -- park at the theater, eat dinner, and parking is only $2 once you get the movie validation..... cheaper than the meters (and movie theater crap food), you've hopefully seen a decent flick and you're belly is full of yum-o pizza.  Perfect Date Night."
This was the first time I'd been here in a very long time (over 7 yrs ago).  We went on a Saturday night which also happened to be St. Patty's day weekend. The place was packed w/ loud & drunk depaul kids and we got seated after about 15 minutes. The pizza was well worth it though! My boyfriend and I ordered the medium thin crust---still awesome after all these years! I'd definitely recommend!
"Delicious! My favorite Chicago pizza place. Food is always excellent, good staff and delivers late, what else could you ask for"
"Best pizza in the city, in my opinion. Pan style is all I get and it is AMAZING. Carmelized crust and all. Never have drink specials and wings are disappointing, but the pizza is so damn good, I dont even care!"
"Great pizza--some of the best we've ever had.  My husband is a Chicago native, and there are a couple of ""must-haves"" when we're back in the city.  Pizza is at the top of the list, and this was outstanding.  We ordered the thin crust for our grandkids, and that was good, but the deep dish will be something we talk about for a long time.  Worth a ten-hour drive!"
Pequod's deep dish pizza can be summed up in three words. BEST PIZZA EVER.
"Best Pizza in Chicago, hands down. I am a pizza lover, so when I was told about Pequod's two years ago I couldn't wait to put it to the test. If I'm out seeing a movie it is at the Webster Theatre which is right across the street, so a pizza and movie night is perfect for me. I have read that some people think they have too much crust, but I disagree. It's delicious and the way it is served, each piece remains hot. Another thing, Pequod's is so reasonably priced. Worth every penny! They will even hold your leftovers for you until you get out of the movie!"
"Hands down the best pizza in Chicago.  Try a pan pizza with pepperoni and pineapple and add an order of jalapeño poppers.  Their lunch special ($4.95 7"" inch pan cheese plus single topping with a soda - Mon thru Fri 11 am to 3 pm) is one of the best deals in the city.  Plus the logo is a whale with panties on it's head.  What's not to love?"
By far the best deep dish.  The crust is delicious and the burnt cheese on the crust is mind-blowing.  A sausage deep-dish from here can turn any day around.  It's a little out of the way for out-of-towners but way more worth the trip than going to Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's if you're visiting Chicago.
"The pizza was just fantastic...my brother- in-law said we had to try it so we went early on a saturday nite . It was just starting to get busy but we were able to get a nice cozy booth for two.Unfortunatley our waitress did not have much of a personality,but the pizza defininatly speaks for itself!!!The crust was just dark enough, the body was lite and airy ,the sauce was full of flavor and the cheese was browned to perfection. this place is a winner in my book!! looking forward to going back..."
"Man, this place is real chi deep dish done right.  Not like those of the better known i.e. Gino's Giordano's Lou's etc. I brought an out of towner hoping to show him deep dish at its best.    A bit lighter i.e. less cheese and dough, this place is by far the best deep dish I've had.  We had a medium 'pan' topped with spinach, mushrooms, canadian bacon, and sausage and could barely finish more than half.   (Note, leftover pizza that evening wasn't quite as good, I think it's best enjoyed on the spot.)   Definitely will be back here for more.  Staff is friendly, and quick to refill drinks.  Love it!"
Omg this is the best pizza I have ever had!! I have been here a few times before and whenever I'm in Chicago I come here. Both deep dish and thin crust are amazing and they deliver till 3 in the morning which is awesome. I have been to other pizza places in Chicago but nothing beats pequods.
"My Dad and I decided to take a trip up to watch our beloved Cardinals take on the Cubs and check out a pizza joint. After looking on Yelp, we decided that Pequod's would be the place to go. After having Pizzeria Uno taken from us here in St. Louis, we were itching for a solid deep dish. WOW! This place is amazing! The price was just right and next time I go with one other person, I'll still get a large because it was great to bring back home. I've already recommended it to anyone and everyone that lives/visits Chicago. I'll be back!"
"Best pizza ever! I have all my out of town friends and family hooked on this.  Every time they come to see me, we always have to go to pequods.  Make sure you order the deep dish, though.  Otherwise, you may not get the full pizza bliss experience."
"Just like any Chicagoan, I have tried a lot of different pizza.  Peqoud's is amazing.  They even deliver to my apartment, which is great.  I have dined at the restaurant once. It was busy, but we didn't have to wait long for a table. I really want to try the salad next time because someone at a table next to us had one and it looked delicious.  Also tried the mozzarella sticks, but they were pretty much standard. The other times, I have gotten delivery and it takes sort of awhile (45-hour) but the pizza arrives hot and fresh.The pizza. Obviously got the pan pizza.  I don't really like the bottom part of the crust, it's a little dry.  The caramelized cheese part was delicious and so were the sauce and cheese.  Peqoud's is definitly one of my top three pizzas of Chicago!"
"Greasy, tons of toppings... hot heaping mounds of delicious-ness.  This is what Chicago-style pizza is supposed to be.  It seems a bit expensive ($20s for a pie) but if you can finish more than 2 slices of a large you're more of a man than I am.I highly recommend pep/mush combination... they cover the pizza with so many toppings you almost forget there's 5 pounds of cheese underneath.Delivery has always been quick and friendly.  Pizza always shows up hot.Cool point - reheats VERY well in the oven.  Which is good, because my 2 roommates and I were never able to finish a large."
"Reasons why I'm in love with Pequod's:1. The atmosphere--this place has a real pizzeria feel, right down to the brick walls, the wooden booths, the TVs in every corner, and the little waitresses yelling out to the bartender ""TWO DIETS"" in a tubular Chicago accent whenever we asked for a refill on our pops.2. The people--this place is NOT pretentious. You won't find any yuppies or business suits here. The crowd is friendly, laid-back, and comfortable in their jeans and tee shirts. Another plus is that it's a little bit off-track from the typical tourist-destination Chicago pizza joints, so I don't see that many touristy family excursions here too often.3. The pizza--It's better than Giordano's, but then again, most pizzerias are. (Oh yeah, I just went there. ) The pan pies are fantastic. The dough actually has flavor, and then of course, there's that carmelized cheese. It may not be the best pizza you've ever encountered in your life (or maybe it is!), but it damn sure will come close. One downside to Pequod's--no free refills! I know, I know. What is this, like, 1876? Who doesn't give free refills nowadays? The first time that happened to me at Pequod's, I wound up ringing up a tab of $16 just on diet pepsi refills alone! Criminy!"
"What's better on a Friday night!!  Beer and the best pizza in Chicago!!!!A friend was visiting from out of town and the Chicagoan's of the group all choose Pequod's.  Very easy to make a reservation, however, since they've remodeled the newer place has alot more seating.  Pitchers of beer were affordable, large pan pizza was to die for, and a medium thin crust was actually kinda gross.  I would not opt to get that at all.  Also, the garlic cheese bread was yummy too!All together the bill ended up being less than $17 per person!  Great dinner choice!!"
"After all of the hype, I finally had Pequod's for the first time last night. (Thanks to grub hub, I discovered they deliver to my place!) The pizza was absolutely amazing. We got plain cheese and I wish I was still eating it right now! That caramelized cheese is to die for! I love cheese on anything and everything and the crust is no exception. The pizza was ready and delivered in an hour which is better than other local places I've tried.If you're looking for delicious pan pizza, Pequod's has to be one of the best in Chicago!"
"I've been to Pequod's many many times - enough to write a fair review.  I give their deep dish pizza at least 4 to 5 stars because it's hand's down a delicious pizza.  Their crust is amazing (it's a little burnt with a nice carmalized crunch - just the way I love it!).  The host and the service, now that is a different rating all together - I give the service two stars and the host zero stars.  Their pizza is definitely better than Giordano's or Gino's East.  I keep going back because I love the pizza - that is the only reason.  The host is a complete joke.  One time we got there on a Saturday night and gave the host our name for the wait list.  Shortly after, he began seating five groups that arrived after us.  I was very upset because my group only consisted of two people, so I said something and he kept mumbling some ridiculous excuses that didn't make sense.  We waited for an hour and twenty minutes before he sat us.  I no longer go there at nights on the weekends - it's a nightmare to get seated and the service is extremely slow (you will wait for over an hour to be seated).  One time we waited an hour and twenty minutes for our pizza to arrive at our table - of course, it was cold.  It must have been sitting in the kitchen the entire time.  Also, the waitresses seem to be really slow.  I must say that they offer a sensational lunch special for five bucks - which I highly recommend.  As you can see, I have mixed review about this place, but I keep going back because the pizza is my favorite.   I am willing to tolerate the obnoxious host (the skinny guy with glasses) and the slow service just to take a bite of their delicious deep dish pizza!"
"My favorite pizza ever of all time. Seriously, it's the best. Get the deep dish and you will not be disappointed!"
"this place is awesome and there's a reason why this place is always packed for dinner.  it's definitely one of the best deep dish pizzas i've had in chicago.  my friend was starting to complain that the mozzarella sticks were just the frozen type that you can make at home.  but... i had to remind him that a) they're only $3.50, and b) it's really all about the pizza.  you can't go into this place expecting or wanting it to be something that it's not, other than good food with good service, ambiance, etc.  make sure you get fresh basil as an ingredient and it will make everything A-OK.  p.s. on our way out, every single employee (and there are a lot on a friday night) said some variation of ""goodbye and thank you for coming in.""  awesome."
omg!!! best pizza i have ever tasted!!! love this place...but i live in cali and cant come back frequently:( i will be back soon though!:)
It's the only deep dish pizza I will eat-love it!  They carmelize the crust like no other.  Really puts other pizzerias to shame.
"I don't even like deep dish pizza very well, but this is the best pizza on the planet.  Eat it there if you can.  Take home is great but there is nothing like eating it fresh out of the oven."
"Good Yelp recommendations brought me here.  The pie is loaded, crust is crunchy and caramelized.  For one person, the small size is a bit light.  Fairly noisy, local crowd.  Good beer selection."
"This is definitely NOT Spacca Napoli, which can be a good thing.  Delicious satisfying stick-to-your-ribs slightly carmelized goodness!"
"Best pizza in the city in my humble opinion.  I've tried every other big name place, but none of them really match up to what Pequods does, and it seems like everyone I take there/have eat food from there agrees.  The whole concept of the crust being caramelized cheese sounds a little strange at first, but believe me, you get used to it after about oh, 1 bite.Also, they have a very good/cheap lunch special(at least they did the last time I was there).  Places like this make me wonder why Pizza Hut and ""pizza"" places of that ilk are even still in existence."
First time trying Pequod's tonight. Amazing!! We will definitely be back.
"Since I've relocated from upstate New York to Chicago one of the consistent questions I get from friends and family has been ""how's that great Chicago pizza"". Unfortunately I haven't been able to answer it with enthusiasm. I've tried the places that people rant and rave about; Gino's East, Giordano's, Pizano's, Pieces and a few others. While none of them were disappointing, they didn't live up to the expectations of Chicago pizza. I thought maybe that the great Chicago deep dish was a myth, something we New Yorkers had made up. Then I found Pequod's Pizzeria. Now that's some Chicago deep dish pizza!Pequod's has a very unassuming location on the 2200 block of North Clybourn. The seating area appears clean and tidy, but reminds you more of a bar than it would a pizzeria. The staff there is friendly and courteous, greeting and seating us the minute we stepped in. They even offered us better seating in the rear to get away from the cold air coming in as patrons entered and exited the restaurant. They serve both deep dish and thin crust pizzas in small, medium and large sizes (10"", 12"", 16"") along with an array of appetizers. They offer an assortment of toppings but this being my first adventure I decided to stick with the tried and true topping of pepperoni. While we waited, a couple next to us was putting a hurting on a medium pizza that looked really good. They overheard us talking and piped in with ""This is going to be the best pizza you've had in the city"". High praise but I had heard it all before.The pizza came out and it looked absolutely delectable. The first thing I noticed is that the edge of the pizza appeared to be darkened, almost like it had been burned. The waitress assured me that it was perfectly normal due to their famous ""caramelized crust"". I dove in and it was heaven. For those of you who like Gino's East, this is basically Gino's pizza with a helping of perfection added in. It has a very similar cornmeal like crust to the pizza, but it doesn't seem to taste as strong, which is a good thing. The pizza is very saucy, like Gino's, but not to the point where it's incredibly messy. The pepperoni was cooked exactly how i like it, where it's a bit crispy, but not burned. The portions were a good size as well. A small pizza split between two people should be enough for most, although if you want leftovers you may want to go with a medium.All that being said, Pequod's has been the best pizza experience I've had since moving to Chicago. Now when friends and family come to visit, I know exactly where to take them. If you're in the neighborhood I would suggest stopping in. There's a Kerasotas movie theatre right across the street as well, easily making a night of it if you're not close by."
I just love this thick crust pizza!  And the crust.  OH lord it gives me the vapors just thinking about it!  Muy muy delicioso!
"Pretty good pizza but overrated in my opinion.  I was really looking forward to it and don't get me wrong, it pretty tasty, but not as good as I was hoping."
"Favorite deep dish in town, hands down.  Plus, the cheesy bread is pretty spectacular.  The crust is perfectly carmelized, and this place is conveniently located across the street from the movie theatre for a low-key dinner before the movies."
"The Best Pizza in Chicago!!! Def, my fav. :-) The Weekends get packed, expect a 30-45 min wait, but it's sooo worth it!"
In top contention for my favorite pizza in Chicago. My norm is the pan pizza with black olives and green peppers. With their pan pizzas I always find the thickness of the dough to take away from the overall flavor. But it is all worth it when you make it to the crust. Amazing!
"In a city full of awesome pizza joints, Pequod's easily holds its own.  What makes it so good is that it is completely different from other pizzas in town.  The standard Pequod's pie falls somewhere between the ubiquitous Chicago deep-dish and the standard delivery fare.  The crust is thick, but light and buttery, the sauce is substantial, but not too sweet, and the burnt, crispy cheese hugging the crust is a thing of beauty.  Sure, once you knock down a couple slices, you'll feel like an aggressive baby is trying to punch his way out of your stomach.  But I'm a firm believer that sometimes you need to suffer for your food."
"The crust is amazing. The toppings are solid.  The service is good.  They remodeled but I still like the atmosphere.  I just wish the bread/crust was a little thinner on the pan pizzas (-1 star).  NOT the outer caramelized crust but the rest of the pie.    Either way, one of the best PAN pizzas around and I'm a pizza snob."
"My favorite of the non-chain pizzerias.  Their pizza is the bomb.  However, I liked it better when it was this hole in the wall place with about 6 tables ... now, it's a family affair.  Good for them, but like many old fuddy duddies, I become nostalgic for what was."
Going here for years before the yuppies took over but this place still my spot for pizza. Sausage is flame stop order it and go deep dish.  Packed on the weekend so enjoy.
"Chicago deep dish is wiggling all of its casserole-like goodness into my heart.  And Pequod's is helping convert me into an official deep disher - tart tomato sauce, burnt-crust that was moist on the inside, perfectly crunch on the outside, and lots-and-lots-o-cheese.  Unfortunately, Pequod's only offers ""design your own pies"" (this is starting to seem like common practice in Chicago), and not-so-many topping options (no unusual options or gourmet cheese choices), but this is far made up for my their ah-mazing $4.95 lunch deal!  $4.95 for a 7""- 1 topping pizza and a domestic macro pint!  I LOVE a good deal!  The smaller, individually sized pizza means no sharing necessary!  No topping selection arguments between me and the bf! And results in a pizza with a great crust-to-pie ratio!  YUM."
"4.5* Deep Dish. 1/2 Sausage Onions, 1/2 Pepperoni Mushrooms"
"I rarely rate anything a 5 star, but htis pizza is THAT good.  Love the deep dish wth big chunks of frsh veggies.  They carmelize the cheese on the edges of the za, a real treat!"
I love the crust!  That is the best part!  It's crumbly and light - not too doughy like a lot of deep dish places in the city.  The caramelized edges are so good.  We got Green Pepper and Tomato - our favorite combo.  I could care less about the service at a pizza joint - it was really busy the door kept opening like every 2 minutes....but the staff handled it well.  We didn't wait for anything expect our check.  Great pizza!!!!  I will certainly go back :)
"If you're looking for regular generic pizza, don't come here. If you are looking for a pie with delicious crust, fresh toppings & gooey cheese, this is it. We love their delivery - it takes 45 min (the pie takes a bit to cook) but it always arrives steaming hot & on time.If you are looking for an app, their breaded mushrooms are delicious.It's hard to get a seat, that's why we opt for delivery."
"How many pizzas have I had in my life?I have no idea, but if the pizza auditors gave me a number well into the thousands, I wouldn't dispute it. That said, Pequod's is, without question, the best pizza I have ever had put in my mouth. Fresh ingredients, carmelized crust, perfectly baked. Pequod's alone is worth the trip to Chicago.Michael Armstrong, Bexley, Ohio"
Delicious!! Excellent Service and fast delivery!!  We order them all the time and they have never disappointed us!  I also had a large group in there last week and the service and food were fantastic!  I wanted to treat some of my out of town friends to a great Chicago pizza and they loved it!!
"Best deep dish in Chicago as far as I'm concerned.  Can say that I haven't had any thin crust pizza better than Pequod's as well.  Great place to eat, too - staff is very friendly and service is great.  Have been there many times and always a great experience.  Delivery is excellent as well.  Can't miss with this place!"
"The crust is f-ing delicious. The whole pie was still really good, good enough that I have ordered it several more times. But if I could cross breed pequod's crust with a Lou malnatis pizza it would be the greatest pie in the world! Definitely try it and make your own judgement."
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago!  My only knock is that they don't deliver to my neighborhood (West Loop).  It's probably a good thing, I'd be fat from all the pizza I'd be eating! ;)"
"Dropped by for a quick pizza before a movie later (Webster Place is right across the street). Didn't have time for a deep dish (will get one eventually), but the pepperoni thin crust was delish! Not greasy, perfect cheese and crust combination. Couldn't ask for more. Wait staff was super prompt too. Kudos."
"I've been coming here for 5 years  and I have not once had a bad pizza here.  There is something about the pan w/ sausage.  It is very simple, but always outstanding.  Pequod's is easily my go to for pan pizza."
The pizza was delightful. It was better than that of other deep dish establishments in Chicago.
I love Pequod's! Every topping toy ask for is huge! And the crust?!? Forget about it! Slightly burnt for a good charred flavor! The employees there are top notch too. Always a smile and attentive attitude.
"came here yesterday with some friends because they never tried Pequods before. we were seated by the entrance which kinda suck cause whenever ppl leave or enter the restaurant, a cold breeze would come to us. we ordered french fries and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.. the fries came out first and was kinda disappointed because there was alot of ketchup packets on the side .. i mean what restaurants still used ketchup packets instead of a bottle besides fast food places like McDonald's and burger king.. the fries was just ok. after awhile the pizza finally arrived and the person that brought it out would serve it to our plates.. it was delicious! out of all the pizza places i have gone to, i love Pequods the most.. my friends think it was good too.. it tasted fresh and they didn't cheap out in the ingredients like most places do. the service was good too... we will be back soon"
In my opinion this is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. The crust is spectacular as well as their house made sauce. My favorite pizza at Pequod's is the one topped with sausage. Their sausage is also house made and delicious! Order a pitcher of beer and a medium pizza and enjoy the night.
"Deep dish?  Maybe.  Whatever it is, it's the best pizza in Chicago.  The caramelized crust is like taking something that is already amazing and making it even better.  Hmm.  Perhaps like a dollup of butter on a filet.  Or something even more sinful.  Yeah, it's that good."
"This was my first stop for deep dish pizza when I went to Chicago. We had a big group of 16, and they were very accommodating (we did call ahead). We ordered 4 large pizzas for the group with a variety of toppings, and it was more than enough. The pizza was delish, although I thought for deep dish pizza the toppings were underneath the sauce, but here they put them on top. The crust is the real deal here. They bake it in a cast iron pan, and the crust is perfectly done. I also had deep dish pizza again on my trip, and I found that I liked the inside of the pizza better elsewhere, but this place is definitely worth trying. They also have good local beers here, so make you sure you try some of those!"
amazing deep dish and thin crust! crispy and saucy
So f'ing good. It's not chicago style deep dish. It's pan pizza. So delicious. I recommend eating there instead of getting carry out if you don't live in the neighborhood. The crust gets a bit soggy after a 30-min door to door transport. This is one of my favorite places for pizza.
"Forget Gino, Giordano, and any other deep dish pizza place... you'd just be wasting your time.Pequod's is the best Chicago-style deep dish in the city, no question about it.Delivery can take 1+ hour which can be frustrating, but the wait is worth it."
"Yum! Pizza crust was delish. Sausage, Pepperoni and Green olives on top. I highly suggest it. (Can you tell I love salt?)"
"This is the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago. I am not a sauce person, but this sauce is crazy good. The crust is so good and caramelized. Delivery sometimes takes 2 hours. Pick up is about 1 hour. So if you are starving beware about the wait. This place gets very busy. I have been coming here for 12 years and their deep dish has never changed. It is always the same delicious pizza. Best in Chicago. If you have not gone here you have definitely not tried the best Chicago deep dish"
"Really good pizza...thin crust or deep dish.  Went there with a bunch of people after a game and they were accommodating.  Went back for a few drinks after a date and it was still good.  However, parking is sketchy around there."
"Had a deep dish large pizza with 2 friends.  It took about 40 minutes to arrive on a Sunday night; was busy and worth the wait.  The pizza was excellent, with great flavor and ingredients.  We could only eat half so come hungry."
"delicious. After my Lou Malnati's experience i am now obsessed with deep dish pizza.  we ended up here at 6pm on sunday night and had no wait.  The only bad part about deep dish is having to wait for your pizza to get cooked (about 30+ minutes).  however, it was worth it. SO GOOD!  my husband had to stop me at piece number 4 which was a good thing b/c now i have leftovers to eat tonight :)"
"Definately once of my top five pizza joints in Chicago. Very old school, kitsch joint. Pizza takes awhile but that is expected. The prices are very reasonable especially their five dollar lunch special. If you're in Chicago, you should surely try it."
I finally got to try Pequods the other day after I caught a movie. I heard so much about it so it was about time.  AMAZING!  Amazing pizza.. Great service! Definitely coming in one day for the lunch special! :)
"Without repeating too much that has already been said, the choices here for deep dish are amazing. The toppings are delicious, the tomato sauce is superb, and the beer choices are excellent also.You've got to get some Pequod's if you live anywhere near here, or can make the trip. Make an afternoon out of it and go see a movie at the theater across the street afterward. (maybe before, the pizza and beer might put you to sleep)"
"Just fabulous pizza!  Ordered a spinach deep dish with half pepperoni and half sausage.  It arrived on time and piping, finger-burning hot.  Wonderful tomato-ey sauce, plenty of meat, great carmalized cheese on the crust and good crust base.  They'll be my first choice next time I'm looking for deep dish delivery.  Great the next day, too..."
This place is amazing...I am not sure what is up with the whale with the thong on its face but the pizza is heavenly!They bake their pan pizza in a cast iron pan so the cheese gets burnt on the bottom--might sound gross but its really good.The staff their is really nice and patient... I recommend getting garlic on your pizza it adds a little kick!
Far out man!  Their deep dish pizza is amongst the greats in the biz.  Super filling slices of all the good ingredients you could possibly want.  The intentionally burnt back crust trumps any pizza innovation that the mad scientists at pizza hut or dominos could ever come up with.
pequods is the affordable chicago-style deep dish pizza. this is one of two places i will have pizza at in chicago.the crust is amazing. the sauce? sausage? high quality delicious delicious pizza.
"ok, i know i'm late to the game.  i just tried this place like a month or so ago.  my friend ordered it on a movie night and i was hesitant.  i do not  like deep dish so i asked for thin crust.  even though this place is known for deep dish pizza...the thin is out of this world.  i could not stop eating it.  it's really not that thin.  my boyfriend and i went back the other night to have it again.  the service was good and we even had  left overs the next day.  the pizza tasted just as good or not better the next day.  next time i have friends in from out ot town, i'm bringing them here."
"This is my favorite pizza joint.  Being from the east coast, I don't love deep dish, and theirs is a little different than others I've tried here; less heavy, and tastier.  On weekends they will let you make a reservation, but it doesn't get you a table right away.  You just get priority over the people who have just walked in.  But you can put your pizza order in while you wait since it takes so long to cook anyway.Side note, I chose this as my last solid meal before getting my wisdom teeth out!  Must be my favorite meal!"
"This place is finger lickin good!! Yummmyyyy, I loved their pizza and the crust is awesome. The place is always crowded but they seat you down pretty fast. The service is great and the food is delicious go and try it you won't be disappointed!"
"The first time I ate Pequod's was when we had staff meeting at a clinic I used to work at.  At first, I was wondering what the char was on the crust (I'm not questioning why, but what is it?).  My boss said it was cheese, and that made it even better.  Their pizza was very unique, thin crust attributes (""accidental caramel crust"", loaded looking) with the appeal of a stuffed pie (the more to love deal).  It was good, good enough to realize that I sometimes forget that it was a deep dish.  However, to me, the only thing that really got me interested in their pizza was the crust.  The cheese peeled/fell off often, that forced me to reset most of the pizza back on the crust.  And because of caramelizing, the crust was very soggy underneath.  Either way, interesting concept, tasty, but hard to overlook the flaws when you actually eat it."
"I was under the impression that I didn't like deep dish pizza, until I had it at Pequod's. Definitely a great place to bring out of town visitors who want to try out Chicago's best deep dish! I'm sure I'll be doing so a lot in the future."
"Pequod's Pizza sets the standard for deep dish pizza in Chicago, as far as I'm concerned. I've tried other, perhaps more iconic, pizzas, and they do not compare. The taste and texture of the crust, the quality and quantity of the toppings - there is nothing left to be desired. The venue itself is usually crowded, and perhaps not family-oriented (their sign and t-shirts feature a whale with a thong on its head, though my somewhat tight-laced parents didn't mind), but it's perfectly possible to get a table with little notice given."
"Pequod's is truly a unique spot with great pizza.  thin crust is very good but even if you're ant-deep dish, you should try pequod's deep dish. it has carmelized crusty cheese all the way around the pie, just the right amount of toppings and a thick crusty base layer of bread.  many other deep dishes from other restaurants pale in comparison.  Their appetizers (sticks, zuccini, shrooms) are right out of the bag but they show up hot and the portions are good sized.   service is good, often younger staff members who can get a little swamped cuz the place is usually hoppin, but their pleasantness makes up for the occassional ""two minutes on empty"" beer glass.  one of my favorite pizza places in the city."
This is our go-to pizza place.  My favorite deep dish in the City.  And the owner and servers are so nice and hospitable!  My husband and I just love coming here!!
"I like this better than Gino's and Lou Malnati's.  The crust is thick, but not too dense or too dry.  They slather it in sauce, cheese, and whatever toppings you order.  We get mushrooms and sausage, and there is no slice that is lacking large chunks of sausage.I am giving it 4 stars because the wait for a table is loooooong, then you have to wait 45min for the pizza to cook.  If they had more seating I would definitely give it 5 stars.Don't bother with the thin crust pizza, that's not why you eat pizza in Chicago..."
"Usually I prefer thin crust, but I always go deep dish here! It is the best in Chicago. Giordanos has nothing on Pequod's."
"Pequod's has the sickest lunch special in all the land - for $5 you can get a personal pan pizza and a drink (soda or beer).  These personal pan pizzas have a divine and addictive caramelized crust - crispy and a little burnt, and so damn good you'll crave it for weeks.  It is really a good thing I left the contract job I had down the street, because otherwise my health would be in serious jeopardy from daily pizza consumption.  The Pequod's lunch special is a sometimes food."
"Take out only!Highly acclaimed by Rachel as the best Deep Dish Pizza in all of Chicago-land, I opted to grab some take out from Pequod's to sample their offerings.Extra-Large Deep Dish Pizza w/ Sausage & Onions...Perhaps the monstrosity of the Pizza is the first most notable feature of Pequod's offerings.  At first glance, the size of the pizza resembled that of a car tire, rather than ""Pizza"".  The weight alone is enough to scare away any willing participant.  Of course, sampling the offerings should be the most judged critique in the Pizza's execution.  At first consumption, the gluttonous amount of ingredients used in the application is the most noteworthy attribute to Pequod's rendition of Deep Dish Pizza.  The slightly burnt, crispy crust is the first detection during consumption; which acts as the foundation of the monstrosity.  The mild detection of mozzarella cheese is the second of many flavors available.  Although the slew of contrasting elements in both flavor and quantity is the emphasis of Pequod's creation, the taste is ultimately the binding principle.  Patrons consuming this pizza will find that the gluttonous exertion of flavors produced from all elements ranging from the starchiness of the dough, the robust and tart nature of the tomato sauce, and meatiness / mild saltiness from the sausage work in stark contrast and conjunction to create a superb edible.  The excessive amount of all the ingredients used works remarkable well in the creation of both a burdensome but welcoming edible.What Pequod's embodies with their rendition of a Chicago staple is a perfect example of the city's food offerings.  It is through Pequod's embodiment of the mentality of Big Food / Big Flavor approach, that the foundation of their Pizza is created.  With most food, large quantities do not equate to excessive flavors.  Luckily, Pequod's manages to find a balance between both, while supplying an excessive amount of consumables within it's Deep Dish Pizza."
Hands down the best pie in the country!  Pequods is the center of the universe for me now.
Pequod's is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago.  This is as good as it gets!
OMG! This pizza is delicious! I don't even like thick crust or pan pizzas and I cannot stop thinking about the pizza here. The lunch special for $5 (personal pizza and a beer) can't be beat. YUM!!!!
The lunch special cant be beat. Came here for the first ttime with the hubby for lunch on a Tuesday and returned with the whole fam on sunday. Pizza is great. It's not heavy and has a great  crust. Will be back soon.
Hands down the best Chicago style pizza around!! The pizza sauce is so perfectly seasoned it makes you want to ask for extra so you can smother your slice with it - Yes I am guilty of always asking for extra sauce.  As for the dough - Finally!! You can eat a Chicago style pizza without feeling like you are eating a loaf of bread!! Highly Highly recommend.This review would get five stars if it weren't for their lack of service.
"I tried for first time yesterday, and it was great. While the physical space could use some more ambiance, but the pizza was still amazing. It is now my 3rd favorite after Giordano's and The Exchequer. The service was great and I got my pizza in a timely manner. I will definitely go here again!"
"This place...HANDS DOWN...has the best Pan Pizza ""I HAVE"" ever had...so far. The two person booths are very comfortable and the service was average."
"This place deserves a 5 rating as I love the za and have been several times.  However, last Saturday night I took my parents and soon-to-be inlaws for a casual dinner.  We had 8:30 reservations - didn't get seated till 9:15.  The temperature was about 90 degrees - come on, get some AC - its July in Chicago.  Pizza was great as usual but get the service and AC to match it."
"With over 700 reviews there isn't much else to say, other than that Pequod's is the best pan pizza I've ever had. The caramelized cheese around the crust, the sauce, the pepperoni - all absolutely fantastic!"
I have a new favorite deep dish pizza - Pequod's.  The crust adds so much flavor and enhances the pizza.  There isn't too much cheese or grease.  All of the ingredients are in perfect balance.
I have been going to Pequod's regularly now for almost 13 years and have nothing but good things to say about their pizza. I'm not sure in all of that time I have even tried anything there BUT their pizza! The thin is always great and the deep dish is fantastic. I liked the place better before they remodeled (it had more personality) but it's still nice to eat there. Hands down still the best pizza I've had in Chicago.
"I am not a Chicago native, and tend to waiver between thin and thick crust pizza depending on the day. One thing I can say about about Pequod's that makes it stand out from the crowd--their thick crust pizza has a ring of burnt cheese which is absolutely delicious, and unlike any other pizza. Also, their sign has a fish with a thong on his head. 4 stars for that alone.For an appetizer..try the fried zucchini!"
"Ok, the honest truth is that if I had a ""last meal"", this would be it...I love this place.  Best pizza in the city and I love bringing out of towners to this place as my little discovery...even though its hard to keep a lid on it these days as they are totally getting the recognition they deserve lately.  I love the good beer on tap and friendly atmosphere.  Please don't go here though-I don't want to wait so long for a table!"
Some real solid pizza and appetizers.  Like many I get the deep dish here because it has a one of a kind taste.  I have to be in the mood for the carmelized crust but when I am it always hits the stop.Classic joint with friendly service and some TVs to watch sports and such when games are on.
"Best deep dish in Chicago.  I'm eating the leftovers now and it tastes as good as it did in the store.  The crust is fantastic and while most deep dish tends to be extremely heavy, Pequod's feels light and doesn't weigh you down like Malnati's or Gino's.  I can't wait to go back."
"The FIRST place I stop when visiting from California.  This former Chicagoan gives it the title of ""Best Pizza on Earth!!!!"""
"I enjoy Pequod's more than Lou Malnati's, Gino's, Pizzeria Uno, and Giordano's (from a pizza & environment standpoint). I'm not a native Chicagoan, so that may be why but the thin crust, pepperoni & jalapeno is to die for here!"
Went here a couple nights ago and can't get that flaky burnt crust out of my dreams! It is the best piece of pizza I have had in the city of chicago. Anyone wishing to argue that clearly hasn't tried it yet.
Great thin or pan  pizza  The lunch special from 11-3 Mon to Fri is a fabulous deal. Less than $5 for a beer or soft drink and an individual pan pizza.
"Before I moved to Chicago, I had visited the city as a tourist and not knowing any better had waited in line for over 90 mins for pizza at UNO just off the mag mile. The pizza was good, but it isn't hard to find good pizza in Chicago. It isn't even difficult to find great pizza in Chicago. However, if you're looking for that slice made from flour,yeast, and god's breath, go to Pequod's. It all starts with the divine crust, the true foundation of any pizza. Theirs is deep dish, black around the edges, not burnt; caramelized. Yum, drool. They top it with super fresh veggies and meats. I'm fairly certain they make their own sausage, which is often the case with the best pizza houses. If you're finicky, you probably won't like this place. If you love exploring the best food, (not necessarily the most expensive or the most popular in your tour book) go here. If all this doesn't convince you, let me add that they usually have a good selection of local and/or craft beers on tap. Good beer and amazing pizza wins this girl's heart every time."
"I've been to Pequod's SO many times since we discovered it, it's ridiculous. We always get their deep dish pepperoni and every single time it's been delicious and perfect. I LOVE the caramelized cheese at the crust part. Not only is their pizza amazing, there is also something special about their Blue Moons on tap. I've tried other Blue Moons at various bars, but theirs is so tasty and rich (no clue why). You HAVE to try their Blue Moons. It can get pricey though (~$6/beer?). Writing this review makes me want to go there tonight...I just might..."
"This is easily the best pizza in the city.  From the caramelized crust, down to the sauce, it doesn't get any better.  Or does it???Oh yeah, $5 lunch special every week day: a personal pan pizza with one topping and one free fountain drink or Miller Lite.  I'm not a big fan of Miller Lite, but when I pay $5 for a pizza and a beer, it's hard to beat..."
I was there last night with a rather large group of people 20-25 and they were very accommodating. We had called in advance and they reserved this whole section for us. Their pan pizza was delicious and their staff was good.  Ps thier crust really is the deal! Pizza is a bit doughy but its still freaking good
"This is the first place I've ever had deep dish pizza from, so I have literally nothing else to compare it to, but I can honestly say that it's the best pizza I've ever had. The cheese on the edges is delicious and caramelized, the toppings were amazing (mushrooms, sausage, black olives), the cheese on top was perfect, and the whole thing was just delicious. I'm a pretty big guy and two slices off the media pizza had me stuffed, and that's even after I ate lightly all day in anticipation for this Chicago gem. The crust is also perfectly crispy, which is just how I like my pizza. Absolutely wonderful."
"Easily my favorite pizza in all of Chicago.  The bar is nice, and they have a great lunch special that includes a small pizza and a beer.  How can you beat that?  It is hard to get to by public transit, so I usually drive, and parking is ok in the area.  When I get it delivered, they usually arrive within an hour and the pizza is always still hot."
I've been living in the area near peaquod for about 6 months now. I am so glad that there is a good pizza place in walking distance. Peaquod's is my top two favorite pan pizzas. My roommates go there at least once a week! the staff is terrific and It's a good place to watch sports games while you eat!
"Visiting Chicago with my daughter, I decided we needed to try some authentic deep dish Chicago Pizza. Pequod's seemed like the best place, only a 15 minute cab ride from where we were, and a lot of Great reviews on Yelp.   We arrived about 6:15 on Tuesday 8-5-2014. Its a Bar/restaurant. We walked in and were taken upstairs immediatly. They only had two soups, so we both ordered the Mushroom soup. For pizza we ordered deep dish with extra cheese, mushrooms and pepperoni. The mushroom soup came very quickly. It was good, nothing to rave about. I've had better, but I've had a lot worse. The pizza took a little while to arrive, but our waitress warned us. If you are getting fresh, deep dish pizza, you should expect it to take a while. It arrived and it was good. Now I am a Big Fan of Deep dish pizza, so I have tried a lot. Pequod's pizza is very good, but again, nothing memorable. The crust was overly cooked, a bit too burned and crispy for my daughter and I. We have a pizzeria in the Detroit area called Pizza Papalis, that is my all time favorite. It takes almost an hour to get your pizza and its made with several kinds of cheese's and has a crust that you will swear, comes out of a bakery.Pizza Papalis is what I judge all other deep dish pizza by. Pure heaven!  I have to say Peguod's got an extra star from me for their incredible service. Three people ""tag teamed"" our table. Rushing over food, picking up and dropping off plates and refilling outr water glasses. Their service was exceptional. Got us in and out in a hurry, but we didn't feel rushed in the least. I would say Pequod's is worth a visit, if you want good pizza and Great service!"
I was a little worried about moving away from my traditional pizza joints when I ordered from Pequods the first time....but that quickly went away when i tasted my first bite of this most tasty treat!  I love the pizza here and it has quickly become my favorite in the city!  Nothing better than a pepperoni pan pizza with that delicious caramelized crust!!!!  MMMMM!
"Think thick crust with a layer of cheese, toppings, and sauce on top.  This is not like a Lou's or Uno's, but something a little different.  Great crust.  I read about the caramelized crust edges and I immediately became a fan.  We went early on a Saturday and were ushered up stairs.  The upstairs had all of the young families and was a bit loud with the kids running around.  I wish this place delivered to me."
"I think everything that has to be said about this pizza has already been said. But I'll say it again because why not? I love the taste of the caramelized crust. I love the sauce the cheese, etc. This is my favorite ""deep dish"" place in the city right now. But I am far from a pizza expert. I really enjoy that this pizza reheats well as most deep dish pizzas do but this one seems to reheat better than others. There's usually a good beer deal going on here while dining in. This is my pizza of first resort in the Lincoln Park area."
"I was a big fan when I first tried Pequod's!  The deep dish was delicious - buttery, crispy crust and the filling was tasty.  I was there for a work event so the service was on the slower side (probably a little understaffed).  I'm looking forward to trying out their lunch special - 7"" personal cheese pizza + 1 topping and choice of fountain soda or tap beer.  Not a bad deal!"
"The pan pizza is the best thick-crust pizza I have ever tried, bar none.  The broiled cheese crust in ingenious, and they apply no shortage of toppings.  All for a reasonable price.  Great atmosphere as well with TVs playing sports in just about every direction"
"if your looking for ""chicago deep dish"" pizza, look no farther! a lot of places claim to have the famous deep dish, but just add more cheese, or too much sauce.pequods is amazing. they don't skimp on toppings (order the sausage sometime, and it will be like patties on top), but they do know how to use the toppings so they don't overwhelm. they also allow you to call ahead, which is awesome because the place is usually packed. so by the time you find parking, and get a table, you pizza has arrived.if only i could figure out the story behind the whale with the thong on its head... this place would be 5/5 :)"
I looooooove Pequods!! We always order the New York style pepperoni (extra pepperoni please!!) and a salad with ranch....seriously the best pizza I've ever had! ;)
"Peqouds!  The dark horse of all the Deep Dish establishments.  I'm going to start taking my out-of-town friends here to show them an off-the-path local place.  A fantastic go-to restaurant, especially when paired up with a Kerasotes movie to follow.  Try deep dish with Pepperoni and Green Olives.  You'll thank me.I'm thinking about buying a Pequods thong for the lady... thoughts?"
"While the service may not be very friendly, the pizza is pretty darn good.  I was here for the first time about five years ago, and loved it.  I came here today with my parents, and had only one complaint outside of service.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but the pizza was lacking in sauce.  Instead of slathering sauce in between the ingredients, they simply drizzle it on the top.  This is good because the crust stays nice and crispy.  It was a quick fix, though.  We asked for some extra sauce, and the pizza was perfect.  Oh, and the best part is the ""caramelized cheese"" on the crust.  I am not sure how they do it, but they come so close to burning it, and stop just in time to make it deliciously savory!  Yummy."
"This is my favorite pizza place in the Chicago area. Exclamation mark!I'm a suburbanite, but I don't mind driving out to the city and waiting for a table to eat here. Speaking of which, if you come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to WAIT. So worth it though... Believe me. Nice thing is you can order your pizza when you put your name on the list for a table, and when you are seated you don't have to wait very long for your pizza. When I come here, I usually stick to 1 - 3 toppings max. The perfect pizza for me is pepperoni and maybe fresh basil. The cheese and caramelized crust is the star of the show, so I try and keep it simple as to not detract from that. One thing I don't get is the mascot? A whale with a thong on it's head??? No clue... Two of the servers I spoke with couldn't really explain it either. Seriously, if you haven't been checked out Pequods you are definitely missing out. Speaking of which, I should start planning my next trip out to this place :-)."
"Our favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago, especially with sausage. We go here every time we're in town."
"This was my first experience at Pequods with the Windy City Pizza Club. We sat upstairs which was semi busy. The atmosphere was nice, easy to hear the people next to you, but the lighting could have been a little better. The menu was not as big as I expected for this being a very well known pizza establishment. The pizza was very good, (I had a thin crust with vegetables) but the service was terrible. We ordered our food and after awhile we asked the waitress how much longer it would be till we were served. She went to go check and then told us that there was a mix-up in the kitchen and that we would have to wait a few more minutes... we were starving at this point so not words we wanted to hear. Overall, I would go back but maybe not at a busy time of the day."
"The deepdish pizza is quite good, and the place has a very fun atmosphere.  Perfect place for a group of friends to have beers and pizza and catch up on old times.  The pepperoni and the caramelized crust edges are VERY good.  However, the crust is too doughy, and they skimp on the sauce every time.   Upstairs is a bit quieter.  This location is totally different from the boring, grandmas-house Morton Grove location.  Prices on pizza are good."
"This place is ""legend""...wait for it...""dary"". I am a pizza enthusiast, and I can say without a doubt this is one of the best Pizza places our great city of Chicago has to offer.  The caramelized crust alone would get 3 stars by itself, add that to a delicious pizza and that makes 5 stars buddy!!!  My wife actually introduced me to this place back in the day...I think this is where we went on our second date...back to the point.  The pizza here is undeniably good, and is better than many of the more famous pizza places.  They also have pretty fast delivery from what I remember.  If you have friends or family visiting from out of town...take them here instead of the usual (Giordano's, Lou Malnattis, Gino's East...etc).  Guaranteed they will remember why Chicago is known for its deep dish pizza."
"Wow, probably the best pan pizza I've ever had bar none. From crust to the toppings, especially the sausage, it was great. There isn't much else I can add, the bar has a nice beer selection? I loved the pie, they had great sausage and it was hot when we got it. The waitress was solid, the prices acceptable and the restaurant good looking enough."
"Not much to say except it's the best deep dish pizza around. You have to order the pepperoni, the cheese is carmelized on top and the combo is fantastic. Don't bother with the thin crust, it's average at best."
"I love Pequod's.  Disclaimer giving  4 stars (instead of 5)  - I only ever get the pan pizza.I've been eating Pequod's for years and always love it.  Pan pizza w/ sausage, pan pizza w/ jalepenos, pan pizza plain = great.I do miss the old interior - but the pizza is still the same and that's great."
Best deep dish in the city and I don't even really like deep dish but this is great.
"Although the name is unusual, they have great pan pizza and a nice comfortable atmosphere. It is what you would expect when you think of a pizzeria. Allow 30 minutes for the pizza and then go see a movie across the street."
"My friend Tony took me to this place when we were in the area saying he goes there all the time for their lunch special. For the prize, the pizza was worth it. Sad to hear about the owner's daughter though. My condolences."
"I dream of this pizza, I salivate just thinking about it and want to run to the airport and jump on a plane.  Not just because my BFF Tami is there but because of Chicago's food.  It does take a while to cook an amazing pizza pie - so chill, watch some sports on the tube and drink a little bit.  My favorite pie has been mushrooms and black olives - the sauce has a strong tomato taste, but the best part is the crunchy crispy divine crust of cheese and crust that wraps your taste buds in a dance of dirty dancing!  I even purchased my own tank top and the cool thing about their logo is it has a whale that looks like a thong or under ware on top of its head - anyone know what that is?"
"My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago! It's so delicious that I always keep a few slices in my freezer, to be prepared for any late night pizza craving emergencies! The caramelized crust is amazing; toppings are fresh and go all the way to the edge of the pan, so you're not left with a giant hunk of plain crust at the end of your slice (a la Giordano's). A medium will feed 3 hungry people, and it's very reasonably priced for deep dish in the city."
"Even when they are busy, I dont care. Its worth it.  One of the best italian beefs I have ever had. The servers take some warming up (dealing with enough drunks with toughen anyone) but once they do they are great. All of the bartenders are super nice, I dont use servers there so I cant comment on that."
"This is the best pizza in Chicago no question.   It's a must that you have the fresh garlic on the pizza especially with onion and green pepper.  It can get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday from 7-11pm.  Draft beer selection is decent.  The quality of the pizza makes it good place to watch a game.  They have 2 stories with TV's on both.  Service is good.  If it's too busy on friday or saturday go next to Flounders, they will let you order pizza from Peqoud's as long as you order drinks.  They even have a server come over from Peqoud's to serve you.  Just a tip"
Not a bad place for pizza. The pizza is quite delicious. The atmosphere is nice too.
"I'm a fan of Pequod's -- this location as well as the one in Morton Grove -- but last time I ate pizza from here I was a teeny bit disappointed.  The carmelized crust can be amazing but sometimes (depending on how it's prepared? it just tastes burnt.  I like their deep dish and thin crust and I've had it a few times where it's been truly amazing. Last time, though, the cheese pizza I had totally tasted like cardboard.  So, I still recommend it but I'm a little less excited about it than I used to be."
"Pequod's Pizzeria has, hands down, the best deep-dish messiest pizza I've ever eaten!  I've always been a sucker for ""caramelized"" (burnt) cheese, and this place satisfies my craving!  Not too mention some of the freshest toppings, excellent sausage and pepperoni!"
"Period point blank, until they invent an alarm clock that wakes you up with a blowjob and a glass of jameson, this pizza will be the best thing ever."
"Seriously the best pizza I've found in Chicago yet. Both thin and deep dish are delicious, though I'm particularly partial to their thin crust, and I'm usually a deep dish/thick crust kind of girl. S'rsly.  I don't even need to say anything else. Good eats. Go eat."
"Being a born-and-bred Brooklyn Boy, I am supposed to hate deep dish pizza. I'm supposed to hate it like I hate the Red Sox & the Mets. That's just plain stupid. Pequod's is incredible. Sure, it takes about 30 minutes for the food to come, but it's damn good. It's thick, but loaded with toppings, not dough. We love to go and load that sucker up with 5 to 8 toppings and it's always great. get the garlic, it's not one you'd think of, but definitely worth it."
"This is the best pizza in the city!  Both their thin crust and deep dish are way above the competition.  I like to go with a group and order both kinds - because they are so different, but I can't decide which I like better.  The staff is friendly and the place is very inviting :) Being located right by the movie theater makes it the perfect stop for dinner and a movie!  If you haven't been there - make it a ""must do"" next time you are in the mood for pizza!  You won't be disappointed!"
I'm no fan of deep dish pizza but pequods is fucking amazing! Burnt cheese gets me hard.
"Great place for a bite to eat before a movie. The crubled sausage and basil deep dish pizza is AWESOME! Might be my favorite pizza joint in the city.If you are going to a movie however, do a pizza order call ahead, and when you check in, tell them you have a movie time--- otherwise, they don't put the pie in the oven until your table is ready!"
"The RedEye (yeah, I know) helpfully reports that Pequod's should be back in business this weekend.  Praise the pizza gods!"
"we get the pan pizza with pepperoni usually, and some pepperoncinis as well, try that out...good mozarella sticks and house salad as well. i enjoy this place."
"First of all, Pequod's serves the best pizza I've ever had- in Chicago or anywhere.  The caramelized crust (it's not burnt, people) on the deep dish pizza is what makes them unique so don't even think about ordering thin crust.  Also, if it is your first time, you'll want to go in and try it fresh, not delivered. It is worth pointing out that the Pequod's deep dish is different from other ""chicago-style"" pizza like Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's.  This isn't stuffed pizza, it is more traditional- but again, it's all about the crust.  For me, nothing beats the topping combination of pepperoni and pepperoncini.  They smother the pie with toppings so I don't recommend going crazy with a lot of different toppings.  The restaurant itself can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends.  If you have a large party, be sure to make a reservation.  You can also place your order while you wait since it takes about 30 minutes to cook. After you try Pequod's, you will probably never eat pizza anywhere else ever again."
"Pequod's deep dish pepperoni pizza pie with jalapeno's?  Hell to the yes!  I have tried deep dish at all the Lou Malginoseastgiordano's Uno and I am NOT a fan.  This deep dish was really tasty and the caramelized crust is arguably the best part of the pizza.  But the pepperoni is my first love; sliced thin and just a bit spicy, it wins my heart over."
"Chicago = Pizza and Pequod's is the top of the line in Chicago.  Cool atmosphere, nice bar and GREAT pizza."
"I really like this pizza.  The sauce is tasty and they always give you extra ingredients.  However, they tend to burn the pizza, which is not so tasty.  But 4 stars stay because they're Sox fans."
"The pan pizza and yummy, crazy caramelized crust....mmmmmmm, so good!  It takes a while for delivery, but I think it is worth the wait and the cash; it's a little pricey for some za.  Totally worth it!"
The best deep dish Chicago pizza hands down!!!  The cheesey carmalized crust is to die for.
"Probably the best deep dish in the city, the caramelized crust makes it that much more amazing.  I feel like it's always packed in there, so you have to be sure to make reservations, especially for a larger group.  They always have good beers on tap and the staff is always friendly."
"Caramelized cheese crust, so freakin good. My favorite pizza in Chicago - I recommend the deep dish with pepperoni and pepperoncini. Thin is still good, but the deep dish is what you need to get. Plus it's deep dish that isn't solid cheese (ie Gino's), so you're not quite as full after you eat it."
"If you're bored with Uno's/Due's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's, Edwardo's, etc. then I suggest going here.  Pequod's is excellent.  I like how there's so many opinions on what good Chicago pizza is.  Other smaller cities would be lucky to have this kind of debate."
"The very true test of a great pizza, like love,  is the morning after.  Pequod's gets my highest pizza rating and this ol' Taylor Street gal knows her pizza.   I thought it was one of the best ever and the crust was not only pretty but crunchy.  Whole family loved it - Don't know why we never tried it before as we pass by there all the time.  Thanks to the Pizza god above for my daughter's maturing taste buds, and delivering us from the evil taste of Domino's.  Amen."
"Unlike most of the reviews of this place, I am reviewing the thin crust pizza instead of the pan.  The thin crust is very good--not too crackery, with just the right bit of chewiness.  The toppings are yummy and plentiful, and the sausage and mushroom combo is my favorite.  What's weird though, is that Pequod's is the ONLY pizza I've ever eaten that I add salt to.  One would think that between the cheese, sausage, and pepperoni it would be almost too salty, but no!  Bizarre, but true for me every time I've had it."
"Yum, Yum, YUM! We've been here three times and can't wait to come back! The sauce is delicious and the caramilzed crust is unlike anything we've ever had....a must have while visiting the City!"
"Excellent pan-style pizza.  The crust really makes it, but all of it is top-notch.  That ring of burned cheese is tasty, though not mind-blowing by any means.  The sausage is very good, better than Malnati's.  Service was solid."
"I think I might have blown out a few taste buds because our pan pizza was so good.  Normally I am a lou malanati's girl but i think I might be swinging by this place more often.  If you are a sausage lover you will definitely enjoy their spicy chunks, they lay the toppings down heavy.  I love our server's reasoning for the whole pequods whale theme.  According to them ""the owner is a real scumbag and just wanted to put some pants on moby dick""  Now that's Chicago for you!"
"Yes, Pequod's you are awesome.No frills atmosphere, but the deep dish pizza with caramelized crust + giardiniera peppers is money, total F'ing money.To boot, they have a lunch deal that includes a personal sized pie + 1 beer or soda for $5 for dine in.Screw all the chains and their supposed best Chicago style deep dish.If you have not been here yet and call yourself a Chicagoan - I'd get here ASAP via your Cta Card/Igo/Car/Segway/Bicycle/Legs, now.Why are you still reading this - go."
"Their pizza is amazing, especially the caramelized crust.  Appetizers leave a little to be desired, mostly fried veggies with ranch.  Go for the pizza, stay for the pitchers of beer."
Amazing!!!!  The pictures on the site make me want to order it now. Best deep dish in the city!
"This was one of the first pizza places that I came to when I moved to Chicago. I was on my search for ""the best Chicago style pizza."" I have to admit, I realized that I really don't like the deep dish Chicago style but Pequod's is different. It is a deep pan pizza with a caramelized/burnt crust which is something to crave. So it is really much better than traditional Chicago style, but just as filling. I can only finish one slice here and then i get sleepy. But if you haven't tried this place- you should. You can order it and pick it up or go in to a dive-type atmosphere."
"I made it a gastronomic goal to eat in every pizzeria that was touted by Chicago mag, the Reader, RedEye , etc because i love pizza and it's a popular way to end a movie outing.  And Pequod's is across the street from Webster Place Theatre ... so.  it is very unique, crusty, tasty, reasonably priced, fast from the oven and it does warm up in a microwave like no other pizza.  What else could a pizza afficionado want? i gave it five stars for the food - i'm not into the sports bar atmosphere, but the Sunday we went there was a game on and the volume was low enough for conversation and enthusiastic fans were even polite."
"YUM YUM YUM!!! I don't typically prefer deep dish pizza, but this pizzza is GREAT!!! We tend to normally call in an order on our way home from a bar on Friday night. Delicious, and even better the next morning after you've popped it in the oven for a few minutes!!"
"Last night I went to another establishment for deep dish pizza and all I could do is compare it to Peaquod's. Seriously folks, this is the best pizza in Chicago- hands down!!"
"Still the best pizza I've ever had!  Just went back for the 1st time since they re-opened and it was worth the wait.  The three things that make Pequod's stand out to me are:  1) the carmelized crust, 2) the fact that they never skimp on the toppings, and 3) this pizza tastes just as good the next day.  The new renovations to the interior look great.  Can't wait to go back!"
"Ok I must nerdily admit my favorite memory of Pequods was buying a pizza while me a friend were waiting in line to see the last Star Wars movie across the street.  I brought the pie back and everybody in line was instantly jealous.  We shared some of the pizza to pretty girls that asked for it.. yes we are horrible people.  But at least I didn't resort to using a dog.  Well at any rate.  Pequods thin crust is decent to good.  Pequod's pan pizza, is actually what you want.  They do a good job with the ingredients, sauce is good.  Its worth the wait, very good pizza and a very nice bar to catch a drink in.  The pizza is unique as the caremalize (burn) some cheese on the edges of all their pies, some people don't like this, but I don't mind.  Eating in can get very busy and I have never lived close enough for delivery, so can't comment on that."
"I've never actually been to the restuarant but have gotten pizza delivered from here many times.  This is a review strictly of the pizza and not the restuarant/service.This pizza ties with Lou Maltnati's as best pizza in Chicago! (IMHO at least). The crust is thick and soft, and carmelized with cheese around the outside. Peperoni has a nice flavor (peperoni and onion toppings are highly recommended).  The pizza is very filling- I can eat 2 pieces if I'm absolulety starving.  However, as far as re-heating the next day, this pizza tastes the best, hands down. Crust and cheese holds up well, and it just tastes great."
"Yeah, the pizza is amazing. I used to drive up from Hyde Park to get a pie on the weekends."
"One of my favorites in Chicago. You can't beat the deep dish (love that crust), and the thin is killer too. Great beer selection and good service."
"This pizza is one of my favorite's in the city. And that says alot considering Chicago is known for pizza. The crust is magnificent...buttery, soft, and crispy at the same time. It comes out piping hot. Add a cold beer with good pizza and you can't go wrong. I like to stop here before catching a show at the Webster Place theater across the street. Great spot if the Cubs are playing too since the games are always on."
"Great stuff. I love UNO, Lou's, Gino's too. I'm a sucker for excellent pizza and this is one of those places. However, Pequod's has better service than those other places"
"I am a thin crust kind of girl, but I must admit this is the best deep dish pizza I have ever had.  Not just in Chicago but anywhere.  My parents are the same way and when i took them there while they were in town, my mom was not even going to try it.  However, when I told her about the yummy burnt cheese on the crust she was all over it.it takes a little while to get your food, but it is worth the wait.  The pizza comes out hot and fresh.Overall a great place and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"i was recently introduced to pequod's last year by a co-worker and i boy am i thankful. i always get the pan pizza which comes with a carmelized crust. HEAVEN! it's a little more puffy/doughy than you might expect, but they don't get cheap on the toppings. with pan pizza as good as this, who needs deep dish?"
"The Good: -The absolute BEST deep dish pizza I have EVER had! -Great service (waiters/waitresses are fun and friendly)-Recommended by more Chicagoans I know than any other place when asked where to go for the BEST pizzaThe Bad: -NoneThe Ugly:-Friend told me he had food poisoning from them once, to give you an idea of how good the pizza is, he still goes there regularly!"
"There is deep dish pizza, and well there is Pequods.  I love this pizza.  I usually get a sausage and mushroom deep dish.  The trademark of a Pequods pizza is the carmelized crust.  I absolutely love it and this place is my first and foremost recommendation to all visitors to Chicago.  Now there is plenty of pizza to choose from but the combination of sauce, great tasting sausage, and carmelized crust makes this one of the many reasons I miss Chicago."
"i use to say that lou malnatti's was the only acceptable deep dish in chicago...but pequod's has trumped that.i'm not a deep dish fan. i think giordano's and gino's east is all bread and a choking hazard waiting to happen. but pequod's and lou's changed my mind on that front...helping me realize that there are some redeemable qualities for deep dish. pequod's is crispy as hell...almost burnt, but not. buttery and not too doughy. it's a lil dive, just the kind of chi spots i love and right across the street from the webster movie theater if you wanna do dinner and movie."
"My friend and I walked in around 7:30 on a Tuesday and Pequod's was really busy...luckily we snagged the last open table. The waitresses and owner were running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to deliver perfect service. In that quest, the owner yelled multiple times at our waitress and we felt bad, because she was obviously busting her butt trying to get to all her tables...that's my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. We actually didn't have pizza, so I'll have to go back soon.  I had ravioli and it was great. My friend had some sort of sandwich...I don't remember what it was, but he loved it. Even though it was busy, we never felt rushed. I'm excited to go back and try the pizza next time."
Delicious and tasty deep dish pizza. Great ambience. Attentive service.
"I went to Chicago with my girlfriend over Memorial Day Weekend, and she had a tour book that recommended three different Chicago-style pizza places.  Those recommendations were Giordano's (the guide book's favorite), Gino's East, and Pequod's.  The one we didn't try was Giordano's, so I am eagerly looking forward to visiting Chicago again to try it, because if it's better than Pequod's, I may just move there.Since this is a review about Pequod's, maybe I should mention it.  It was outstanding.  Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I've gotten used to Zachary's Chicago style pizza in Berkeley.  While Gino's East was different but ultimately a notch below Zachary's, Pequod's stood right up to it.  The caramelized cheese was great, the sauce was delicious...  I've been thinking about that place for two solid months since leaving.  I'm desperately thinking of a reason to return to Chicago, just so I can get some more Pequod's.  And I'm definitely buying a T-shirt next time, just so I can advertise for them out in CA.  This may be blasphemous, but if they opened up one in the Bay Area, there's an outside chance I would never eat Zachary's again."
"This pizza was amazing! We had to take a taxi to get here, but it was worth it! The sausage is amazing. The crust taste a bit burnt, but in a good way. The sauce is terrific. It was even good leftover and cold; I don't usually like cold pizza. I did my homework before heading to Chicago and read this place was as good as it gets. I have to agree, the pizza at the other places was good too, but the sausage put this place over the top! I should note I am not normally a sausage pizza fan, but this sausage pizza is wonderful!"
"In my opinion this is probably the best pizza in Chicago. The caramelized cheese around the edges is something I haven't found anywhere else. It's also right across the street from the movie theater on Webster so it's a great place to eat before or after a movie. They just renovated the place and it's a lot brighter than before, which is not necessarily a good thing, but overall the new set up woks better."
"Pequod's does a nice job of making a pie that is half way between a deep and pan pizza.  Its not too cheesy and not too crusty...its just perfect.  Though I will say, its much better at the restaurant.  Its good when delivered, but better pipping hot in the pizza dish.  The restaurant itself could use a makeover, but I suppose that's not the reason to go there.  I really enjoy thin crust, but when I want to go deep, this is where I go."
"Being from Boston, I've always loved New York style (thin) pizza... But this is BY FAR my favorite pizza EVER. I LOVE THIS STUFF. I tend to get just extra cheese on mine, because I feel that any additional toppings take away from the buttery, YUMMY crust. And the burnt cheese, MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. I can't say enough about this pizza, it's delish! ;o)"
"Pequod's is stellar pizza, and an excellent deal.  I mean you get a huge personal deep dish pizza with one topping and a draft beer, yes, a beer, during lunch hours for $5.  That's absurd.  The pizza is legit, the scene is legit, and I quickly became a regular here during lunch hours (and had to walk a mile and a half each way to get here).  I miss you Pequod's."
"Go Monday through Thursday, and you will not be disappointed.  The pizza may be the best in the city.  If you want it on the weekends, consider getting it as pickup/to go unless you have time to wait in line.  :)"
"best deep dish in chicago.  period.  if i were a rich man, when i when to pequods i would order a large pepperoni with onion, and then just eat the outside 1"".  that caramelized crust is the best.  and the giant sausage chunks are pretty damn good too.  yeah sure, even every once in a while you get just an ok pizza.  and it's not a dive like it was 5 years ago.  and sure, it takes 45 minutes per pizza.  and the lines are long.  but it's worth it.  i will go to the grave defending pequods as the best deep dish in chicago.  get take out or delivery if you must, but it's never the same as in the store.  and enjoy!"
"I'm down.  Good, cheap pizza that had me tokin' the pepto for the next 6 hours (that's how you know there were enough tomatoes, garlic, and cheese)."
Good deep dish pizza and service.  The plain pie had a good sauce and flavor toppings like sausage are definitely the way to go.
"I came here on a Sunday evening  to try the famous carmelized crust. Because I arrived at an off-peak hour (5pm) and was with only one other person, we were seated right away without reservations on the second floor. I prepared myself for a long wait, so my dining companion and I ordered some Goose Island and jalepeno poppers to pass the time. The poppers were pretty good. They were filled with cheddar cheese, and although I prefer the cream cheese jalepeno poppers, these were hot and cheesy and fried and really, what more could you ask for?Our spinach and garlic deep dish arrived about 45 minutes later. We decided to go with spinach and garlic to compare it to Giordano's, whose spinach and garlic pizza is out of this world. This pizza was also excellent. The actual cheesy-garlicky-spinach part of the pizza probably wasn't as good as giardano's because the amount of toppings was kind of weak, but this is not to say that it was bad. It was still delicious. The crust, of course, was insanely good. Chewy, crispy, doughy- all at the same time. How is this even possible? One of life's great mysteries. Make your life easier by anticipating the long wait for the pizza and avoid waiting for a table by making reservations or going at an off hour. Enjoy some beer while you wait, and then dive into some incredibile chicago-style deep dish!"
"Caramelized cheese crust, need I say more! Every time I come to Chicago I make sure to eat at Pequods. My favorite is sausage, bell peppers and onion. The sausage is excellent! Service is sub par, but its a pizza place, what can you expect"
"I *love* this pizza place :) I don't like deep dish pizza (the roomie raves about it though) but the pan is my favorite (we took turns ordering it). I ate it every week during football season. I'm from Ohio and it reminds me of my favorite pizza back home. The crust is good, the sauce is good (not too much, not too little) and the toppings are great (we usually get pepperoni and/or sausage ~ boring but I love it that way!) We got it to go (I live right up the street on Webster) but the few times I've eaten in, the service was decent.  The appetizers and salad are also good but I didn't care for the pasta dishes."
"Thank god there's a place in the land of deep dish where I can get a normal slice of pizza.  I love that you can customize by the slice.   So many options, too!  Great, friendly staff.  Not to mention the logo is a whale with a thong on its head."
If you're reading this it's because you're looking for the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.  You found it.  Now turn off your computer and go enjoy it.
"Ordered a deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and onions.  This pie was OUTSTANDING.  The big chunks of sausage and thick slices of pepperoni were really delicious.  The gooey cheesey crust was great was well. Delivery was on-time.  Price was a little stiff at $28 for a large three topping.  I only wish they would have been as generous with the onions as they were with the pepperoni."
"Was fortunate to visit the Morton Grove location.  Definitely a hole in the wall pizzeria!  Loud music, awesome waiter, awesome food!  Had a deep dish pizza - the cheese caramelized to perfection - sweetness of the dough - it made my visit awesome!  Looking for Chicago style pizza? Pequod's gets my vote!"
"if i want non-thin crust pizza, i prefer pequods over everything. their pan/deep dish is so good, i often eat too much and have to sit around for a while before i am able to move again. if i die from eating pizza (god willing), i hope there's a slice of this stuff hanging out of my mouth.it's a little expensive unless you have a larger group. their beer prices are atrocious, but i don't want to fill up on drinks so i usually just get water. i've never had to wait for a table because the have two floors of seating, but i have had to wait longer than i'd like to actually get my pizza. the wait staff is nice and, and i like that they serve everyone their first piece when they bring it out.i've shared a lot of good memories with friends and family at pequods, and when someone comes in from out of town, this is often a first choice for dinner. there's not much else to say except that if you love pizza, you'll love pequods."
"My new favorite deep dish in the city, and my husband has started requesting it on a weekly basis.  There's nothing remarkable about the thin crust, but the deep dish is the perfect cheese/sauce/crust combo.  The french fries were also lacking so I had to deduct a star, because fries and pizza are my favorite combination.  But, it's nice to be able to get a table at a decent time without having to wait.  Service is average but we'll come back anyways - the pizza IS that good, and yes, you should try it."
"I adore the carmelized crust pizza!   Usually we get it delivered but decided to go on a Saturday night after a movie at Webster place.  We almost didnt go in because the place looked so small and crowded, with people sitting outside on benches.. we thought the wait would be long.  DONT LET THE APPEARANCE OF A CROWD DISSUADE YOU.  We walked up to the hostess who promptly whisked us off to a table upstairs in a second, enourmous dining room.  The place is seriously huge."
"Pequod's is amazing! My honey took me here when I was pregnant...needless to say, he made many more trips within that nine months! I am a fan for life...the caramelized crust is divine!!! I would recommend it to anyone who wants amazingly delicious pizza...hands down the best I've tasted in chi-town! matter of fact I think I'll call them on my way home and have some pizza for dinner..yum!"
"Deliscious! I think this is quite possible my new favorite Chicago pizza. If I ever have to eat pizza elsewhere, I think I will be cheating on it and thinkin of Pequods. :)"
"I'm surprised this doesn't have five stars! It's the best pan pizza in the city! More dough, less sauce than most others, but that's why I like it. The carmelized crust makes it the most unique in the city. Start with the jalapeno poppers. Finish with pan pepperoni. And you'll go home a VERY happy person!"
Pizza...... Yummy and the Italian Beef on garlic bread and cheese....uh very yummy!!!
Enjoyed some good cheer and grub here! We came here right after our movie at Webster Place. Good Italian Beef and I hear the pizza is yummy too. Gotta check back here and have some more taste tests and some beer. Good service and nice atmosphere for a pizzeria!! mmm
"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is 10 times better than Gino's, 5 times better that Giordano's and just a tid bit better than Lou Malnati's.  If you want good deep dish come here, it is awesome and the crust is just a little burnt to perfectness.  I will be coming here from now on for my pizza needs, which mean a lot.  It also has a better atmosphere than the other pizza joints (Lou's in Lincoln Park feels like a basement), which makes it only even better.  GREAT PIZZA!"
had a nice pan pizza and bottle of chimay here about a week ago. service was good and the pizza was great!
Best Pizza in Chicago.  Nuff Said.
"Amazing pizza, hands down.  Puts Giordano's, Gino's East, etc. to shame."
best pizza ive probably ever had.  havent had deep dish in a while as i preferred thin crust but this one was amazing.  actually isnt too heavy for a deep dish.  great crust and love the caramalized end of the crust.  its like heaven.  im pretty simple when it comes to pizza....either plain cheese or just topped with jalepeno peppers so i didnt try any of the specialty pizzas.  definitely will be back over and over again.  also a great place to watch the games.
"I do not like Chicago pizza.  But I very much like Pequods.  The crust, the burnt cheese, and everything everyone else said.  Go."
Some of my favorite pizza in Chicago- Crispy crust without the mushy insides. I passed by and it seems like they are under renovation and will open up again soon with prices from the 1930's or something like that. It has a lively atmosphere and is a fun place to meet up.
Best 'Deep Dish' the city has to offer!  This place recently underwent remolding and it seriously cannot get any better! The appetizers are mouth watering and the pizza is amazing! I recommend this place over any other pizzeria in the city! Pequod's Pizzeria = happy stomachs!
"This is my favorite pizza in Chicago, but I agree with a few of the other reviews that say it can be inconsistent. I do absolutely love the $4.95 personal pan pizza and drink lunch special, it is a great deal and you can even call ahead your order if you are in a hurry!"
I'd have to say Pequod's is my favorite pizza with their carmelized cheese.  Both their thin and deep dish pizzas are HIGHLY enjoyable.
"Don't go to Peqoud's for anything besides great pizza or you'll probably be disappointed.  The atmosphere is your typical 'pizza joint', nothing special, and the salad and garlic cheese bread were both pretty lackluster BUT their pan pizza is awesome and incredibly filling.  It's a great place to grab a cheap dinner and then head across the street to a movie!"
"First off, I am a huge fan of the pan pizza. Carmelized cheese is a quick route to my heart. The service can be variable, but is mostly attentive and friendly, and perpetrated by a host of cleverly t-shirted hipster kids (as opposed to the moneyed, less-tattooed and more brand-conscious older variety). I am a sucker for anywhere that can simultaneously provide me with a personal size pan pizza & a beer, as well as recall shined-up, halcyon-days memories of my own collegiate pizza-joint-working past -- for less than five bucks. And it's close to my house. A good option before or after a flick at Webster Place."
"I really wanted to like this pizza, especially after all the glowing reviews. And for the most part I did, but I had one problem with my pizza. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, and the pie was covered with so many pepperoni that I thought I had ordered a ""pepperoni lovers"". Why complain? Well, I tend to enjoy my pepperoni cooked into the cheese as oppose to the pepperoni thrown on top merely as another topping. And because there was so much pepperoni the pizza had a very salty taste. So why am I giving this 4 stars? Because when I took off the pepperoni this was one heck of a pizza! Next time I order from Pequod's, I'm getting the cheese or sausage pizza. (I should also mention that Pequod's has a great relaxed atmosphere with a good staff.)"
"i was beginning to think that perhaps i just don't like deep dish pizza, but after a friend raved about this place, i had to give it a try, especially since it's within walking distance of home. they load their pizzas with toppings, which is a plus in my book. i had a pizza with mushrooms, black olives & large chunks of sausage and found it quite tasty. i don't usually like burnt food, and the cheese on the crust does look burnt, but it was the most flavorful part of the pizza. the tomato sauce could use more seasoning, but overall better than uno or giordano's. i can't say i fully recommend the fried shrooms. they were standard fare, and though they weren't greasy, the mushrooms inside seemed a bit too juicy and bland. the service was friendly and fast though i think the place gets more crowded on the weekend. i'll be back or order delivery when i need a pizza fix."
Great pizza! Been here twice. Had the thin crust the first time and the deep dish the second time. I was very happy both times! The restaurant is very narrow and there are not a ton of tables. Would not recommend this place for a romantic date but a great place to go for good pizza and a a couple of beers. The service was friendly and fast.
"I know there are 144 reviews for this place and while I just skimmed through them, they are mostly positive. I agree, this is damn good pizza, but I wanted to add my two cents by saying, DO NOT get this pizza delivered. Dine in! Some pizzas were not meant to be delivered and this is one of them. I know that the wait here can be long and it's loud, but its worth it to dine in despite the wait."
"If you like your pizza greasy and thick and meaty, you will be in heaven. Otherwise, it may not be for you. Check out their lunch specials- they're a steal!"
"Forget Gino's and forget Giordano's.  If you want the best Chicago pizza, go to Pequod's.  It's not in the Loop or the shopping district so it gets no love, but the tourists are just missing out.Went w/ my girlfriend for dinner and I had pizza leftovers for days.  Highly recommended!"
"Hockey will always be on, beer will be flowing, and great pizza will be baking..."
"This is by far my #1 deep dish pizza for Chicago as of yet.... Sauce Is sweet and tangy, crust is crisp and buttery, and there signature..the carmelized cheese crust...is sex in your mouth."
"Burnt cheese ... ton's of toppings.Very, very, very good pizza."
This is the best chicago pizza on the North Side. The thin crust is the best and the pan is good as well. The people in here are always so nice and the service is great. I always call ahead and preorder my pizza so it is ready when I get there. Plus the fried zucchini is great as well.
just got a pepperoni and sausage pizza last weekend - cant beat it! usually order it extra well done so thick crust is nice and crisp.
"If you like deep dish pizza but hate how heavy it is, then you should try this place. Their pizza is similar to deep dish but its not nearly as heavy, and the sauce they use is the best I've tasted! Its one of the best pizza places in the city (I'm a NY style pizza fan) but its definitely worth going to."
The best pizza in the city! I take all out-of-town guests to Pequod's to taste the best Chicago deep dish pizza. One of the major downfalls of living in the South Loop is being out of delivery range of Pequod's.
"Nice pizza, nice people. I wonder if reviews are necessary after 100 have been drafted. It is a nice palce for a bear and a slice!You can get by here for less than $10/person, but not with drinks."
"Went here for the first time on Saturday. I really liked the place -- nice atmosphere, laid back, and not too big. The pizza was delicious and their ""caramelized crust"" was pretty neat. Prices were good, too."
"I loved the carmalized crust and amount of tomato sauce. Been here 2 times, both times have enjoyed my dinner. Fun atmosphere. Good to hang out with friends have a few beers and have some really good pizza."
"The few times I've had Pequod's pizza, I've been drunk.  Very drunk.  As anyone who has been drunk before knows, alcohol makes everything taste at least 22% more delicious.  This makes Pequod's pizza 122% delicious.  VERY good stuff.  It looks a little offputting.  I mean, let's call a spade a spade.  It's burnt.  That burnt cheese is actually made of baby kittens and angels and cotton candy though, and will be some of the most beautiful stuff ever to enter your mouth.  Insert joke here."
"Yeah, it's a good life, you know? Swinging into Pequod's on a Friday afternoon and ordering their $5 lunch special can make anyone feel great about what's coming up and what's already occurred. What is the lunch special, you wonder, merely the incredible deal of a personal Chicago style deep dish and a beer. Seriously, at this price you can ""splurge"" on any of the fantastic appetizers (the garlic bread and mozzarella stick come highly recommended,) and still feel guilty about not having paid full price for a full stomach and a knowing satisfaction that is worth every penny.With the Webster Place theatre across the street, Pequod's also makes a perfect place for dinner dates and if a full sized Chicago deep dish is too daunting the calorically challenged will be thrilled to know that the thin crust pizza is also incredible. In any case the multitude of toppings and perfectly heated ovens almost make the crust moot, as you'll be getting a great pizza no matter what you go with."
"This is by far my favorite pizza place in the city!  The pan is delicious!  It is similar to a deep dish, but, IMO even better.  The crust is doughy and crunch all at the same time, and the top of the crust is caramelized in some wonderfully delicious fashion.  Don't even get me started on the toppings!  They put so many toppings on there it puts Giordano's to shame.  We had a pepperoni, mushroom, and green pepper pizza and you couldn't even see the cheese, there were so many toppings!  The pepperoni was also some of the best pepperoni I have had--very flavorful!  I highly recommend this place!"
Favorite pizza joint in the city!  The carmalized crust has won me over.   If you work or live around the area you can't beat their weekday lunch special: $5.00 for personal size pizza and a beer.
This place is awesome and cheap. It might even be better than Girodano's....there I said it. It doesn't get much better then this place. Believe me...I know my pizza. Parking isn't too bad if you go on a weeknight. I've never been on the weekend so not sure about the parking then. The staff was pretty nice too. They let us order our pizza and while we waited go to the bar next door and drink. My kind of place.
"This place gets 5 stars for a variety of reasons. Number one- although the place was an absolute madhouse on Friday night, the guy working on seating people remained calm and pleasant. Number two, they only had (maybe only have) one register, but the bartender kept my beers flowing and change coming...This place was very similar to a sauna on Friday night. It was uncomfortably hot, but you new the result would be positive. We waited, probably the longest I have ever waited for a table but I really didn't care. It was shocking that beer were $6 though...annoying too.The pizza was awesome. There was not too much breading, there was not too much sauce and there was a good amount of toppings along with it. Whatever they do with the crust is genius. This definitely sets this place apart from other deep dish places. I will definitely be back, preferably on a slower night; they carry-out as well. The menu is limited, but I don't see why anyone else would go here but for pizza. Be prepared to WAIT, even with a reservation. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable night out, this is not the place. I can't imagine how hot it gets in this place in the summer..."
"Had the most amazing deep dish pizza there. Went there a week or so ago when I was friend in town visiting from out of town. We went there like mid-afternoon and by the time we left around 3ish, the place was packed on a Saturday. Maybe everyone eating there was hungover from the night before and was eating a late lunch? Not sure. Anyway....my friend lived here for 5 yrs before moving out west. When I asked her what she wanted to do when she was here, she had go to Pequod's pizza on her to do list. Seriously. it was one of the 2 serious things she had planned. I had only been to this place maybe like 4-5 years ago on a date. The pizza was good, but the date was bad. And I only had the thin crust. This time 3 of us ordered a medium I think,. which was six pieces in total. We got sausage and green pepper. It was AMAZINGLY good. We all ate a piece there and then took a piece home with us to eat for lunch the next day. Would totally recommend it to anyone who wants real Chicago pizza."
"Great pizza, unique crust.  Regarding the 'mysterious' whale mascot, just read ""Moby Dick.""  The namesake Pequod was Ahab's whaling ship the Melville novel.  You're on your own with the panties, however...I have no idea."
"my favorite pizza delivery spot in chicago, beware if you don't like a really thick crust - you may not be as huge of a fan."
"By far, my favorite pizza in the city! The crust is delicious (especially with a side of their ranch dressing) and the toppings are equally yummy. I'm partial to the pepperoni but I've had other toppings and they've all been great. The service is overall as friendly and efficient as you're going to find for a pizza place that's as busy as it is. If you haven't tried this yet, go for it!"
I really have nothing to add.  This is the best pizza in Chicago.
their lunch spesh IS awesome.  you can't beat a five-dolla-make-you-holla pizza (plus soft drink of choice).  i ated the whole thang.  it was really yummy and hit the spot.
the greatest pizza on the planet.  forever and ever.  amen.
"Hands down my favorite deep dish pizza in all of Chicago. You will never know how good burnt cheese is until you eat here. Service is sometimes slow and I've always joked that some of the waitstaff acts like it's an honor that they are even bothering to serve you but you know what? I really don't care. They get the pizza to your table, that's all I need. The pizza makes up for any bad service...heck, this place could be on fire and I'd still come in and order one more pizza."
I loved Pequod's!  I like Deep Dish but every once in a while I don't want it!  Now I have found the better half! The thin crust is not TOO thin. Which I love. Filled with pepperoni & pepperocini's YUM! I will definitely be back and will be ordering in!
I've been coming to Pequods for over 10 years! This place has changed it's decor a lot since then. My bf swears this is his favorite pizza place. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni but theirs tastes almost like bacon because it's so crisp! Their caramelized crust is one of a kind and I haven't seen this at any other pizzeria! They have carry out and delivery which makes eating this pizza good anywhere!
I can honestly say this is the only good pizza I have had since moving to the midwest (6 yrs.) As everyone has pointed out the crust is the dealbreaker.
a buddy of mine said that this is his favorite deep dish... although i think lou's has a slight edge... i didn't have much to disagree with him. like many others... the crust is what makes this pizza. it's carmelized.. not burnt. the combination of the crispy crust and the loads of toppings = good shiz.
"This is my all-time favorite pizza!  It is deep, but not quite as deep as Giordano's.  It has less cheese than traditional deep dish, which is a nice change of pace.  The best part is the crunchy, crispy crust that is carmelized!  I recommend eating-in as the crust loses some crunchiness in delivery."
"Great pizza - never dined in, but always get it delivered.  You want toppings?  This place is probably king for toppings because its toppings overload, but that's a good thing.  If you want sausage, I think you can order the wheel of meat (layer of meat), or have it crumpled.  I've always have either the pepperoni only (a couple of co-workers are touchy like that) or the SMOG, which is the Morton Grove location's abbreviation of Sausage, Mushroom, Onions, and Green peppers.Compares nicely with Lou Malnati's and Gino's East as far as deep dish pizza is concerned, but still hold its own as being unique, so I can't say its better or worse than, say, Lou's.Otherwise, the pizza is such that you can get full from one or two pieces, regardless of size of the pie, and the taste is grand with the pizza sauce, cheese, crust, and the purposely burnt edges which is cheese - don't like the burnt cheese, take it off.Delivery is almost always good, as they will get it to you within 60-90 minutes; such is deep dish pizza for the long times but worth it.People taking your order is pleasant to deal with, though the web site is a bit spartan.Recommended for pizza lovers!Oh yeah, this location has been renovated from a fire, so it should be nice and up for business already."
"good pizza! good atmosphere! ive tried the 'famous' deep dish with caramelized cheesey crust stuff... some of the best deep dish ive had! (im not a 100% fan of deep dish...)the restaurant from the outside looks a little iffy, but inside is clean, updated, cozy... and buzzing with a crowd of down to earth people.  the wait staff is friendly and quick, apps are good, and prices are exactly what you want to pay when going out for pizza.going here is very comfortable and relaxed. and then you get GOOD PIZZA!thin looked good too... thats next weekend's dinner."
"The pizza is delicious. I got a pan pepperoni. The breaded mushrooms were probably the best I've had. The employees are friendly and attentive (there's like 5,000 of them). I can't think of any reason to give Pequod's lower than a 5!"
Pizza is great...I just don't care for the actual restaurant. Its alright. The service is good.
This place has great thin and deep pan pizza.  Also a great spot to watch sporting events.  i also like them cause they will deliver to me.
"I wish there were more stars. I have been eating pizza my whole life and I thought I had pretty much had it all. Pequod's blew my mind. The sausage! The carmelized onions! The size! I surrender to your gooey goodness! Sadly I no longer live in Chicago. But rarely does a day pass when I don't think about Pequod's. I shall return, and when I do. It's on. Big fan."
"YUM! It hardly needs repeating but the pizza is awesome.  The lunch special is extremely affordable, but so much food!"
"While the Morton Grove location has more character (more mom and pop feel), the pizza is still the same.  Great place and good atmosphere. (they renovated a few years ago so it is now filled with plasma tvs).  The pizza is excellent.  We always get the deep dish sausage, green pepper, and onion and are never disappointed.  Make sure you try the crust.  It may look burnt, but it is really just carmelized cheese.  It is in a good location so you could catch a movie at Webster just before or after since the theatre is right across the street.  I highly recommend!"
"Pequod's is no doubt my FAVORITE pizza in Chicago.  Especially when I'm in the mood for a thin pepperoni...theirs can't be beat.  And, they have a great beer selection too!"
Best Pizza in Chicago hands down...their house salad also has an awesome dressing.  Check out their lunch deal on weekdays...amazing bargain...just 4.95 for a personal pizza and a beer!
"I order here about 3 times a week. The best deep-dish pizza I've had in Chicago. Nothing else on the menu lives up to how good the pizza is, so just get the pizza and enjoy!"
Oh Pequod's...I won't care what you are doing to my arteries if you keep treating my stomach this way.  OM NOM NOM.
I don't know what they do but the crust is magic.  Magic I tell you.
"Best pizza EVER!! Pan pizza w/ pepperoni, mushrooms and garlic is the way to go. Super friendly staff, cool vibe and delicious pizza!"
"Simply the BEST Chicago Pizza---It does not get any better than this. UPDATE: The Staff is very rude and if your just are looking at the food, it gets all 5 stars. My advice: Delivery"
Awesome pizza...good atmosphere...love it...period
"One of the better Chicago style restaurants in the city!  Great place on the North Side, was really cool and punk before the fire and they did the remodeling.  Now the decor is slightly cookie-cutter/yuppie but the pizza and wait staff still ROCK!"
"I have never eaten AT Pequods only ordered out.  I would have to say hands down this is the best deep dish pizza in chicago.  The sauce is perfect and the crust is to die for.  Usually when you eat a deep dish pizza the crust at the end is this flaky cookie like substance that tastes OK but is not as good as the rest of the pizza.  Pequods carmalizes their crust and has the deep dish meat of the center of the pizza go all the way to the end.  You get a carmalized sweet treat.  How often would you say that the crust is the best part of the pizza, when the pizza is already good?"
"Loving the thin crust, but very upset that the thick is now mostly bread with very little sauce and cheese! What the hell happened? the carmelized crust is like crack cocaine - you will do anything (snow, sleet, or rain) to get there to get your fix! service is great - love hearing Foreigner and Journey blasting :)"
O.K.  This is one of those Chicago spots you must try.  It is not about the service or the atmosphere.  The pizza is the best in the city.  Hands down.  Four of us went to lunch for 33 bucks plus tip.  We each had a  personal deep dish and a drink.  It was so reasonable I thought it could have been a mistake.   We called ahead of time to place our order.  Our pizza was on the table five minutes after we sat.  If you think the pizza is burned you really do not know food and do not get the concept.  If you bothered to eat the caramelized  crust you would taste the light sweetness and great texture it brings.  Keep up the great work.
"I had a hankering for a pizzeria with a pan pizza with caramelized cheese all the way to the edges of the pan, fresh toppings, a great beer list and a friendly atmosphere. I had heard of Pequod's and their infamous pizza so I made the trek down to Webster Ave. to indulge. I ordered a Belgium-style beer and they informed my that I get a free pint glass with it that evening. Nice. I don't remember the beer (I think from Goose Island or New Belgium) but it was cold and refreshing. After 2 or 3 (probably 4) pints of beer the pizza arrived, (pan pizzas always take between 20-30 minutes no matter where you). The whiff of the pizza as it was laid down in front of me was magical. Caramelized cheese, browned and crispy crust, toppings arranged perfectly and the server even dished out the first slice on my plate too. I also forgot to mention that the people watching in Pequod's, although small and cozy, can be quite interesting and fun too. Cold Beer, Caramelized Pizza, Great Servers and An Inviting Atmosphere, Pequod's is a great Chicago Pizzeria."
"This is the best pan pizza in the city! The way they carmelize the cheese on the crust is awesome, they also do that on their beef sandwiches. I always get a large sausage, it is crumbled not the wheel. If you get the pizza delivered ask for extra sauce and the wings are really tasty. Enjoy!"
My roommate would talk about this place and I had never been until last year when we stopped in after he ran the marathon. The crust is the best part.
"Have eaten there and ordered takeout a number of times.  It's good!  I like the deep dish and the thin crust.  The deep dish is really unique.  There is cheese cooked into the crust.  It's also a bit ""doughier"" that Lou Malnati's, which has more cheese.  It can also be a bit pricey for pizza.  $2 per topping, which adds up.  Especially for someone like me who prefers a lot of different toppings.  My only complaint is the onions.  I feel like other places cut them differently and cook them into the pizza better.  But I still love this place!s  5 stars!"
Deep dish is definitely what this group does well.  Thin Crust is so-so.  Would re-visit.
The deep dish pizza is fantastic!! I highly recommend
"The best Deep dish Pizza in Chicago.  I can't say much else, because that's pretty much all we've got there, but we are always happy when we get pizza from here...the crust is AMAZING!!"
"Pequods' deep dish pizzas have the best pizza crust in the world.  Not ""in Chicago.""  Not ""in the USA.""  The world."
"This is my favorite pizzeria and I absolutely love the carmelized crust.  Love the sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza."
Great pan pizza which I like and my husband loves the thin crust.  Waitstaff always  nice.
"With so much hype around Chicago style pizza- I can say without hesitation this is my favorite in the city. The way the cheese is caramelized and burnt onto the crust is amazing. It's a casual place compared to the big names of Chicago pizza, but the taste beats them all. No contest."
One of the best Chicago style pizzas I ever had.  The best part is you can get great pizza without dealing with all the tourists!  I highly recommend this place.
"Pequod's is a great spot to grab some pizza and a beer, especially if your headed to a movie around the corner.  Their personal deep dish pizza's are filling and very reasonably priced.  All in all another great spot to add to the arsenal of Chicago deep dish places."
"Only place for deep dish. Awesome staff, open late. Well rounded place."
best deep dish pizza is chicago.  the crust solidifies it as number 1 with the carmelized cheese.
"While most rave about their deep dish pizza here, the thin crust might be one of the best in Chicago. The Scene: 2 floors. Bottom floor is a bar type atmosphere...with a bar and tables close to each other. 2nd level more spread out. This place gets very crowded. expect to wait...possibly an hour at times. I have been seated right away during the week but the weekends can get very busy especially being right accross the street from Webster Place Movie theatre.Food: The thin crust pizza to me is one of the best in the city. Cracker thin type crust while the toppings are placed on top of the cheese to give a perfect char to them. They also have a deep dish pizza which many like as well. You will also find many appetizers and salads on the menu. They also have a good bar selection.Staff: Fairly attentive. Never really had a problem. Check this place out if you want a great pizza. Again, you will wait to be seated, and you will wait awhile to get your food. Check it out!"
"Really, really good, we had the large pepperoni deep dish which blows away pizza from the chicago mainstays (malnati's, gino's, giordano's) Pretty expensive though, came to almost 60 for 2 pizzas"
"I've been here twice and each time we've gotten a solid pizza.  I love the crust!!!  The cheese on the pizza is great, but there is nothing better than caramelized cheese on your crust!  Both times we've gotten pepperoni, sausage and mushroom - all the ingredients are quite tasty though I have to say that the more I have sausage the more I don't like it that much, but oh well!  Anyway, there's not much more I can add to this place except to say that it's a great place to go after a movie, especially when it's a later movie and you are absolutely famished by the end of it.  We've seen some crappy movies recently so the pizza afterwards has definitely been the highlight.  The Miller Lite is also always cold and the perfect compliment to our pizza.  Enjoy!"
The best pizza I've ever had in Chicago. The caramelized crust tastes great and the sauce/cheese they use is amazing. I love Pequods.
"some of the best pizza in chicago even though it's not chicago style deep dish. basically a slightly thicker than normal pan pizza with gigantor toppings.  the mojo is in the caramelized crust though.  forget that stuffed crust nonsense, this is probably the only pizza where the crust is the best part.  also pretty tasty delivered but i would definitely dine-in if possible. i'm not sure what the panty-faced whale logo is all about, but he makes a good pizza pie nonetheless."
"I must say, that based on the pizza here, I would give this place 5 , but as for the service, not so much, starting with the good.....the pizza is definitely one of the best in chicago, if not the best, my tastebuds get confused when it comes to this topic because both lou malnatis and pequods  makes every one of my tastebuds in my mouth send climactic signals to my brain. so i cant really pick a front runner. what this pizza brings that others dont is that perfectly carmalized crust.  at first glance you think its burnt, but its not, but is it?? then you take a bite and realize, burnt or freakin' not, that it one hell of a crust.. now as for the bad, the service, I feel like i am doing a crime not giving this place a 5 star review based on the pizza, but the service was really poor on multiple occasions....this definitely doesnt stop me from eating their amazing pizza, because you can always take out......."
this is my favorite pizza in town. worst thing about it is the ambiance at this location.i much prefer the morton grove pequod's.
"Pequod's is quickly becoming one of my favorite pizza joints in the city.  It is a unique pie.  The crust appears to be burnt around the outside, but that my friends is caramelized goodness.  The crust is truly tasty and the main thing that sets this pizza apart from the rest.  The sausage is some of the best I've had on pizza before.  They are also very generous with their toppings.  I know a lot of people are calling it Chicago-style pizza.  I don't think that is quite accurate.  You really can't find another pizza like this in Chicago.  It's one of a kind and that is why you should try it at least once."
"Along with Art of Pizza, this is my favorite place to get pizza from.  If you go between 6-830 on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be in a long line, so it's up to you if you want to stay in it.  When I brought my GF, this catapulted to the top of her favorite pizza places in the city.  My brother and dad don't care for the pizza and I just can't figure out why.  I think they like thin crust moreso than pan/deep dish pizzas, so maybe they were biased from the beginning.  My usual pie is the pan with sausage and green peppers.  I've tried a few of the apps and they're good, but they just get in the way of the pizza.  I like to sit upstairs more than downstairs.  Honestly, I can't wait for the next time I go.  I do find that when I reheat the pizza in the oven the next, it's definitely not as good.  So eat up while you're there."
"Hands down the best pizza in chicago. The food is there is something youll find your self talking about  when ever u hear the word ""Pizza"". I love there food. The next best thing about this place is there delivery. If your like me and like to stay in and pop a movie and order pizza then this is your spot. There drivers r the best. They always get to me quick and the pizza is always hot unlike father and son or chicago pizza.  So if your looking for a unique and tasteful pizza place with express delivery then Pequods is your place."
"Pequod's has the best pan pizza. We usually get the pan sausage/pepperoni.  The thin crust is excellent too. The thick crust, topped with alot of meat. As good as it gets."
we go every few weeks.  it is the best....  you need to get extra sauce on the pan pizza's that is the key!!!!
"THE best pizza in Chicago. We dont even bother with any other deep dish places anymore. This is our only option.Love everything about it. The carmelized cheesy crust, sauce, toppings...The upstairs area is so much more appealing now after the renovation. They have plenty of seating now and 2 full bars. Perfect place to go before a movie at Webster Place!"
Best pizza I have ever had.  I had to start talking tattoo artists with the waitress though to get any kind of hospitality.  But I guess it's Chicago and not KY.
"The deep dish pizza was fantastic! We got pepperoni with extra sauce, and it was really flavorful and not too dough-y. Don't bother with the thin crust variety; it's just not worth it. Too much crust on the rim, and too much dough in general for what you'd expect from a thin crust pizza."
"Recently moved back to Chicago from Los Angeles & was craving PIZZA!!  Had heard good things from friends so decided to give this place a try!  Was not let down;)  I ordered a pepperoni, mushroom, & onion pizza with thin braided crust..........DELICIOUS!  Staff was friendly with the exception of Ms. Grouchy, the manager.  Will definitely order take out next time."
"Pequod's is without a doubt the best in Chicago pizza.  Whenever someone from out of town comes to visit, and I want to impress them with Chicago food, I take them here first.  Start things off with a bang.  More often then not, my guests will love the food so much they'll purchase a t-shirt from behind the bar as a keep sake.  The deep dish is good here, as good as a deep dish can be, I guess.  To me, a deep dish pizza is nothing more than a stomach ache topped with cheese.  You have to love this place for it's New York style pizza...so thin...so delicious.  The sauce is unheard of...I heard the owner traded his first born child for it....and the crust is just right.  Not too crispy, not too soft....but a whole lot of perfect.  Pepperoni and sausage is my favorite, but I will give you some advice, my dear pizza loving friend.  If you order Pepperoni, ask for ""light pepperoni.""  This will give you as much as you get on a normal pizza.  If you don't request this, you will find yourself drowning in a sea of hundreds of pepperoni....out of which you may never escape."
"I've never heard of caramelized crust until trying Peqoud's. Woww, if they sold the crust alone, I'd pay. I'm not usually a big fan of deep dish pizzas. It's been a few months since I've dined here, but I remember that the service was good and quick, my cup of joe never went empty. I'll have to make another round here soon."
Wow.  We just get the pan cheese pizza from here but it is fabulous.  That caramelized onion crust makes a huge difference between an okay pizza and a fabulous one.
great pizza!!! went there for lunch today and fell in love with the crust everyone talks about. maybe had a beer too many on my lunch break but hey... don't judge me!
Crispy baked-on-cheese crust. Definitely my favorite deep dish in Chicago.
"definately worthwhile if you are looking for something different when it comes to pizza. they make their pizza crust from carmelized cheese. if you decide to dine, you'll find it roomy, clean, and nice widescreen televisions playing sports and awesome music channels. thumbs up."
"yummmmmm - great cheesy pizza, thick carmelized crust.  oooh, my mouth is watering.  looks like all of nothing on the outside, but the food is great.  big upstairs too.  great for a pizza before a movie on webster."
"I will only bring out of towners to try Pequod's deep dish. Other places are good, but Pequod's blows all the rest out of the water. If you read most of the people who reviewed and gave less than 3 stars you'll note that they all mention they didn't order the deep dish. There might've been a few that did order the deep dish - but you can't please everyone. Apparently, the trick here, is to only get the deep dish, otherwise, it's anyones guess how your meal will turn out. This place is great, in my opinion. My suggestion: Deep dish, at the location (delivery might render a slightly more mushy pizza), beer and one topping only. This is why I minus one star from the five star pizza. The toppings issue. They're $2 for each damn topping! $2 for onion?? Seriously - I should omit 2 stars for that sort of tom foolery but the crust is so good that I can't. I love this pizza. Maybe bring some mushrooms, onions and other easy to fold away in your pocket foods to top the pizza once it gets to you. :) But then that's just kinda weird. People might stare. Either way, this pizza is rock star!"
"Yum! Pequods' pizza is delicious and definitely worth a visit.  It's not typical Chicago pizza, but if you're up for crispy pan pizza, this is the place to go. It's not as bready or cheesy as most pan pizzas around Chicago, but the burnt crust sets it apart than others. I would suggest ordering extra cheese because the cheese is kind of scarce without it. There is also a lunch special too which I like best because the pizzas are small making the bread extra crisp."
"some of the best deep dish in chicago; however, I only give 4 stars because I prefer more sauce and less breading. The toppings are awesome though. especially the sausage. and... have some of the best outer crust ive ever had"
"the best! i've lived in chicago for 16 years, and eaten a lot of pizza. and although i'll always prefer thin-crust (i eat pizza for the toppings, not the crust), i gotta confess that pequod's is hands-down the best deep-dish i've ever had. nothing even comes close to their carmelized cheese crust (which somehow isn't overly dense) and zippy, not-too-sweet sauce. it's pretty far from my house, so no delivery - boo! - but sometimes the cravings are so strong i'll fight traffic and make the trip. it can get crowded on the weekends, so go early, or try a weeknight."
The best pizza in Chicago! No doubt. Their thrin crust pizza is really good since I'm not a big fan of deep dish. Though I do eye up other people's deep dish pizza's which look incredibly good so I might try it next time.
"I'm visiting from California, so I had to see what real deep dish pizza is all about.  Pequod's has kind of a dive bar feel, which I like.  Brick walls and music blaring, ranging from old school punk to Johnny Cash.  The pizza was amazing.  It's all about the caramelized cheese.  It gives it an added tasty kick.  They were also very generous with the toppings.  I definitely had no regrets, just a happy belly."
The best deep dish pizza in the world!
"Anyone who thinks that Lou Malnati's or Gino's is the best pizza in Chicago is a moron. Pequods is the best. Don't bother with the thin crust. It really isn't anything special, but you can't beat the deep dish. I like to eat there and order delivery. It is always consistent. However, I was with friends who wanted mushrooms, which I don't love but I dealt with it. The mushrooms made the pizza a little soggy. I wouldn't recommend getting them, but every other time I have had this pizza (which is often) it is the best. The caramelized crust is fantastic."
"As a new Chicago resident I relied on Yelp for my craving for pizza.  (I am pregnant)  I ordered a pan pizza for pick up.  They said it would take 30 min.  It was ready when I got there. I live less than a half-mile away and waited about 15 minutes before I left my residence.  The pizza was great. I love the sauce, cheese, crust and the pepperoni!! I added jalepenos (to encourage labor :)) and it was delicious! My husband loved it too.    * Next time I think we will stay and eat it there, the atmosphere was good and they weren't very busy (its was mothers day).  I cant wait to try the beers on tap!"
BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO PERIOD.....  The size of the toppings are very generous.  We usually get green peppers and it comes with large slices of peppers.  The best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese around the edges of the pizza.  I wish there was a way to just get the crust and a sauce to dip in.  Excellent.  Only one issue in all the times I ordered and it was there was not enough sauce on the pie.  If you like a lot of sauce I would suggest asking for extra sauce.
"Paquiano's is a good good day.  That buttery crust really hits the spot.  However, I've had mixed results as far as delivery times and it's still not as good as Lou's.  It's a unique pizza that I will get once in a while."
"i can't believe there seem to be endless amazing pizzerias in chicago.  i get it already!  the pizza at pequod's is super delicious.  the burnt carmelized crust is the best part.  it made me feel real full real fast, though.  after an order of cheesy garlic bread, i could only handle one piece!  i also love the atmosphere.  it has a great feeling to it; like a perfect place for ""family night"" but without being lame.  i can't wait to go again."
"great pizza, fun venue. catch a movie at the amc across the street and come late (it's usually pretty busy and ALWAYS loud, so coming late cuts down on the people noise). yum."
"I'm giving this 4 stars because it's my second favortie pizza in the city.  My favorite is Art of Pizza, which has a deep (dish) place in my heart.  The carmelized cheese is what makes this so tasty and unique.  I love the sausage and jalapeno and they have some tasty beers on tap.  If it's your mission to try as many Chicago Pizza joints, this needs to be on your list!  The only thing that stinks is the street parking, can be a little difficult in that neighborhood."
"it's deep dish, but not so much that you feel disgustingly heavy afterwards.  super tasty toppings.  i left my crust and was told by someone i was with that i should eat it.  i didn't realize there was caramelized cheese on there!  i'm so glad i didn't miss that feature of it, b/c it was really yummy!  i was visiting from out of town, and this was a really good ""chicago style pizza"" choice for me to go to."
"Before I discovered Pequods, I was a stalwart supporter of the Lou Malnati deep dish, but the caramelized cheese crust is the best I've ever had. Its nary burnt and is complimented by a saltier, sweeter, sauce than Lou's.  Its cheaper too, and the kitchen's open til 2am most days allowing you to gorge late at night. The lunch special, a personal pan pizza, is size of almost two slices and comes with a pint of beer or pop for 5 bucks. The staff is always super nice, even late as hell when you think you're being a bother. Calling ahead is always a great idea when ordering deep dish otherwise you'll  have a 45 min wait.  This place is hands down my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago."
This is the best pizza in the city.  I like the deep dish sausage or the thin pepperoni.  If it was healthy to do so I'd eat it every night of the week.
I tried for the first time today.  I thought the deep dish was delicious.  Will be back often.
"By far, the best chicagoland pizza place because of their nontraditional crust. For all the suburban folks, another pequod's pizza hidden in the streets of Morton Grove. Good eats and great atmosphere."
"Not a huge fan of Deep Dish in general, but of the Chicago Deep Dish joints this is probably my favorite.  I went there with a group of people on Sunday night and we were able to get a table pretty quickly.  Also, if you're not a big Deep Dish eater, they have thin crust (it's actually more like regular crust) pizza and it's really, really good."
"best deep dish pizza i have ever had for sure, love this place"
"Pequods is by far the best Chicago pizza.  It doesnt get the recognition it deserves.  The part of the crust that looks burnt is the best part.  Only thing they can work on is the service.  Our waitress wasnt friendly or attentive, and it wasnt busy.  But overall this place is worth the mediocre service."
"Great Chicago 'Za.  The key here is to ask for the pizza ""well done"" meaning the cheese is baked until carmelized around the edges.  This is deep dish, but not stuffed pizza.  Pep/Mushroom combo is solid.  Currently the location in the city is under reconstruction, but they will deliver from the burbs if you call the regular number.  Worth the wait on delivery and a must visit once they re-open at the intersection of clyb/webster."
"This pizza is absolutely the best deep dish in Chicago.  The carmelized crust is the bomb. Sometimes it is sausage, onion and mushroom, other times it is canadian bacon and pineapple.  Everytime, it is mouth watering delicious.  Delivery can take a long time, so if you are able to pick it up yourself, you can get your slice of heaven much quicker, but if not, it is well worth the wait."
"My girlfriend I ventured to this Lincoln Park establishment last night based on reviews from fellow yelpers.  Upon arriving, I immediately knew I would enjoy sitting in this place and having a cold beer because of the lively atmosphere.  However, I didn't know if I would enjoy eating their pie.  I am always skeptical of pizza places that claim to be better than Gino's East or Lou's.We started off with the Combo appetizer which includes cheese sticks, fried mushroom caps, fried zucchini, and poppers.  All of this for 9 bucks definitely worth the money.  Then had the house salad which included carrots, olives, tomatoes, and chopped romaine.  Also, a pretty good deal at 4 bucks a salad.  Now for the main course, we ordered the large pizza in hopes we would enjoy it enough to last through the weekend.  My half of the pizza was sausage, onions, and green pepper (this is what I normally order at Lou's or Gino's).  The pizza arrived at our table with the patented black crust and the eating began.  I believe the true test of Chicago deep dish pizza is actually the final bite of pizza where you get the crust and the toppings all in one.  I immediately turned my pizza around and took this bite.  It was great the crust was crunchy and airy at the same time.  The toppings were plentiful and the sausage had good seasoning.  When I saw the black crust I wondered how can that not taste burnt, but it didn't.  It tasted like, well... caramelized cheese,brilliant!  For 4 beers, appetizer, salad, pizza, and tip this experience cost us $74.00 and we still have three quarters of a pizza left to enjoy.  Although I would not rank these guys above Lou's or Gino's I wont rank them below either."
"Great pizza, great crust, laid back bar atmosphere. I'm a fan"
"Maxim named this best pizza in Chicago.  I'm going to have to agree that i was very impressed.  You can smell its awesome aroma from outside.  I've only had the non-stuffed, thin crust pizza.  It isn't your typical thin crust, it's more like a ""handtossed"" or pan crust.  I recommend double the cheese and sausage!!! Outstanding!!!  Great service, even when you are arguing about what toppings to get on the pizza :-)  It's moderately priced."
"OOH that carmelized cheese.  The elusive 5 star pizza award is once again handed out to Pequods.  2 locations to serve you, one in morton grove for the nw people and one in the city on webster.  quality and continuity is the same at each location so feel free to go wherever is closest.  IF you do not like deep dish pizza, keep moving, this is their specialty.  lets look at the pizza, shall we?  First thing you notice is that like true deep dish pizza (ala uno/due) it is served at your table in the pan it was cooked in, this is very important as the hot pan continues to crisp the pizza as you wait for your next slice (pinoccio's in niles could take this lesson) so your za never gets soggy. Second, it looks like it should, lots of oh so good carmelized cheese on the edge of each slice.  Thirdly, toppings are GENEROUS and excellent.  Truly a sausage lovers dream, but the other toppings are just as good, just not as stand out.  I am pretty big pizza eater, but 2 slices of pequods and I'm done.  I'd reccommend sizing your pizza with a 2-3 slice expectancy.  Also, pequods pizza has a great ability to be reheated and lose very little of it's original flavor.  I attribute this to the low moisture content of the dough after it cooks, but who knows for sure.  morton grove is a small place, but you can call ahead before you get there to get the pizza going.  Chicago is a larger operation, but parking can suck.  I know chicago will deliver, not sure about morton grove.  Waitstaff in MG is very freindly.  If you have out of town guests who are dying for unos/due's but you hate going downtown, feel confident with this fine representation of Chicago's Classic Deep Dish."
