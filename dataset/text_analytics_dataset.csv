0,"My faaave deep dish in chicago with an N of two. The crust is super buttery and less soggy more crispy than other deep dish I've tried. Pizza pie was my favorite. Pro tip, you can order take out and eat at the BYOP (bring your own pizza) bar and library across the street.  If you're traveling to chicago and can only try one deep dish spot, this is it!!",2,0,positive
1,"Finally got to try Pequod's, service was a 3 and the pizza was a 5. To my taste, it was way better  than pizza's from usual Chicago chains. I went there on a  Friday around 2pm and was super happy to not have to wait hours to get a table. Regarding the restaurant, it looks like a dark dive bar, nothing fancy. We didn't get explanation for the menu (it would have been appreciated). Basically you get to choose between 3 regular pizzas and then you can add as many toppings as you want (for an additional charge). I like they have a caramelized crust. You're going for a deep dish, so get your table before you're starving because it takes a long time to cook haha! as delicious warmed up in the oven the next day! I got a salad to wait, it was okay, it comes with a plastic cup of red vinegar and another one of olive oil, not the best one though. As far of the pizza, the ingredients were fresh, the dough was good and we got some to go! (We were so hungry we forgot to take a pic of it) I'll go back but probably to take out.",11,1,positive
2,Easily the best deep dish in Chicago!I don't have much more to add to this page but I will recommend getting extra sauce and extra cheese....it really makes a difference!,2,0,positive
3,"This style deep dish is the thick crust pan style pizza, even though it wasn't the super cheesy topped off with sauce on top that I assumed all Chicago deep dish was this is still some really good pizza.The restaurant itself is kind of a dive sports bar, lots of seating & lots of tv, a good variety of beers & appetizers to go with the pizza selection.",5,1,positive
4,"Let me preface this by saying that I just don't like deep dish pizza. I'm a NY pizza guy and after trying a few pizza places in Chicago, I have confirmed that I am not a big fan. I had higher hopes for Pequod since many sites talked about it being better because of the carmelized crust. Not really. You couldn't tell much of a difference from the crust.The overall pizza was fine but it's something that you could only have one piece and then you're left feeling heavy. Also, it's hard to tell distinct differences between pizzas when it's deep dish other than the sauce.This place is fine but probably not somewhere I would seek out the next time I'm in Chicago.",4,1,negative
5,"First time having deep dish pizza!Wonderful place -- didn't have to wait too long and the service was so nice! Gave us a great recommendation for pizza and was so friendly!We got one of the custom deep dish ones and shared among three people. We got the smallest size and we still couldn't finish it. Would definitely say its a great bargain for the price and would warn you to not underestimate their food. We also shared some wings, which I loved as well.Definitely recommend!",8,1,positive
6,I tried lou malnatis while in chicago and I preferred pequodsLou malnatis fell short for mebut pequods was greatit was only about a 10minute waitbut a 40minute wait for the pizza to come outthe sauce was so good!! and the caramelized/burnt cheese crust was greatgot a large and i only ended up being able to finish one slicetook home the leftovers but the pizza still tasted great after,2,1,positive
7,As deep dish pizza's go this one is one of the ones you have to try. Situated outside of downtown chicago it has more of a bar atmosphere than a pizza joint. Service was great as they explained everything and catered towards the table. The toppings are what make this place stand out. The tomato sauce and all the fresh toppings you can choose from. The sausage is top notch. Spicey italian with great flavor. The pizza crust has more of a biscuit like flavor and texture so it's definitely unique to the area. Very filling even for the small size pan which can easily be shared with others.Give it a try.,5,0,negative
8,"Pequod's does not have any pre-made signature pizza toppings like the other popular deep dish spots; instead, all of their pizzas are customizable. With this said, they do not allow pre-ordering your pizza while waiting for your table (probably to ensure you don't skip town, but why would you?!) When my friend and I arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday, the placed was completely packed. There was a 90 minute wait for us, but luckily we found two stools at the bar instead.Since we knew how heavy the pizza was about to be, we started off with a house salad with italian dressing ($4.80). After over an hour later, our small size pan pizza ($11.75) finally arrived. We also added italian beef (+$2.75) and mushrooms (+$1.85) inside too. The pizza was nicely done and that first slice was delicious. All of the ingredients were stuffed into the cheese and marinera sauce being held together in a crunchy crust. As much as I wanted to finish both of my slices, I only got through my second slice halfway. The special part about Pequod's is its customization (you can even do half and half on the pizza to make everyone in the party happy). But because of this, they also take much longer. Thankfully I was not too hungry or else my patience would have truly been tested here. Although Pequod's is a bit further outside of Chicago, it's still worth the trek over here --but I'd definitely recommend coming here at odd hours to shorten the wait time.",8,0,positive
9,"During a weeklong work trip in Chicago, I knew my co-worker and I had to eat deep dish at one point during the week. I mentioned to our client that we were thinking of Lou Malnati's, and he basically persuaded us to go to Pequod's instead. In his words, ""Lou Malnati's is good; Pequod's is great.""We arrived around 8PM on a Tuesday, and the place was packed! We got a pager, sat outside to look at the menu, and our pager buzzed within a few minutes. Since it was just us 2, we decided on a small pan pizza with bell peppers and Canadian bacon as toppings (bell peppers were extra topping; Canadian bacon was half extra). Honestly I loved the fact that they offered half toppings because sometimes two people just can't get along! But in this case, my co-worker was vegetarian but I knew I needed some meat.I know there's nothing like Chicago deep dish, and this experience reiterated that. I did feel like the crust was a little thick, but it didn't really change what I thought about the pizza. The crust was AMAZING!! I looked forward to that extra crunch with every slice I ate (I only ate 2).We had zero regrets changing our plans from Lou Malnati's to Pequod's. The World Series was on, and it honestly felt like a place where the locals go. I would absolutely come here again!",7,1,positive
10,"Excellent pizza is completely irrelevant when the server lies to your table's face. One star reviews are automatic from me when a server blames the kitchen, or lies. In this case, it was both. We walked in when the host stand said 45 minutes for a pizza- we waited 80, and were given no apologies or anything from our server. We asked repeatedly when our pizza might be up, and were met with just shrugs and no empathy or apologies. She just told us that the wait time was over an hour for our pizzas. I didn't bother debating because there's really no point. Around the 60 minute mark, she began avoiding our table entirely. We asked for our checks before our pizza even came, because we had to be somewhere after dinner. At least she accommodated that.",1,1,negative
11,"Awesome deep dish pizza, atmosphere and if possible even better service!  Called ahead and although they do not take reservations will take priority seating.  Good news there, it cut our wait from 60 to 30 minutes.  Plenty of room next door at the Whale Tail for a drink before dinner.  Beeper so we knew when table was ready.  True Chicago style deep dish with a crisp bottom crust.  Delicious!  Staff was running but didn't miss a beat on low drinks and rapid refills.  Appreciated the management sign on graffiti on the walls but only added to the ambiance of a unique location!",4,0,positive
12,"To my knowledge there are pretty much three iconic Chicago foods, Italian beef, a Chicago hot dog and deep dish pizza.  Of the three, the pizza was the one I had the least interest in trying while we were in town vacationing.  I've had them in various forms before, at an Uno's franchise in NC, Lou Malnati's delivered frozen to cook at home.  You could argue that those are not ""original"" in one way or another but whatever...  I've always been underwhelmed.Still, when in Chicago it seemed somehow wrong not to get deep dish one day so after a Cub's comeback win at Wrigley we went to Pequod's which was my choice after much Yelp research and a couple sightings on Food Network.  The draw to me was the ring of caramelized cheese around the top of the crust.  What an awesome choice it was and not just because of the delicious cheesy ring.  The entire pizza was outstanding. The crust (thick but not too thick, crispy but not greasy) sausage and pepperoni (tasty and plenty of it) and sauce (just pure tomato goodness) made for a really, really good meal.  The ability to get personal sized pizzas made it easy for me to get the meat fest and my wife to get just cheese so no need to even compromise!I guess you can call me a convert and Pequod's gets all the credit.  Oh yeah, we had some buffalo wings before the pizza and they were good as well.",13,4,positive
13,"The last time I was in Chicago and had deep-dish pizza, I got food poisoning (thanks, Lou Malnati's!  Never again!)  But, my cousin really wanted to try some Chicago-style pizza while we were in town for the Chicago Marathon, so I acquiesced on the conditions that 1) we only ate the pizza AFTER the marathon and 2) we ate anywhere BUT Lou Malnati's.After doing some research, we settled on Pequod's and took a taxi over to Chicago's North Side to stuff our faces after finishing the race.  It was about 2 PM when we showed up and this place was PACKED!  Fortunately, we were able to grab a table for two immediately.  As an FYI: Pequod's bakes their pizzas from scratch, and since it's a pan pizza, it takes a bit longer to cook (about 40 minutes), so if you're HANGRY, it's better to call in your order ahead of time by phone.To stave off the runger, we ordered a sampler of their Appetizer Combo, which featured fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, and fried zucchini bites.  I'm not gonna lie, this was pretty unremarkable and not worth writing about, but we were starving and needed something to tide us over til the pizza arrived.When our pizza pie finally got delivered, I could not WAIT to dig in!  Technically, pan pizza is different than deep-dish, but Pequod's pizza is still an experience you can really only find in Chicago.  It features a thick crust with slightly burnt edges (""caramelized,"" as the restaurant calls it) and layers of cheese and sauce, with your choice of toppings piled on (we chose sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers).While my first experience with deep dish at Lou Malnati's left me unimpressed, I really enjoyed the pan pizza at Pequod's.  The crust was thick without being too doughy, and sturdy enough to hold up to all the sauce and cheese without becoming soggy.  The caramelized burnt edges added a nice crunchy texture.  The ingredients tasted fresh and they did NOT skimp on the amount of toppings!  The sauce tasted very tomatoey (in a good way) and not canned.Also, this pizza is FILLING.  Two hungry dudes who had just run 26.2 miles couldn't even finish all six slices of their medium sized pizza.  So come hungry, and bring plenty of friends!OVERALL: 4/5.  Skip the appetizers and go straight for their famous pan pizza.  It's rich, delicious, and worth every single calorie and clogged artery.  I'm sure both NYC and Chicago-style purists can agree that the pizza at Pequod's is darn good!",14,4,positive
14,"Ordered Pequod's for delivery to our hotel after a long day of traveling. They estimated 2 hours for delivery but it actually came in 1.5 hours which was nice. The pizza was just okay for me. I think I would like to try the thin crust next time. If I were a fan of deep dish, this would be great. They definitely don't skimp on the toppings which is nic",3,0,positive
15,"Detroit style pizza disguised as Chicago style pizza lol. Pizza is really good thought. Definitely five stars for sure. I called in my pizza and it still took every bit of one hour so be prepared to wait or call it in like I did. Price: They have an amazing lunch special for 5-6 bucks that comes with a drink. I mean that is such a steal! Really good quality pizza for less that ten dollars. It's very filling as well. I was completely full of the person loan pizza special. Food: they call it Chicago style pizza but this reminds me a lot of Detroit style pizza. When I think of Chicago pizza I think of Lou malnatis or Giordano's. Pequod's is a fusion of Chicago meets Detroit. The caramelized crust is something Detroit is know for. I don't think any other Chicago pizza place does their crust like this. I personally love it! Also the bread is very thick with just a little bit of cheese and sauce on top. Check mark  Detroit style pizza. The sauce is a little on the tangy side. Still really good. Glad I was able to get it.  Reminded me a lot of via 313 out of Austin Texas (via 313 is from Detroit) As of right star pizza in Houston Texas makes the best deep fish Chicago pizza I've ever had. The owners are from Chicago. Look them up. Also Windy City pizza in antascacita Texas is number 2. Owner is from Chicago. If you are ever in Houston, try those two out.",11,1,positive
16,"Came here as part of a Chicago pizza tour, was not disappointed. This is one of the 3 main styles of ""Chicago-style"" pizza (in order of thickness, thick to slim): Deep Dish, Pan, Tavern.The pizza here is pan.It's thick, but it's not ""wedding cake"" thick like some of the deep dish can be.The main star of this pizza was the sausage.  It was perfectly spiced.  It made you think ""what's in this?"" in a good way.Service was excellent and beer selection was above average.  Ambiance was like that of a normal, divey bar that has been around for a long time, which I liked.",6,1,positive
17,"When in Chicago, one MUST have deep dish. It just ain't right if you leave the city without tucking into their specialty.Since I've already had Lou Malnati's, I really wanted to try something different this time around. Some quick googling told me Pequod's was THE place for deep dish so off we went. The four of us showed up around lunchtime on a Saturday and were promptly seated. The space is like a no-frills divey bar filled with tchotchkes and old, worn booths. Staff was super friendly and really made us feel welcome.We ended up waiting about 45mins for a large pizza stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms and bell peppers. This baby was FILLING and the caramelized crust was amazing and so freakin' crispy! It was everything deep dish should be; gooey, hearty, and packed with fillings. Each of us ended up eating a slice and we took two to go. TL;DR Fantastic pizza. Just go.",6,1,positive
18,"When visiting Chicago, we visited quite a few Chicago pizza joints and Pequod's was by far our favorite. Pequod's is where the locals go is what we were told, which seemed very true once walking in. It's like your neighborhood sports bar. The pizza here is a pan pizza and not so much a stuffed pizza like some other places. It's got a thick crust with caramelized cheese on the edges, a very delightful sauce, and fresh toppings.  I absolutely loved every bite of this pizza and wish my hometown had something similar. If you're a local, I'm sure you already know about Pequod's. If you're a tourist, make sure you make Pequod's your first pizza stop.",6,0,positive
19,Met up with my husband for a quick lunch date. We ordered the lunch special of the personal pizza and pop for $5! Can't beat that deal. It was my first time here and I am a fan. I love the burnt cheese on the edges! Prob cut and burnt my mouth since I have zero patience once my pizza gets to the table. We also ordered the jalapeño poppers which were basic but always good. Will def be back whenever I am in the area!,3,0,positive
20,"As a visitor to Chicago, Pequods was a good pizza to ""try once, but not again"". It's a bit off the beaten path, especially if you're staying in the central downtown areas (Mag Mile, River North). I arrived there soon after they opened for lunch on a Saturday, and boy did the place fill up quickly. I opted for their pan pizza, of course, with meatball on one half and sausage on the other. It takes 45 minutes between ordering and receiving the pizza. I agree with the reviewer who said that Pequods is more Detroit-style than Chicago-style. IMO, it's a different type of pizza. It's good, and the caramelized crust is delicious, but I found the rest of the pizza to be underwhelming.",3,0,negative
21,"I came here with a few friends with the goal of finally trying out some of Chicago's deep-dish pizza. This place serves pan pizza but based on the way service explained it, this pretty much still counts.This place has a bar and a lot of appetizer options in addition to the pizza. Pan pizza takes a long time to make, but if you get an appetizer and a few drinks, the time will fly by. The fries are delicious and from what I've seen, the appetizers come in awesome portion sizes, so it's definitely worth your buck.The pan pizza coming felt like an early Christmas gift. There is a LOT of pizza and the service helped us by cutting and plating it for us. We got a couple of vegetable toppings on one half and regular cheese on the other half. It turned out to be absolutely delicious and filling. Definitely worth a try and absolutely worth it.Considering that each slice of pan pizza is basically 2 pizza slices equivalent of food, the price is amazing if you split it among a few people. This place is also open pretty late, so this could make for good pregame or post-game food, depending on how you go about your night.Overall, fantastic experience. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area.",13,1,positive
22,"Damn good pizza!  All you need to order is a large deep dish sausage and you are good!  The carmelized crust is outstanding!  If you don't like this pizza, stay home with your frozen pizzas and thin crust appetizers!Get here early, it's packed every night from 6 to 9.Service is good, it's also a Nebraska Cornhusker bar which is a shame.",5,2,positive
23,"Pequod's was the first stop on our epic Chicago Pizza Tour, where we were introduced to our first #pizzastyle: pan pizza. And oh, was it delicious. We were each served a huge, thick slice of their pepperoni and sausage pie, with its hearty layer of house-made red sauce, gooey melted cheese, and topped with amazing meat. Especially the sausage. Omg, that sausage. It was so good I'm seriously considering booking the next flight back to O'Hare. The restaurant had set aside a special seating area just for our group, which was a nice perk of being on the tour cuz this place was hopping. We also got some drinks, and I chose a local beer. Which was sort of a mistake, considering the size of the pizza. The beer was good but I was only able to drink about half of it due to the yummy pizza filling my tummy.  The service was also super friendly, they didn't seem annoyed by us as some restaurants can when you go on one of these food tours.  They were also very efficient, as we were served right away and were able to eat and drink and be out of there in about 30 minutes so we could be off to our next stop. I will definitely return here on my next trip, whenever that may be!",9,1,positive
24,Today for toppings we had Italian Beef Sausage mushrooms spinach basil green olives. It's Fine and the caramelized crust is there. But it's only the edge of your pizza the crust itself is just Ok.  I prefer Pequod's with the extra sauce that's makes it distinctive for me. Otherwise this pizza is just average,2,0,negative
25,"Okay I'M SAYING IT. This is the best deep dish in Chicago.We got the pepperoni and sausage medium, and it was everything I would ever want it to be. The crust, the sauce to cheese ratio, the amount of pepperoni on each slice... I'm still dreaming about it.I called in the order ahead of time, and they wouldn't put it in the oven until we were seated - which confused me. Why would I bother calling in ahead of time when I can just order at the table for the same amount of time? Don't see why that is an option. We still waited 30 min for the pizza. It is so out of my way, but I will definitely be back.",1,2,positive
26,"Pequod's was my first ever deep dish and it was sooo good! I went here on my first trip to Chicago with a group of girls and we deliberated over which pizza place to try. Pequod's won and I'm glad they did! We stopped in around 4pm on a Saturday and they were busy but not slammed. We were able to get a table right away. Note that you will still wait 45 minutes for your pizza. It takes some time for them to caramelize the crust and this is what sets Pequod's apart. We ordered two pies for 5 people and we still had leftovers. Deep dish is filling but we also had late dinner reservations so we didn't want to eat too much. I ate the veggie deep dish and it was so good! The crust was hearty and delicious and the cheese was everything. I would like to try a couple of other deep dish spots for the sake of comparison but I can't imagine it getting much better. The service was good and the atmosphere is lively but laid back. I am not sure what part of town we were in because we took a Lyft and I wasn't paying attention. I think this is the only location, though. I would definitely recommend!",11,0,positive
27,"What a disappointment it's all crust. This is supposed to have extra cheese on it where is the extra cheese? Actually where are the ingredients? You really have gone downhill, serving this is an embarrassment.",0,3,negative
28,"I may not be from a place that is known for any famous pizza and I am normally a NY style fan...but Pequod's turned me into a deep dish fan as well...BUT as long as it's from here! Peqoud's was our 2nd deep dish place and it blew our minds away. We went on an off time (around 2-3pm) on a Sunday but there was still a little wait (about 15-20 minutes) so we wanted to save time and instead grabbed 2 empty seats at the bar since we know we also have to wait another 45 minutes for the pizza to be cooked. We ordered a small pepperoni and sausage deep dish to share. The crust is covered in melted cooked cheese- which gave the crust a great crunch. The small deep dish was enough for 2 of us. They loaded and I mean loaded the pizza with pepperoni and sausage! And the best thing, it was probably high quality meats because it was not greasy at all. The sausage was probably the best I had on a pizza. The tomato sauce wasn't too sweet or sour, it was the right cooked down tangy flavor. Also, the crust was not hard as a rock, instead was the right softness and hardness. We enjoyed every last bite...",10,3,positive
29,"I can see why this place has such a huge cult following. Great deep dish pizzas that have a slight char on the outside, descent priced drinks and a relaxing and chaotic atmosphere. The wait was like 45 minutes to get a table but luckily I was allowed to squeeze into the bar and skipped all the wait. Still, call ahead if you can or just don't come starving. It's worth the wait if you have to.",2,1,positive
30,"I've been so excited to try this place for years.  I've been on the hunt for a similar go to for deep dish! We got here after a walking tour ended and were seated quickly!  The tables and chairs are old and my chair was even taped up.  It looks very aged. I'm so glad we got there early because when we left there was a 45 minute wait.We quickly knew what we wanted (Sausage and pepperoni pizza), and I ordered a beer and my husband ordered a diet drink. The pizza came out about 35 minutes later, which was what we anticipated.  I was very excited for the cheese pull when she served us our slices but there was barely one.  Note: next time I'll order extra cheese.  However, there were a lot of toppings and I still really loved this pizza it just wasn't like the videos I've seen before. One thing to note, when the bill came it ""suggested"" tips on the iPad; however, it was based on the subtotal plus tax rather than the sub-total... I have to say that was a bit shady to me, as sales tax is over 10% in Chicago and is not supposed to be included as part of tipping and I bet most customers don't even pay attention to this. There is an option to change your tip to a different percentage or dollar amount, but you have to notice what is happening.  I hope this gets changed. I'd like to give them another try when we visit the city again.",6,1,positive
31,"Maybe it's because I haven't had deep dish in a while, but Pequod's was really not all that everyone else had hyped it up to be...I went to Pequod's when a friend from out of town was visiting Chicago (usually the only times I eat deep dish these days is when someone is visiting). I was incredibly excited because I had heard so many great things about Pequod's-- that it was better than all the other deep dish restaurants. I felt like the vibe of the place was...unique. The restaurant is actually quite large, has a lot of different nooks and crannies, with multiple screens projecting various channels at the same time. We were placed in the very back, and it actually felt quite dark where we were. But maybe that's the vibe Pequod's is going for-- I won't hold it against them.As for the pizza itself, we ordered ahead of time and waited about 25-30 minutes for the pizza to come out (which is not the longest I've waited). I will hand it to them -- I really enjoyed the pizza crusts. Cheesy, crispy/slightly burnt (a good thing!), but not too overwhelming at the same time. As for the rest of the pizza however, I thought it was pretty average. Maybe I'm more of a cheese person, but I thought the pizza was very dough-y and lacked a solid amount of sauce + cheese. We added pepperoni and basil to our pizza, which was ok.Overall, I felt like this place didn't live up to the hype (or perhaps the issue was that there was too much hype to begin with?). Maybe it's just not for me, though.",10,3,negative
32,"Bam!  Quality Chicago style deep dish pizza!  Although I ordered it to go and had to wait 25 minutes until I got to my hotel, it was still delicious and the crust was crispy.  I got the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The ingredients were fresh and plentiful.  Careful what size you order as this pizza is satisfying and filling.  This is a must stop by place if you are in Chicago.  Don't miss the opportunity to have the best Chicago style deep dish in the country.  Even if you don't like deep dish, give this one a try.  You will be",6,0,positive
33,"For most of my life, I considered Pequods to be the best pizza in Chicago.  Recently I had a pie from there for take out.  It was my first time having Pequods in almost a decade.  It's out of the way for me and the wait time is serious.  But I was in the area and craving deep dish.  I usually only eat thin crust these days.  I like Detroit style too.To my shock, I found I don't like this pizza anymore.  It is 90% bread.  There is almost no cheese or sauce.  The best thing about the pizza was the toppings.  The mushrooms were particularly succulent.The burnt crust is still nice, but I can get that at Jets or Fat Chris's now, and Detroit style is preferable to pan.I think pan pizza is gross now.  I thought Pequods was deep dish all these years.  Oops.  I tried.  I was excited to eat it.  But after the first few bites I knew I was eating just a pile of bread.  It's not balanced.  Lesson learned.I got take out on a Monday night.  I stood in an absolutely jam packed, claustrophobic area not meant for standing, with several others picking up and frantic servers competing for space.  Very, very annoying.  I'm sad to not like this pizza anymore.  I'd say if you love bread more than sauce or cheese, and generally go for pan style, you'll love it.  It's not for me though.",11,5,negative
34,"I wish I could give a 5 for food and 2 for customer service....The hostess station was a HOT MESS when we got there around 7:30 pm on Saturday.  We expected to have a wait, but not a 2.5 hour one!  That just seems like poor management and overall time management!  It made it extremely frustrating to listen to the hostess tell guest after guest 2-2.5 hour wait when I was looking at 3 empty tables within sight of the entrance!  Lucky, we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar and order right from there.  The bartender was working like crazy to not only serve her guests by run the bar for the entire place.  It was quite disappointing to see 2 staff members standing on their phone the ENTIRE time we sat at the bar....how is there a 2.5 hour wait but not all hands on deck?The pizza was a great and we'd go back for more!  CAREFUL....don't over order.  The small was plenty for 2 people!",4,3,positive
35,"I have been wanting to come here for 4 YEARS. Don't be dumb like me and wait that long. My husband and I went in for dinner earlier in the week before a movie at Webster Place. Since it was  a weekday, there was no wait. But I know for sure there is usually a long wait for a  table at high traffic times. We ordered onion rings and a medium sausage pizza. I thought to myself, maybe the hype isn't real. OH IT REAL. The crust of the pizza is so good, it's worth it. For sure try this if you haven't already.  The onion rings we perfect, I like that it's served wit bbq sauce.  I can't wait to go back. The service is quick and the prices are fair.",6,2,positive
36,"Pequod's.  Strange name, delicious pizza.I'm not certain why the whale on the menu is wearing thong underwear on its head, but I do know that the pizza is fantastic.The atmosphere is that of a college pizza/sports bar.  A majority of it's patrons seem to be college students.  I felt like an old geezer, and I'm only 40. This place is extremely busy, and the line was out the door...on a Sunday afternoon.  Thankfully our pizza tour was able to walk right in, as they were expecting us.  I felt bad for the people waiting outside in the sun!Their deep dish has a lighter, airy crust, but very thick.  When you add the cheese and sauce, you get a very unique type of pizza.Oh, and do yourself a favor - EAT ALL OF THE CRUST.  It looks burnt, but that's the best part -  ""carmelized crust.""  It's a layer of cheese that melts together with the crust.  A tiny piece of heaven right there!I probably won't ever be in this neighborhood again, but if I am, I'll definitely drop in!",8,2,positive
37,"Well worth the wait!  Even with the plethora of tables upstairs and downstairs, be prepared to wait awhile.  However, the service is excellent and the deep dish is in a class of its own.  The burnt cheese up the back of the crust just makes this the best place for Chicago pie, hands down.",3,0,positive
38,"By far the best pizza in Chicago! A month ago I met a guy in an Uber we shared in San Diego and directed me to Pequod's staying this is where Chicagoans frequent and boy I'm glad I met him. This was the best pizza I've tried in my 4 visits to Chicago and will only eat pizza there from now on. Decor-it's an old brick building with two floors of dining and a bar on both floors. The walls have a mix of Chicago sports paraphanelia and Chicago history. Tight seating area upstairs and down, and a very small bar upstairs. Service-I sat at the bar, so really can't comment on service, but bar tender was decent and brought me what I asked. Food-Pizza is Phenomenal!!!! Perfectly seasoned with a blend of spices like oregano and garlic. The crust was crisped to perfection and topped with tons of cheese, sausage, and pepperoni's. Garlic cheese bread was also perfection! Simply put this place rocks and is amazing. Beware there are long lines, but that is testament of how good food is. Can't wait to go back!!!",11,0,positive
39,"I am a lover of thin crust!!!Having said that, never ever eat thin crust here..it's sad..and a pathetic excuse for pizza BUT...The deep dish here is SO yummy. I love the sausage here even though I usually avoid sausages (colon cancer and all, blah blah). Simply put, this place is an exception for me. I eat a deep dish pizza with sausage here!! Totes breaking away from my usual preferences. Try it yourself. You might surprise yourself too!",2,5,positive
40,"I visited the Morton Grove location 8 years ago and I absolutely loved it.  I still enjoyed the pizza at this newer Chicago location, but it didn't taste quite as amazing at the one I had at the Morton Grove location.  The crust seemed more burnt than the caramelized crust I remember.  Maybe it's because the Morton Grove location is the original, and the oven used has the special flavor from years of baking pizza. One tip if you plan to eat lunch on a weekday - call in your order.  Then text them when you are 15 minutes away.  They will reserve your seat and your pizza will come out in about 15-20 minutes after you are seated.",3,0,positive
41,"If Lou Malnati's crust got combined with Pequod's topping, it would make the best deep dish pizza. Our group of four waited about an hour to be seated during peak dinner time. Your group should place your pizza order soon after being seated, because the large pizza takes 45 minutes to cook. We ordered the large pizza, added pepperoni, jalapeño, garlic, and meatball. The service was not great. Our waitress rarely came around to check in on us. We had to flag her down and ask for things like a beer or soda refills multiple times. We ended up canceling our pitcher of beer due to the long wait. The second story was not well ventilated and got uncomfortably warm during dinner. Although the toppings were very generous, I did not love the crust at Pequod's. It was too cakey, thick, and dry in my opinion. That combined with the service and long wait made this experience fall short of my expectations.",7,2,negative
42,"I cannot tell you how disappointing my experience at Pequod's was.  Based on all the reviews as well as how many times it's on food shows, I had high expectations.  My husband had been before and kept telling me it wasn't that great, but of course, I needed to try for myself.  The first time, he got deep dish and I was sure that was the reason for his negativity.  We don't like deep dish.So we got thin crust of sausage and garlic.  30 minutes later the pizza comes out and it's covered in cheese and sauce.  The cheese was a little too overpowering and the sauce was very tomato based.  But what I didn't like that much was the skimpiness of sausage (the last 5 pizza slices didn't have any on it), and the crust just wasn't that great.  While the crust was extremely thin on the bottom, it was very doughy on the side.  I also thought the crust would have that caramelized / burntness that the deep dish does.  It didn't.   So we left most of the crust and the last 4-5 slices.  We didn't even feel it was worth the effort to box it up.  That disappointing!On the plus side - we had the Pequod's Salad (romaine, pepperoni, peppers, cucumbers, mozzarella cheese, etc) and Italian Dressing.  This was excellent.  The lg salad was great to split between us and the dressing was so much better than your usual Italian as it was full of spices.Our server was also very good.  Attentive on the drinks and everything.We later found out as we were leaving that they have an extra thin crust where there is less side crust.  I don't remember it on the menu, but even still, we will not be back to try it.",10,3,negative
43,"First off, we were hyped up a lot before coming here! We were told that this was essentially the best pizza in Chicago. So off the bat we had really high standards of this place. We walked in, and there was a sigh that said the wait time was about 40 mins for pizza AFTER we were seated. At this point we decided to just put in a to go order since they said that would only take 40-45 minutes. I personally think it was overrated. I mean it wasn't bad pizza but it definitely wasn't the best pizza in Chicago. Actually I am not sure if I would call it pizza, it was more like pizza bread. We got a pan pizza, half cheese and half sausage. It looked more like a deep dish pizza when it came out of the box. It was a think and crispy crust (actually the crust was kind of charred/ burned). Super tasty, but again, tasted like good pizza bread, not pizza. I am willing to try a thin crust and dine in next time but not sure I will ever wait 2+ hours to eat here!",7,2,negative
44,"I honestly expected so much more from a place that is this hyped up. Would definitely prefer any other deep dish place (Gino's East, Lou's and Giordano's) over Pequod's.Where to even begin? First off, the service is terrible. We called at 4:00PM on a Sunday for pickup was told it would take 50 minutes to prepare the food. We arrived at 5:20 due to bad traffic. I went inside and paid and was told my name would be called when the food was ready. I expected the food to come out right away since it had been 80 minutes since I called but nope, it took 10 minutes to just get part of our order (the soup and salad). Then we waited another 10 minutes to get the two large pizzas that we ordered, but we were still missing our cheesy garlic bread. The lady bringing us our food seem to have no idea about what we ordered. After waiting another 5 minutes for our garlic bread, they forgot the marinara sauce (which costs extra $0.65 btw). So basically we had to wait almost two hours after we ordered to receive our entire order.Now the food. We ordered two large pizzas, one with pep, bacon, peppers and mushrooms, and one with sausage, pineapple and spinach. They completely neglected to put pineapple on one pizza and put pepperoni instead. Also, each topping is $3, making each pizza around $30-$32. The pizza was basically an inch thick bread with toppings and lacked sauce. They also put an obnoxious amount of pepperoni on the pizza, some areas were 4 slices thick, making the pizza taste extremely heavy and salty. The crust was also black, burnt, and hard to chew.The pequods salad ($10) is probably one of the worst salads I've ever had. The menu didn't list any of the ingredients in the salad so I didn't know what to expect. The salad contained old wilted lettuce, and had pepperoni and sliced cheese on top, making it basically a pizza except with crappy lettuce as the base instead of bread. The tomatoes were borderline rotten, they were bitter and brown inside. I also ordered a vinaigrette dressing, but received two sauce containers of olive oil and two sauce containers of balsamic vinegar; did they expect me to make my own dressing? Usually vinaigrette comes premixed with seasoning. The cheesy garlic bread was basically baguette sliced in half with a sliced of cheese on top. By the time we got home, the bread was cold and hard and had to be warmed up again. TLDR; pretty much every aspect of our experience was extremely disappointing. No idea why people tolerate their service and food",7,12,negative

46,"This place was a BIG disappointment. We arrived on a friday night and they estimated the wait to be 1hr 40 min.. okay if this place had that many reviews than it must be worth it. So we waited about 2 hours before we got seated. We ordered the appetizer sampler that came out fairly quick. It had jalapeno poppers, (i thought it was too salty) fried zuccinni (not bad), and fried mushroom (ehh) My friend got the iltalian beef with cheese and peppers, i thought it was good, thats why i gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. The beef was moist and juicy and the sandwich had a lot of good flavor.They estimated the wait for our food to be another hour.. we waited around 45 minutes for our food to finally come.My boyfriend an i got the medium pizza with sausage. I was so disappointment, the pizza didnt taste good at all to me. i didnt even finish half of a slice. I think ive had better pizza at Blaze pizza or even dominos. The crust had a weird taste and texture to it, like the crust was really crumbly and just wasnt good. This is the longest ive ever waited for at a resturant and i really wish i didnt.",8,6,negative
47,"My sister used to live in Chicago, and being from NY, she was super excited to experience their pizza.  I don't remember the name of the place she took us to for deep dish, but none of us liked it --- the sauce, the crust, the cheese... none of it.  I want to say it was Giordano's, but I'm not 100% sure.Fast forward to now, I returned to Chicago for a festival and was willing to give pizza another chance.  I tried Lou Malnati's, and while I liked the sauce and cheese, I was not a fan of the crust at all.  But then after the festival I decided to seek this place out... and everything changed.  First of all, there was a mob outside of the restaurant waiting to be seated.  Since I was by myself, I was happy to squeeze through, go inside and find a seat at the bar.  As I passed by the hostess's podium, I saw a sign that said pizzas ordered at the time would take 60 minutes.  That's a nice thing to know, instead of being shocked as you wait for your food.Anyways, I found a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine as I waited for pizza.  I believe it did take about an hour, and when it came... it was pipin' hot in a pan.  The person who brought it to me cut me a slice and put it on a plate.  I had to wait for it to cool down before I could pick it up.  As a matter of fact, it was still a tad loose so I knifed & forked it.  I asked for pepperoni and green peppers, but I did not expect it to be huge chunks of peppers nor for there to be loads and loads of pepperoni.  That combined with their rather sweet sauce and perfectly caramelized and textured crust was....AWESOME!!!Chicago pizza has been redeemed for me and it's all thanks to Pequod's.   I would gladly come back.  Be warned: do NOT come with a big party.  I get the feeling you'd be waiting a long time if you did.  If you do though, just be prepared.",12,2,positive
48,"A deep dish pizza unlike anything I've eaten before.Recommend by a couple of local Chicago friends, we decided to stop in. Upon entering, there's a written sign showing you the expected wait for your pizza. When we walked in it showed an estimated 40 minute wait. Our party was 5 & the server recommended a large pizza but to be honest a medium would've been sufficient.I can't compare their deep dish to any pizza, I've eaten before. It tasted more similar to a gourmet lasagna & it was excellent. The crust was the highlight and the toppings (pepperoni, sausage) were excellent as well. Overall it was very good but not great. A unique tasting pizza.",7,0,positive
49,"I love Pequod's, and always recommend it to visitors looking for good deep dish. It's my second favorite deep dish in the city (after Art of Pizza), but hands down has my favorite crust.

Said our pizza would be replaced but we are the ones that had to ask 25 minutes later where pizzas were then we finally just got up and walked out!  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  In total we wasted 3 hours and ended up getting pizza at Lou Malinati's.",2,2,negative

52,"Real Chicagoans know: this is the best Chicago pie there is. They've been using the same pans for like 100 years, so every pizza tells the story of pizzas past. The way the cheese caramelizes around the edges is just perfection, I don't know how else to describe it.",3,0,positive
53,"After doing a search on Yelp for the best pizza in Chicago, we knew we had to give Pequod's a try. Staying downtown, the walk was too far, so we took a Lyft (which was a quick ride). We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. Upon entry, it seemed a bit crowded, so I was pleased when we were led upstairs to a much more open space. We were directed to a high-top table and our server quickly welcomed us. Now, this place is all about the pizza, so I will get to the point. It was interesting that the pie was not a traditional Chicago-style pizza, but a deep dish pizza, so the main difference was the crust. That fact threw me a bit at first, but the pizza was tremendously satisfying. The pepperoni was thick and spicy, the sauce flavorful, and the cheese perfectly melted and rich. We ordered a small. It had four pieces, but they were substantial, so between the two of us, we ate three and took one to go. Our server was super friendly and attentive (not too much attention, not too little attention, but the attention was just right). If you are visiting Chicago, I recommend venturing out of downtown proper to taste the deliciousness of Pequod's.",14,1,positive
54,"4.5 stars. Yum! Tried Pequod's after it was recommended to us by a few people. Arrived at 11:15am on a Sunday morning and there were maybe 4 people in the place - wanted to be sure we got there early to get a seat. We had done the priority seating on their website the day before, but turns out we didn't need it. Since there was plenty of room, we decided to sit at the bar. We ordered a small pizza (this for my husband and I) with sausage, garlic onions, tomatoes, and extra cheese and sauce (as recommended by fellow Yelpers). I'm definitely glad we got the extra cheese - I'm not sure I'd get the extra sauce if I had to do it again (I'd also definitely forego the tomatoes, definitely unnecessary, especially with the extra sauce). The crust - ooooh, that crust. Just as good as everyone says. The roasted garlic was amazing, the cheese nice and gooey. Overall...it was like pizza lasagna - and I mean that very positively. Really delicious, and filling. The small was perfect for the two of us (we're from out of town, so no place to store leftovers). The bartender was honest and said it takes about 40 minutes per pizza, so we split a cesar salad...if I had to do it all over again I wouldn't have ordered that, I would have just waited. Why not 5 stars? It's a bit expensive (I mean, it's pizza...and I wish there'd been a few more pieces of sausage). And there weren't very many beers on tap. I know their focus is pizza, but a few more beers (and local beers) would have been nice to see.",12,3,positive

56,Only the long wait for a table keeps a fifth star from appearing in this review.  We were in town for a wedding and wanted to sample what Chicago calls pizza.  We were directed fortunately to Pequod's and were not disappointed.  To cut our wait time we ate at the bar.  Our bar tender was very helpful as we discussed our ordering options.  It's a fun environment and the pizza was delicious.,5,1,positive
57,"After a full day of being at the United Center for my first time in Chicago, and obstinately not eating much, I obviously had to get myself some deep dish pizza. Pequod's was highly recommended to me, and I got there past midnight on a Friday night.Since I was there at a relatively odd hour, getting a spot was a breeze. The ambience is similar neighborhood friendly dive bar but with the aroma of pizzas instead of beer. To my dismay though, the only pizzas served here were pan pizzas - the horror!On clarifying with the waitress though, it seems like the main difference between a deep dish and their pan pizzas is the fact that Pequod's makes them in a skillet, resulting in their (famous) blackened edges. I ended up going with a simple if slightly oddball combo of olives and jalepenos.It had all the hallmarks of a deep dish pizza: 40min to make; a fork and knife needed to eat it and being absolutely stuffed after about 2 slices. It was absolutely delicious! The ingredients tasted so fresh, and the balance of cheese:toppings:crust seemed perfect; with nothing overwhelming the pizza. I love my Brooklyn style pizza, but Pequod's is right up there with the best I've ever had and I can't wait for another trip to Chicago to have it!",12,1,positive
58,"I've been to Chicago twice. Over the course of those two trips, I have had Lou Malnati's, Giodarno's, and Pequod's on this most recent trip. I will rank them accordingly: 1) Giodarno's2) Pequod's3) Malnati's On to Pequod's deep dish. We walked in right when it opened, so there wasn't a wait and got seated fairly quickly. We ordered and customized toppings (peppers, onions, and sausage). Pequod's is well known for their caramelized crust so I was very excited to try that. When the pizza, came it smelled delicious and looked so good. Flavors were very good, but I honestly was not a fan of the caramelized crust on some parts. It was kind of burned, so it added this unpleasant taste when eating it. We also ordered fried mushrooms as apps, also good, but could skip especially if you get deep dish. Worth checking out if you're in the area, but it's kinda tough because it's not super convenient to get to.",11,4,positive
59,"So before my trip to Chicago I was doing A LOT of research. I've been to the Chi a lot now. But I never really cared about who was the best deep dish in town. I was only interested in experiencing it and the Chi Town lifestyle, if you know what I mean. So this time I wanted to know who had the best in town. During my research this place kept on popping up. I've already tried a lot of the other top rated places so wanted to go here. Food Network also rated it the second best pizza in the Nation! So I had to give it a try.When I went I ordered a large pep and sausage pan (deep dish) w/ extra cheese. It came out in the normal deep dish cast iron pan. And you could tell just by looking at it what time of experience I was in for. It looked so good. When I finally started eating it I fell in love. No joke, it's that good. All the flavors go so well together. The sauce was perfect and everything came together. I love the darkened caramelized cheese ring around the edges. You won't really get that anywhere else and it's kind of a Peqouds ""thing"". This was my first deep dish with thick crust. But it was so good. It was cooked perfect. The pizza was steaming hot and I still couldn't even let it sit a second before taking more bites. I will say this I by far my favorite Deep Dish. Giordano's what? Lou Malnati's who?... never heard of em..... This is my go to spot in my favorite city now. No game or gimmicks, you gotta go if you never been. This pizza is LIT.The place is very small. And I heard that it normally has lines around the corner. So I made sure to get here early before opening to get a spot. I'd suggest that for anyone that comes from out of town. The inside looks like a plain regular bar or pub. Which makes it even better. They don't have that corporate feel that the other places have. Their menu is basic, like super basic. And that just adds to the whole ambiance of this place. No flashing likes and smoke and mirrors. They are about their pizza, and that's what on show here.The service was nice. Nothing too great. Just average. But that's fine. As long as it is not negative. Everything was on time and quick. We had our drinks refilled when we needed them and everything. Overall this place has set the standard for Chicago deep dish for me. I was giving other pizza places high ratings. But not I gotta re think the whole thing. This place is a 10/10 and everything else falls under it. That's just #Facts. This is definitely my new go to when in the Windy City. I'd recommend this to anybody that. Tourist or not.  Wish I could give it 6 stars honestly.",25,5,positive
60,"Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Crust was buttery, sauce was perfect and the cheese was piled high. The wait time to get seated was not bad at all. The cooking time for the pizza was about 1 hour if not longer which is why I'm not giving them 5 stars. They need to figure out a better system to get the food out quicker. An hour is just way too long.",3,1,positive
61,"This was our first stop on an incredible Pizza Tour of Chicago that we took on a work trip recently. I have seriously been dreaming about this pizza ever since.The place feels kind of divey, but they are doing some transcendental magic in the kitchen. Our tour guide explained that they add mozzarella in the cast iron pan to help create their incredible caramelized, crunchy, unforgettable crust. I am such a sucker for burnty cheese, and their toppings are as incredibly well-made as their signature crest. Be sure to order the Italian sausage.I really intended to save more room for the last stop, a deep dish spot that I expected to like the best, but Pequod's was truly the stand out of the tour. After finishing my own piece, I scavenged off of some of my coworkers plates who hadn't had room to finish their whole piece. Even our gluten-free gal was picking the cheesy edge off of other people's pieces so that she could participate vicariously in this incredible pizza.I so highly recommend this spot and guarantee I'll be back again and again!",12,2,positive
62,"So a disclaimer before you read this review: I'm from the east coast and really enjoy NY style thin crust pizza. The place was packed for a Wednesday but there was a Cubs game in the afternoon and a lot of Dodgers fans were in town looking to try deep dish. The wait took about 20 minutes since it was only 2 of us but the pizza took over an hour. Therefore, I would definitely recommend ordering an appetizer so you're not starving when the food comes out. We got garlic bread that was fairly average - nothing to write home about. Next, we go a medium sized pizza for 2 people and had leftovers so the size was not a problem. We ordered sausages and peppers and came out looking great. Maybe I am just not a fan but the inside of the pizza had a lot of bread and not the cheese and sauce I was expecting or envisioning. I will say the crust is unique as it is completely made of cheese and reminds me of the burnt edges of lasagna so that was the best part in my opinion. We had leftovers that we ate the next dya and quite frankly, that tasted better than the fresh slice. Overall a good experience and environment but still like NY style pizza better.",11,0,negative
63,"If you can't decide where to get deep dish pizza in Chicago, give this place a try. It's not the Chicago deep dish I remember having as a kid, but it's pretty damn good.

It takes about 40 minutes for them to cook the pizza but we seemed to have only waited 20. If you're driving, there's plenty of street parking nearby. I got here around 12:30pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. Although I do have to dock some points for the state of the table.

65,"We were sitting quietly in a booth on the second story of Pequod's near midnight. Princess Carewee was to my left, configuring her camera after a full day of adventure. Across from us is our mercurial friend, Kent24, fully wrapped in Giants attire. We were quiet. Battered from a long day of eating, drinking, baseball, and more eating, we had to travel by foot to this popular Pizza place. There was little energy left for idle conversations.By contrast, the restaurant was loud and lively, even at this late hour. The walls were illuminated with neon lights of commercial beer logos and Chicago sports team. Against the dim lighting, the décor reminds one more of a sports bar than a pizzeria. But maybe the two are the same here in the Midwest. The menu was a single laminated piece of literature. It dutifully reminded us that Pequod was famous for its caramelized crust, or its ""darkened edge"". Between the three of us, we had no idea how this would taste, but were in firm agreement that it must be awesome. The menu also listed out all the toppings that we can choose from. The usual suspects were all present: Spinach, Sausage, Mushroom, Extra Ch---""Extra Cheese."" I broke our silence with a wide-eyed whisper. Kent24 was not having it. Still feeling the effects of our hearty dinner not so many hours ago, the proposition of adding another layer of fat to an already heavy fourth-meal must have sounded ludicrous. But the thing you have to know about Kent24 is that it's never a 'hard no.' As a matter of fact, the 'No' is merely an invitation to strengthen the proposal of your idea - to describe the insanity, to explain the improbability, and to illustrate the grandeur of its effects. Kent24's 'No' is merely the demand that you verbalize the ""Lit-Ness"" that is your idea and immortalize the awesomeness in words.""Fine, get the extra cheese."" Kent24 conceded, inevitably I may add.Thus, I would not be doing our gluttonous gluttony justice if I do not chronicle our pizza experience to you as I have imagined it to Kent24 just moments before our glory.The server arrived at our table with a circular pan. Sitting within the pan were the dear and familiar colors of a midnight pizza. The crimson red of the classic pepperoni and the radiant green of the bell peppers clashed violently against a wobbly backdrop of golden mozzarella. Fiery red tomato sauces burst through pockets of the melted surface and splattered on any and all nearby darkened sausages and olives. All the colors glistened under a thin layer of oil, accentuating this visual spectacle. Enclosed within the pan was chaos and beauty, and it was announcing its presence ever so loudly with its violent aroma. My heart began racing. I knew Kent24's was too. After juggling our phones with our trembling hands, we had the cameras in position to capture this moment. Finally, a LITsperience worthy to share on our social media outlets, guaranteed to extract those coveted little hearts from our followers.The server, standing by us this whole time, motioned politely for us to wait. He wore a slight smirk on his face and his brown eyes exude the type of confidence that we had only seen in a meme... he did not speak, but we heard him loud and clear.""This isn't even my final form.""The metal slicer clanged against the pan and in one swift motion, raised a slice of the pie into the night sky. The sight was majestic --- no, it was divine. In its ascent, small pieces of sausages separated from its body and fell gloriously from the skies. The streams of mozzarella stretched with the crust and into the gates of heaven. Each golden strand looked as if it were a celestial ray of light breaking through the clouds and onto Earth, blessing the taste buds of devout eaters.  In truth, neither Kent24 nor I finished more than one slice of that pizza. As its appearance suggests, it was as heavy as it was filling. We were punished for our greed and gluttony as we had no microwave in our lodgings and had to watch more than half of our deep dish go to waste. But it was worth it. Pequod's Deep Dish was the most amazing piece of pizza I have ever witnessed and I will sin a hundred times to eat that forbidden pie again. We left Pequod's with our bellies full of pizza and a night full of memories. The decision to go with extra cheese - against the better judgment of our appetite, diet, and/or health - was the right decision. Years from now, Kent24 and I will be throwing back some Coors Light (Kent went to Colorado ONCE) and we will remember this night in Chicago. We will reminisce about Wrigley, we will laugh about the LC, and we will talk about how we once saw a slice of deep dish pizza soared into the cosmos. LITness is forever.SIDE STORYAs many of you may know, Princess Carewee is a plant based homie. Pequod was able to accommodate her with a no-cheese deep dish. The crust was egg-free - we asked. It looked earthly compared to our pie, but she loved it. So yeah, vegan friendly!",28,19,positive

So your pizza is authentic great tasting food. Their sausage cannot be rivaled. The crust is authentic Italian and has a flavor that enhances the sauces.  There is no best ingredients to their pizzas.

68,"It's quite a common thing for a business to, in one fashion or another, claim to be the best. Best in the city, best in the world, best in show; the claim has all but lost its meaning- with one exception: the customers. You can read reviews, take into consideration the opinions of critics, etc. But when you get down what really counts and matters, it's the opinion of the paying customer that matters. And when you hear ""best"" being used to describe a place over and over by multiple customers, it's best to pay attention.For weeks before visiting Chicago, we had been told by ex-pats and friends alike, that the place to get the best pan pizza in all of Chicago, was Pequad's.And you know what? It really is.Without exaggeration or embellishment, Pequod's is the gold standard of deep dish pizza in all of Chicago (maybe the whole world, for that matter). The crust is thick, crisp, and not doughy or undercooked. The cheese edge is perfectly caramelized, without being burnt. The toppings are thick and  plenty, no matter how many or few you choose. On average, one person can usually eat one, or two slices. So come as a group, or plan on bringing home leftovers (re-heat in a pan or iron skillet, if you do).Now, there are a couple of downsides, that everyone should be aware of, before going in. For starters, on busy days/nights (especially in game nights), and seating is first come-first served, with a long waiting time (don't worry- it's worth it). So, if you can, request a table at least twenty four hours in advance.The other thing to keep in mind, is when it's slammed, your order may be a bit heavy on the sauce. So, when ordering, be sure to ask to go easy on the marinara. Make no mistake about it, Pequad's stands alone. They're incomparable to any other place. They are well worth going out of your way for. I can not recommend them enough. What they serve does not just feed the body, but the soul. But don't take my word for it, try them yourself. You can thank me later.",16,4,positive
69,We got here right as it opened so we didn't have to wait long. We were quickly seated in a booth and the server brought over waters right after. We opted for the classic cheese pizza. It took awhile to make but all deep dish pizzas take long. The pizza itself was okay at best. The sauce was very basic and the layer of cheese was not as thick as I had hoped for. We did enjoy the caramelized crispy crust but that was about it. We've heard such good things about this place but we're very underwhelmed. We might try it again in s few months.,6,0,negative
70,"I came here on a Friday at 1pm and the place was relatively empty. We were seated immediately. The restaurant was spacious enough to have luggages. They allow you to call and order your pizza ahead of time because it takes about 45 mins to make. You can also ""reserve"" your spot on a waiting list a day before you plan on coming. See their website for details. We started with jalapeno poppers which were good. Tasted like typical bar food. For pizza, I got the lunch special personal pan (available mon-fri until 3pm) with half mushrooms and half meatballs. The pizza came piping hot. To be completely honest it was just okay. Contrary to what other yelpers say, mine came with more than enough cheese but VERY little sauce. The pizza was majority dough which I wouldn't mind if it wasn't so bland. The meatballs were flavorful but too salty. The sauce was nice. I loved the burnt cheese on the sides. The bottom of the pizza was rock hard. Free soda refills was a plus. Service needs improvement. They seemed understaffed. This was my first time trying deep dish. I'm from NYC and I think I prefer thin slices. Or maybe I just haven't had good deep dish.",13,2,negative
71,"When in Chicago, we had to try deep dish.  After reading reviews on Yelp and other websites and talking with a few people - we decided to try deep dish here for spot that we served a less touristy deep dish than you'd get near the Loop. The place is sort off the beaten path and the L train and is an old school dive bar with dark lightening so wasn't sure what to expect. We were seated right away and saw the sign to expect a 40 minute wait for pizza but it was sort of an odd time (5pm on a Monday) as we were expecting a much longer wait. We ordered some beers and mozzarella sticks and settled in to await the pizza. Not a ton of other options besides pizza and bar food FYI. Yes, it met the hype! The crust was doughy with a nice sweet tomato sauce and not a ton of cheese, it was thick and delicious especially the caramelized crust. I was stuffed after eating my first slice of small pizza but had to eat the second slice.  With so many reviews, I guess the secret is out where to grab food Chicago deep dish!",4,2,positive
72,"The service at Pequod's is absolutely pathetic.  The pizza is amazing, and I've gone back half a dozen times despite the service because of the pizza, but our experience last night was the last straw.  There's too many good pizza places in Chicago to warrant sitting through this kind of chaos.My husband and I went on a Tuesday night at 6 pm and ordered 1 medium, thin crust pizza and a garlic bread.  The sign did say it was 40 minute cook time for pizza, which we were prepared for, and the restaurant wasn't overly busy at the time.  After waiting for an hour, we had NO garlic bread, NO pizza, meanwhile two other tables large tables (one with 3 deep dish, and one with one) were served before us.  We told the waitress we had a 7:10 movie across the street, and she said our pizza was 5 minutes away.  15 minutes later and we still had no food, while others were getting their appetizers and pizza.  We decided to walk out.  It was absolutely abysmal service.  Had it been the first time, we would have given it a pass, but this was at least the 5th or 6th time that Pequod's took insanely long to serve us.  Don't waste your time - there's better pizza places in Chicago.",3,3,negative
73,"Being my first time in Chicago I HAD to get a deep dish pizza. This place came highly recommended by virtually every Uber driver, so that is how I ended up here. Upon entering the establishment the hostess was extremely friendly and conversational, especially when she found out we were from out of town and having deep dish pizza for the first time. However, I cannot say the same for our server. Perhaps she was just having an ""off day"", but I found her to be quite rude and unfriendly. She acted like she would rather be doing anything else than to be waiting on us.To start out we ordered the mozz sticks, as we were informed it was one of their best sellers next to the garlic knots, and I can say they did not disappoint. Now being that I was in town on business, and leftovers would be less than convenient, I opted for the personal sized pizza. In hindsight not sure it was the best way to experience deep dish because it is not served in a pan and was quite messy as such. This particular place touts their unique caramelized crust and I have to say it did not disappoint. I ordered mine with meatball, onions and black olives. The meatballs were very tasty but the onions were not cooked enough to my liking. I also prefer more cheese on my pizza, I had a hard time finding the cheese to be honest. All in all I can't say I'm a fan of the deep dish, though I have nothing to compare it to. However I'll stick with my thin crust pizza, less carbs anyhow",10,6,negative
74,You know what's amazing going to a place that doesn't change a damn thing and is still a hit. From living in Chicago 22 years then moving to the burbs to start a family I just had to bring them here. Granted we brought our 10 month old (he's loud but not bitchy) here last night great idea because there was seating up stairs which is the best spot. Nice relaxing still has TVs. Pizza is amazing the sauce is the best in the city the crust and dough is complex yet fluffy. If you crave pizza with a layer of toppings stop by grab a pitcher and relax.,5,3,positive
75,Amazing deep dish. My Chicago friend took me here as they say it's better than the normal touristy deep dish places. So worth the long wait and I can't wait to come back again.,2,0,positive
76,This was my first place I've ever had Chicago style deep dish pizza and it was amazing. I would recommend everyone to come and try this place. It's custom made so you can add whatever you want but just know it does take about atleast 45min for any style of pizza. The service here was great everyone was very friendly. Definitely will be back when I'm in town.,4,0,positive
77,I came here during lunch time in the middle of the week and  the restaurant had a decent amount of people inside. Our server was quick to take drink orders and make ask if we had any questions about the menu. I ended up getting the lunch special which is a personal cheese pizza and a drink for 5 bucks. This is an amazing deal for quality pizza. They said it could take 45 minutes for the pizza to cook but it only ended up being like 25-30 minutes. The pizza itself has nice and crispy crust with a good sauce and plenty of cheese. I had heard a lot about Pequod's and I wasn't disappointed. Next time I'm back in town I would definitely come back and try some of their other pizzas.,5,1,positive
78,"Since moving to the Windy City I been looking for the deep dish of all deep dishes. We got here and had giordarnos pizza. It was alright but nothing to write home about. Next we tried Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. That hit the spot but I felt like it there was something else out there for me to try. After searching high and low, I saw other yelp reviews that Pequod's was the spot to go. After exploring downtown we decided to dabble in this pizza. Boy oh boy I'm so glad we did! The pizza was fire! But the crust stole the show! That crispy burnt cheese was it for me! We ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza with garlic. Parking sucks around the area and there will be a wait, especially after a Cubs game. I won't dock them a star for that. Too bad I live far as hell to eat this pizza because if I lived close, I would eat this every day! I will be back if I'm in the area!",2,4,positive
79,"If you're looking for authentic deep dish pizza, look no further! Got a tip from a local to skip Lou's and Giordano's and get pizza from Pequod's! Indeed they were right. Out of curiosity we tried Lou's and it was awful, I would not recommended it to anyone. Pequod's was the real deal! We got a medium pan pizza with cheese with extra sauce and at first bite, we knew that we were in Chicago! Buttery crust, just the right amount of cheese, and flavorful, homemade sauce.We were staying on N. Michigan Avenue and we realized Pequod's was about 4 miles away so we called and they said they delivered to where we were staying. The girl on the phone was extremely helpful. She told us to order 1 hr and 20 minutes in advance to take into account the cook and delivery time. When the pizza arrived, it was still hot! For a small delivery fee, this was such a better option than taking an Uber there and back.",7,1,positive
80,"Everyone has told me that Pequod's does a great deep dish pizza. When I mentioned I was going to Chicago, Chicagoans unanimously said I had to stop by Pequod's. I'm definitely glad I went, and I had a good time, but I guess deep dish just isn't my thing. Here goes the review:We stopped by Pequod's in the late afternoon on a Friday. We were prepared to wait, but got lucky and were seated right away. We were informed that the wait for pizza would be ~45 minutes; I think it ended up being a little less. We went for the medium deep dish with spinach and sausages. The pizza is so bread-y (in the words of my friend, it felt like ""90% bread"") that though the pizza didn't look large, it was massively filling. The fillings were generous (so much cheese, so much sauce, basically an entire layer of spinach and copious amounts of sausage) and very liquid-y, but the crust held up well to all that moisture. That being said, it was a fork-and-knife pizza experience.Our favorite part of the pizza was the sausage, which had a prominent fennel flavor and a juicy bite. The cheese had that good stretchy pull, but was on the bland side, and we needed a good sprinkle of red pepper flakes to add some flavor. And I know that deep dishes are about that thick crust, but there was so. much. bread.Service was about what you'd expect for a busy, pub-style sort of place - they took our order in a timely manner, but it was difficult to flag down staff for water refills and red pepper flakes (which should be available at all tables). Prices were fair; we each paid ~$11, including tip. I'm glad we stopped by and experienced deep dish, and I can appreciate that there's something comforting about a pan filled with bread, tomato sauce, assorted toppings, and melted cheese. But ultimately, Pequod's didn't win me over, and as far as deep dish goes, I don't have any burning desire to eat it again any time soon.",19,3,positive
81,"Visited this place for lunch around 3pm on a Saturday. Although the sign showed that their was a 45 min wait for the pizza, ours arrived in 25 min which was nice.We ordered house salad which was totally average. Only ordered it to get some nutrients. We shared a personal pan pizza (which is the smallest size) given we had a heavy breakfast. Our toppings included onions, garlic, mushrooms and black olives. Overall the pizza was good and very filling. But thought it wasn't the best pizza we had in Chicago.Overall worth trying if the waiting time is less than 45 min.",3,0,positive
82,"2 yrs is not enough to get to know all the deliciousness Chicago has to offer unless you're lucky enough to have experienced company around you. That is basically how I came across Pequod's. I'm personally not a crazy, salivating at the thought of a deep dish fan and have only had my occasional Giordanos or Lou's. So, when I was told how awesome this joint is I was honestly not expecting a lot. However, when I got to try their risky, on the edge, slightly burnt buttery crust topped with the amazing lava of sauce and veggies- It was quite a surprise. We had ordered on phone before heading to Pequod's so the service was fairly quick. Once seated, the ambience was very casual, like a neighborhood bar- food joint.  Servers were sweet, guided us well and refilled our drinks on time. I've heard this place gets crazy packed on weekends and rush hours so call beforehand. We got lucky with the parking but it's usually on a busy street. Overall very pleased, will return and will recommend to all my tourist friends in search of that good ol' deep dish.",13,3,positive
83,"Personally, the best pizza in Chicago. Not, perhaps a ""real"" deep dish... but in a pan, with caramelized, delicious crusts, nice layer of cheese (if you're expecting a lot of cheese like on other deep dish pizzas filled half with tomato sauce and half with cheese, you should ask for an extra topping of cheese) and filled with fresh, yummy ingredients. While searching for deep dish, I've been to the famed Lou Malnati's  and Giordanos but was never wowed. I thought it was just that I don't really like deep dish. It is too big, too soggy, too salty and too tomatoyee. Well, wether Pequod's is real deep dish or its fixed version, this is one pizza I like! It's definitely not NY style thin or Costco pizza (which I like, btw, but I wouldn't say they are better than Pequod's as some reviewer mentioned... at least personally, this here is definitely worth it), and also crusty and filled with yummy ingredients. I like that the tomato sauce is not overpowering. On this last visit, I thought they had skimped out on cheese though. The last several times I've been, the cheese was oozing out while the server was serving up the pizza, but this time, it definitely stayed in place, and I could taste it less. I hope it was just a temporary hiccup rather than a permanent cost saving tactic. Their $4.95 lunch specials come with a personal size pizza and a drink. Some years ago, it was with a beer but that's changed to a fountain drink. I really like this personal size... Feels like more caramelized deliciousness. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and garlic, and they definitely loaded it up. We also shared the app combo. Glad we did, since we were hungry and the pizza takes 40 minutes to cook. Yes, either order ahead (I'm not sure you can, actually, but I should next time I go), or be ready to wait. The appetizer combo came with 4 pieces of each item so the 4 of us in our party didn't have to fight over anything. So sorry Lou, sorry Giordano... Pequod's is where I go!",16,2,positive
84,"Love their deep dish here! Also love their personal sized pizza lunch special. I've tried one other deep dish pizza in Chicago, and I must say I love Pequod's much more.The pizza will take a little while to bake, but the crunchy crust and crisp cheese edge is worth it! Also not too bready and packed with flavor.",4,0,positive
85,"The wait was about an hour on Sunday when we arrived at 6pm for a party of 4.  They give you a pager to page you when your table is ready.  Except they didn't page us and gave our table away by accident. We checked up on them and they gave us the next table.We started with a house salad which was a complete joke for $5.  It was super tiny and just loaded with croutons. We got a large pan crust with pepperoni, sausage, jalapeños and garlic.  45 mins later, it was ready. The crust was crispy but still doughy on the inside; really thick crust, truly deep dish.  What was really good was the crust had melted cheese that became crispy. I managed two slices but mostly everyone else only ate one slice.Our server was not very tentative and we had to flag her down multiple times to get the soda refilled, get utensils, or and cancel the beer she forgot to get us while we were already half way through our meal.The restaurant is in need of maintenance as their ac couldn't not keep up with the occupancy.  The intake vent was very dusty and some of the ac was dripping. I'm not even sure what their kitchen looks like. Only thing about this place  is that it's different from the rest of the pizza places in town. I don't think it's worth it. I'm also not a deep dish guy.",6,4,negative
86,"People have strong, opposing opinions on deep dish and this just didn't do the trick for me. Pequod's intentionally is very crust heavy, which to me loses all the flavor from the sausage and cheese. It was just too much bread. Other than the pizza - the service was good. We went on a Friday night and only had a 35 min wait and were able to wait in their sister bar. My personal preference is for Lou Malnati's, so I don't think I'll be choosing to go back here",2,1,negative
87,I love Pequod's! Some of the best deep dish pizza in the city. I think the crust is perfect. I like the deep dish with mushrooms and spinach. I also have had the pesto pasta and the pequods salad which is so good. It is totally worth the wait! But if you do not want to wait then I would recommend going at an off time. Definitely a great place to take out of town guests or people that really love pizza!!!,9,0,positive
88,Super crunchy crust Better to add giardiniera for a little spice. :) The wait is about 30 mins. But worth it.,1,0,positive
89,"The reviews don't lie. The pizza is fantastic. The crust is crispy, charred in some places, thick and substantial. Toppings are generous and large size - meaning when we ordered green peppers, they were thick slices. When we ordered Italian sausage, it was big flavorful pieces. Wait time is what it is. Pequod's is simply too popular to keep the crowds away. Call in your order ahead of time and when you arrive and are seated, then the original 40 minute cooking time will be reduced to 20 minutes. Appetizers are small in my opinion. We had the zucchini slices and it was barely enough for 4 people. Everyone has a favorite pizza joint. This is mine. And I've come from out of town twice to eat here because it's THAT good. If you're a major cheese lover, Pequod's won't be for you because their specialty is the crust. They don't drown their pizzas in cheese.",7,0,positive
90,"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, on par with Giordano's in my opinion.  The front of the building is small, and upon stepping inside I thought the space was tiny.  But there is a second floor and it telescopes back, plenty of room, but show up earlier than later to have a shorter wait time.The pan pizza will take ~45 min to cook, so start with some drinks and appetizers.  The garlic bread and marinara sauce was large, but not especially flavorful, get it if you want but also try other things on the menu.  The pizza itself is why everyone comes to Pequod's and it meets the hype.  The crust on the pan pizza is caramelized in a way that Lou's tries, but Pequod's expertly accomplishes.  The crust adds an extra dimension to the pizza that Lou's or Giordano's cannot match.  The crust is thicker at Pequod's than other places, but the topping to crust ratio is appropriate. The ingredients on the pizza are also top notch, the sausage was flavorful and the basil aromatic after cooking.  The waiters do serve the pizza for you, and do so aggressively so I didn't get a photo of the whole pizza.",3,2,positive
91,Pequod's is hands down my favorite deep dish pizza. I would not recommend the thin crust. I love the burnt cheese on the edges. I get extra cheese because I'm a cheese lover and they don't use as much as I'm accustomed to on a deep dish pizza.,4,0,positive
92,"We came to Pequod's after I ran the Wisconsin marathon, and it was probably the best decision we could've made. We got a medium pizza with sausage and pepperoni-- the sausage chunks were huge and they loaded the pizza with pepperoni slices. I ate half and my boyfriend ate the other half, and we were stuffed. Everything about this pizza was perfect! I also loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. It seemed like the perfect college town pizza place. Tons of seating also, we were expecting to have to wait when we first entered but we very quickly got seated on the second floor. Good selection of beer on draft, small selection of wine; we asked about a cocktail menu but they only have the basic liquors and no menu. Not a problem to me, beer goes perfectly with beer!",6,0,positive

95,"Super dive bar-y style pizza joint. With both an upstairs and a downstairs, it was much larger than I anticipated, and insanely crowded. I appreciated that they did an amazing job helping us to party plan. Everything from taking our 20 person reservation to discussing bill breakdown to pre-ordering was above and beyond. Our service was attentive throughout and everything came out quickly and promptly (trust me when I say order ahead, or you'll be hangry waiting 60 minutes for your pizza!). Personal pizza preference for me is the thinner the crust, the better, and their thin crust did not disappoint! Don't fret if you're not a fan of deep dish because this is a great option. Their pan style pizza crust was also delicious; ""burnt"" and crispy, which is just my style. So happy I finally got to experience this Chicago classic! :)",12,5,positive
96,"I'm not quite sure I understand the hype of this place... everyone seems to rave and I didn't think it was that good. On a Monday evening 3 of us snagged a seat at the bar with no wait. For a table it would have been 30-45 min.We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. They told us it would come out in about 45 min so we decided to get some apps in the meantime.We got the app sampler. It was standard fried food fare. Nothing special about any of the items.We also got an order of wings. Let me tell you, I am a tough critic on wings. These were really high up there for me! They were fantastic and a redeeming quality for this place. They were not breaded (a must) had been fried until crispy, were not soggy and were still super saucy. The sauce was thick and coated the wings well. My only negative I can say is we only got one drumstick. I guess some other order must have had a ton!The pepperoni pizza didn't actually take 45 min to come out. While the dough was thick and I liked the crispy edges, I think the general crust was too dry. Almost like I was eating focaccia bread instead of a pizza.  Regarding the rest of the flavors, nothing to write home about. Just pepperoni, which could have been a bit crispier in my opinion, standard sauce that I didn't even notice, and some cheese. Overall given all the hype, the pizza was nothing special. I would likely not come back here, but at least I can say I tried it once!",8,6,negative
97,"Pequod's!!! WTF have I been doing as a Chicagoan that it took me this long to try you?! I'm not going to lie, I've always been a Lou's loyalist when it comes to Chi Pizza - but y'all are giving them a serious run for their money. First things first, I get this isn't deep dish in our traditional sense, but it dang sure ain't thin crust. It is its own style 'Pan Pizza' as they call it, with a lot of crust and less cheese to it.I think I always overlooked Pequod's since it's a bit more humble in it's building (a two story spot in Lincoln Park with another location in Morton Grove) and also not having a million locations like some of the other pizza chains. Let me advise everyone else, don't follow in my footsteps! Do ~not~ sleep on Pequod's!I tried the Sausage Pizza last night and as mentioned, it has a crispy crust thicker than you're used to while still a bit airy, less cheese, less sauce and a decent amount of sausage on top. It was everything I dreamed it could be - tasty from the first bite to the last. I am a weak sauce and could only shovel one piece down the hatch (and I even struggled with the one piece) but others in my group had 2, even 3 pieces so YMMV. If you go to their actual location, you'll get the pie piping hot & fresh from the oven! But don't front, you may just want to take it to go to eat in shame alone while Netflixing and there's nothing wrong with that. Just be sure to dig in as soon as you can to get all the warm goodness you deserve.I saw online they do a 'Chicago Lunch Special' - $4.95 for a 7"" pan cheese pizza with a drink, Monday-Friday 11am-3pm for dine in orders. Yep, I'll be back for that.",8,5,positive
98,"Best Chicago deep dish pizza I've had, I think I see where some of the criticisms come into play, particularly involving the sauce/dough ratio, but there's something just good about having that doughyness.

Overall loved my experience there",4,3,positive
99,"Came here at 4pm on a Sunday and was seated right away. By the time we left around 5:30 however the place was slammed with people waiting outside. We ordered our pizza right as we sat down because we knew it would take a while. The 40min wait time for the pizza to cook was fairly accurate. We ordered the Pequod's salad and that came out right away. Nothing special but enough to split between 2-3 people. Of course we ordered the pan pizza as that's what they're know for! We got sausage, Canadian bacon and peppers on top (pictured). While we enjoyed our pizza I definitely think it's a bit overhyped. I personally prefer Gino's pizza/crust over Pequods. And a side note while the place is divey (I didn't mind) the bathrooms were pretty dirty and that's never cool.",11,2,negative
100,"The best deep dish in Chicago, and I've had them all. As a stuck up former New Yorker, I take my pizza seriously. Pequod's delivers with that unique carmelized crust, and a lightness to their pies that others lack. Cool vibe, but be prepared to wait.",1,1,positive

But by the time we were done with our meal, we saw people waiting outside the door. We ordered small (10 in) size pan pizza, which is their deep dish. There were many topping options- we went with pepperoni, fresh basil, and garlic. It took about 20 mins to get the pizza. I think it was not bad, but it had too much bread (and the bread was too dry for me). The cheese on the outside was definitely unique thing that Giordano's or Lou's don't do- so I thought that was a plus. Overall, I think it is worth trying it once if you haven't, but I honestly don't see myself coming back for deep dish. Maybe I will give it a try for thin pizza next time if I'm around the neighborhood.",3,1,negative
103,Pequods pizza does deep dish well. They have this 4.95 deal on the weekdays for the regular cheese pizza. You can add toppings at the price of 80cents each. Totally worth it to try it on the weekdays. I heard that on the weekend the wait can go over 3 hrs. So be prepared to wait. We got seated right away during lunch and pizza takes around 40 minutes to make. So do get some appetizers and their CHILI. Omg so gooooood. Deep dish pizza is doughy... and I can't really finish it but I can say I tried it! From LA to Chicago.,3,0,positive
104,"I've lived in Chicago (suburbs) most of my life, and prior to this I lived in Connecticut... I know the pizza game. First and foremost you HAVE to understand deep dish and ny-style are fundamentally different foods. Think of it like comparing vodka to beer... Sure they're both alcohol but everybody has a PREFERENCE.That said, wherever you sit on the Lou's/Gio's debate, I feel comfortable and confident saying this place is the best in all of Chicago. The carmelized crust brings this pizza to the next level. If you're from out of town and want to do things ""the Chicago way"" I reccomend getting your pizza with green peppers, mushrooms and sausage. In terms of portion sizes, normal eaters can usually eat 1-1.5 slices of the 12"", and big eaters maybe 2-3, absolutely no more.The place is pretty big (upstairs / downstairs) but I'd reccomend budgeting about 2.5 hours all said-and-done if you come on a Friday night or Saturday night. Wait times can  exceed an hour, then it takes about 45-60 minutes to get your pizza after getting seated. I went once on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated right away. I believe you can also phone in advance to get ""priority seating"" (not a reservation) which is probably worthwhile if you're going at a peak time.I reccomend ordering as soon as you sit down. While you wait, you can order drinks (they're pretty inexpensive) or apps. The apps are very average- avoid the bread but the mozz sticks were solid. The service definitely isn't stellar here, but the pizza MORE than makes up for it, as do the very low prices, realative to the big dd chains. You could easily come out with a tab under $50 for 4 people.This is unequivocally the best dd spot in all of Chicago and I always have (and will continue) to bring all of my nyc / west coast friends here when they visit.",15,0,positive
105,"My first time here: 2 large pizzas was just perfect for 8 of us (I was a bit stuffed though). We were lucky to be able to grab a reservation since there was a large group of us. Pizza was good, they didn't skimp on toppings at all. Service was good as well. Ended up being $16pp which is very reasonable since everyone had a drink. Only complaint is that it's pretty crampy (one could say cozy) and loud, and I wasn't a fan of the restrooms.",8,1,positive
106,"I've had pizza all over the country and have really honed in on Chicago since I live here. I must say that deep dish tends to be hit or miss and very subjective. I have tried both deep dish and ""thin"" crust from Pequods. Nothing great, nothing terrible. They overload the pepperoni as a topping. Very saucy pizza. Expect to wait an hour plus for the pizza (which is pretty standard.) If you are not from the area, be prepared to wait a while for a table. Not much room to wait inside. You'll frequently see tons of people waiting outside the front.",2,1,negative

I didn't taste much garlic and overall there was nothing special about it in flavor or texture. I could've bought a frozen garlic bread and made it better. JALAPENO POPPERSThe poppers were very disappointing because there was no spice or heat to them at all. They were cheesy, but bland. I definitely will not be eating these again.PAN PIZZA- sausage, spinach, green pepper, tomato, fresh garlic, bacon, fresh basil, and italian beefFor a pan pizza, the pizza was thick and not even crispy. It was pretty soggy and soft. It would've been forgivable if the flavors were there, but sadly, not even. I did like the flavors of the meat and veggie ingredients, but the texture and flavor of the pizza itself just killed the whole meal. The pizza here definitely is not on par as the one in new york nor the ones I've tried in other cities. I won't be getting pizza here or anything else.",8,6,negative
110,"Pequod's is one of my husband's favorite places for pizza. Unfortunately, its a little further away from our house so its a special trip every time we go here. The pizza is no doubt really good whether it'd be deep dish or pan pizza. I am not personally a fan of their pasta but I do like their pan pizza. We've been here for dinner with our friends and on birthdays and certainly turned out to be great. I would recommend this place to anyone whether a visitor (we've done this plenty of times) or chicagoan (if they haven't already been here).",5,1,positive

112,"First visit on a Friday night and this place is packed!  A friend arrived around 6:30 to put our names in, we were seated an hour later, with pizza(s)* arriving a bit less than an hour after that.  Issue with a super burnt crust first pizza (which I'm told is rare as others in my group have been multiple times attest), but service was quick and accommodating for our surprise +2 guests and high chair, and discounted our total bill for the problem.*Second pizza was delayed as they messed up the order, so was brought out later.  We crunched through the first burnt pizza (we think they left it on too long to wait for the second originally and that caused the burntness).And of course - the main thing to review: the pizza is amazing and totally worth the raves. The second was done to perfection, and even the first burnt one was delicious when creating the top off the crust bottom.  My friends were disappointed, but I don't care much for the bread anyways ao or was not a big deal to me. In any case, the way Pequad's does toppings is excellent. Overall:  Service 5Atmosphere 4.5Food 4.5Highly recommend ordering carry out, since the wait takes a while (2 hours before food, unless you order appetizer) and the place can be a bit claustrophobic for some with the crowds.",8,2,positive
113,"In any other city, Pequod's would likely be standout 'pan' (i.e. deep dish) pizza.. But in Chicago, it unfortunately falls to the middle of the pack:1) Lou Malnati's 2) Pizzeria Uno 3) PEQUOD's4) Gino's East5) Giordano'sThe toppings were plentiful and the sauce was well balanced - nothing ruins a good slice of deep dish like drowning it in tomato sauce. The caramelized crust is an especially nice touch.The one major downfall of Pequod's is their crust-to-cheese ratio.. Although the crust is light and airy - and significantly better tasting than most crust-heavy options - each slice is mostly dough with a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Double the cheese, half the crust.. & you have a winning combination.Pequod's is worth the visit, but be prepared to wait.. Getting a table at peak times can take an hour or more, and ordering a pan will set you back another 45 min. Get there early.. Take your time. Enjoy a slice.. Or simply order ahead for instant gratification.",11,5,positive
114,I have spent a lot A LOT of time in Chicago. I took a recommendation from people who live locally and Pequod's is BY FAR the best Chicago deep dish. Anyone who tells you different hasn't branched our or they are a tourist. The pizza came out at a great pace and we started off with beers and some side salads. The service was prompt and attentive. Love it. I'll keep coming here for sure and I highly recommend you check it out. The pizza is very filling. The picture is of a small. For two people we had half left and were very full. Pro tip: coming in during off hours so you don't have to wait. The wait can be incredibly long during dinner hours!,7,0,positive
115,"Pequod's is my hand's down choice for best pizza in Chicago. I have nothing new to say that 2000 other reviewers haven't. This is the type of place that causes traffic jams from all the people trying to dine in and take-out and blocking the lane next to the traffic light. Pequods is deceptively large, with two expansive floors and hundreds of tables, yet the wait is never less than 30 minutes. It's that good.Anyone who tells you they didn't love Pequods, ask them if they had it at the restaurant or as take out. The take out is good, but this pizza was MEANT to be eaten fresh out of the oven and it is world's better when eaten as dine-in. The crunchy chewy bite of the burnt cheese crust adds such a depth of flavor to each slice. Save Lou Malnattis, Gino's, Giordannos for the tourists, eat like a local and get Pequods.Pro-tip: Grab a beer at their sister bar next door while you wait, and check out the fried zucchini flowers appetizer.",7,2,positive
116,"Still the reigning champ. Came back here and got a small, half cheese / half pepperoni, which was perfect for two people. (Two slices each, which left me full, but not disgusting.)Absolutely the best deep dish I've ever had, and a staple of my Chicago trips.",3,1,positive
117,"I had the thin crust cheese with green peppers and mushrooms. The sauce was good and toppings  were tasty. The crust wasn't bad either it had a foldable texture but wasn't to soft . Overall good pizza just nothing that stood out. I don't eat pork and I feel that a lot of pizza joints in Chicago shine with there tasty sausage. So I am getting a more bland pizza than sausage eaters. All in all good pizza. The place is dim and a has chill environment. The staff was nice and helpful. I would try the deep dish next time , I haven't tried theirs yet.",7,4,negative

119,"Pequod's isn't exactly the deep dish one would expect, but it definitely has a following that's greater than any traditional deep-dish spot. A deep doughy pizza with baked cheese on the outside, making the crust look burnt. However, the crunch really sets it apart from many competitors. Pure Perfection!",0,0,positive
120,"Pequod's is a small pizzeria and has 2 floors. Be ready to order once you're seated since the pizzas are all made to order. With that said, be prepared to wait, the pizzas will take about 45-50 minutes to be made once your order is placed. The staff will tell you this but it's good to know beforehand as well. The pizza itself is worth the wait!Zucchini SlicesOne of the stars of our meal. The Zucchini was well breaded, very crispy on the outside. Molten veggie on the inside. Delicious. Can pair with ranch but great on its own.Cheesy Garlic BreadNot very tasty. Didn't seem like it was cooked correctly and the flavors were off. Most likely will never get again.PizzaGot a Medium thin crust pizza for 4 ppl. Well sized and we ended taking 1/3 of it to-go. The pepperoni used were super cute small slices but so high quality delicious. Get extra toppings of this if you can! The crust was a fantastic balance of crisp crust and fluffy bread insides.My experience was.... lacking. We came on a hot summer day, mistake numero uno. The AC was on but not effective at all, so the atmosphere was incredibly humid. Iced waters all around were more than necessary. Drinks took a minute to come due to the busy nature of the establishment. I felt bad, bc it was the old structural integrity of the building that mostly ruined the experience. However, staff themselves were helpful. If anything, would probably order out from here, instead of dining-in.",17,3,negative
121,"Ok I'm sorry, im probably going to get murdered for saying this but....it just isn't that good. I'm a big fan of chewy doughy pizza and this just isn't it. I don't know if that's how deep dish is supposed to be, but I was expecting something entirely different than what I experienced here. The pizza is just very ""bread-y,"" as if someone just put some cheese and tomato sauce on top of bread. The bottom of the pizza is hard like biscuit hard, and the crust wasn't too flavorful either. I was very hyped about this place after hearing so many good reviews but for some reason it just really disappointed me",4,4,negative

But my experience at Pequod's makes me now think that I'm just not a fan of Giordano's and Malnati's, not Chicago pizza as a whole, because Pequod's was and is THE PIZZA OF MY LIFE. It's also a huge plus they're open late!",0,0,positive
123,"After hearing a lot of great reviews and recommendations from friends, me and one other person decided that we'd look forward to having some traditional deep dish pizza from Pequods as the pinnacle of our trip to Chicago.Unfortunately, by the time Saturday rolled around, we both were ill and didn't want to risk leaving the hotel. Instead, we ordered a deep dish pizza for delivery. The Pequod's hostess gave us an estimated time of 2-hours for delivery after taking our order and jotting down our phone number. We expected the wait to be that long so we ordered the pizza at 5pm and just had a small snack until it arrived.At about 7:45, we were concerned that something may have happened and called Pequod's back. After listening in on some back-and-forth arguing in the background, they had informed us that they made the delivery and called us to come down to get the pizza. We had never received a call so we asked what number was used to call us. The number they read back to me was off by 1 digit. A simple mistake but handled very poorly.After telling them that they used the wrong number, they tried to tell me that I told them the wrong number. I think I know my own phone number. The more likely scenario would be that the hostess punched the number in wrong and it was a simple typo ( they had a 9 instead of an 8 ).I said, okay fine, so how long will it take to redeliver it? They said ANOTHER HOUR. Pequods is 15min a way from downtown. We begrudgingly inform them that instead of waiting another hour, we'll drive the 30min round trip to pick it up. So we began the journey, sick and hardly able to move, to Pequods on a Friday night, downtown at 8pm. The drive took longer than expected. Because there is no parking, I get dropped off at the front and immediately go to the pick up area inside. Upon receiving the pizza, I was told that it was ""taken care of"". At the time I wasn't sure if they were trying to apologize and pay for the pizza or if they just used my card that I had put down when I ordered it for delivery hours before. We certainly didn't get an apology.We get back to the hotel around 8:45. By this time, it had almost been 4 hours since we ordered the pizza and it had certainly been sitting out for about 3 hours.Needless to say, it was cold, hard and not enjoyable. The amount of effort that Pequods made to ensure satisfaction was dismal at best. If they would've apologized, remade the pizza, and would've been more clear on ""it's already taken care"", I think I would happily give this place another shot when I come back. Due to the poor handling, I gave this 1 star only because I later found out through my bank statement that they did, indeed, charge me for the pizza.",8,9,negative
124,"I love my trips to Chicago mostly for the pizza.  A colleague insisted we go to Pequod's as it was supposed to be better than Lou's.  Perhaps ""better"" is dependent on individual taste.    I ordered a caesar with anchovies and was not disappointment except for the small portion of dressing.    We split a small pizza with sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms.   The crust, cheese and sauce were as good as advertised but the sausage and bell peppers were overpowering and left me slightly disappointed.   I enjoyed the sausage by itself, as most of it falls off anyway.  And maybe I'm just not a fresh bell pepper lover.  If you go to Chicago, it is worth a stop but you might start with something like just cheese and pepperoni.",9,4,positive
125,"This off the beaten path deep dish pizza place came highly recommended. I was told to stay away from the chain deep dish and try this one. It is a little place near Lincoln Park. It is known for long waits and great pizza. We arrived early At about 4:30 PM expecting a long wait and we were seated immediately. We got their house special salad and put in our order for a large deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and onion. The salad was very good and when the pizza came I was amazed. It was not too greasy but it did have a lot of sauce. I thought it was some of the best deep dish I had ever tried and was very glad I did not go to one of the chains. The place does not have a lot of personality but it is all business when it comes to their pizza.  Service was good and prices were very reasonable it was 1875 for large pie and three dollars for each additional item.",8,1,positive
126,"This review could be a little biased since I haven't had Chicago pizza up until this point. I moved from Cleveland this week and picked the place with the highest number of reviews above 3 1/2 stars. Let me tell you, this pizza is a different experience. Sorry in advance for this next comment Chicago, but this is my outside view of what I thought your pizza would be like.... I thought Chicago pizza would be a giant bread bowl with tomato soup. Haha  It's DEFINITELY not! This was a first time pizza experience and it was unlike anything I've had before. The crust is what makes it so good. It looks burnt, but it's not it's caramelized stick to your ribs crust. If you're looking for the ultimate comfort food look no further.",3,1,positive
127,Honestly this is a place you either love or think is ok... and because its pizza there is no bad.  Ordered for delivery based on the hype and left much to be desired.  Too doughy for our tastes on the deepdish.  But give it a shot you may love it,2,2,negative
128,"Horrible service!!! Crawling slow... Come here only if you have hours to burn or nothing better to do than watch paint dry... As per website instructions I called and order my dine in order (at 12:13) which means ""we will put your pizza in 15 mins before your arrival""When I came in the hostess was confused when I informed her my order was ""dine-in"" like she never seen their website before. Thankfully, a server stepped in, helped her and confirmed my order was received and said she got the kitchen to put it in and that it will take 25mins from when we were seated. We were seated (1:04pm). When we were seated I told our server about our dine-in order he said he saw it and the order was in (I literally saw it on his tablet!!!)One eternity later... At 2:08pm the manager came to inform us that the kitchen has some how ""threw"" away our order and forgot it?!? Our server came to tell us that he ""did everything right"" and it was the kitchen's fault. Way to go for team work! The least you can do is accept responsibility for it instead of blaming your team mates. You could have followed up with them anytime at the 25, 35, 45, 55 min mark when you noticed we did not have any pizza on our tables but you didn't!!! You chose to check in with the kitchen after 1h and 4 mins later? And had the cheeks to say ""you did everything right"".I too accept responsibility for trusting that you know how to do your job like an adult and not following up with you sooner.",8,4,negative

And I don't know what it is, but I'm not head over heels about this place like some people are.Don't get me wrong, I've got a lot of respect for the caramelized crust, which is a nice little take on deep dish (which, to be honest, can only be modified so much). But I still like Lou Malnati's crust more.Obviously this place has a better, divey vibe, which I like.",7,1,positive
130,"I love stopping here whenever I'm in Chicago. My first visit was sometime at the end of May in 2017, and I loved it. I don't travel that often, and I thought I would never get to eat here again. But then I found myself in Chicago on September 2, and made a point to stop here.When I arrived, there were people waiting outside for tables. I realized that things were probably not going to work out for me with regard to getting a table. When I stepped inside there was barely any room to move, because so many people were waiting either to get to the host stand, or to order food to go or to pick up their to go orders.I got to the host stand and I was told that there was an hour and a half wait. I asked if I could place an order to go, and the host indicated that I could but that was a separate line. I got in that line and when I got to the front the woman with whom I was speaking indicated that there was a place at the bar and that I could sit there if I would like. So I did.When I sat at the bar, the bartender/waitress indicated that there was an hour and a half wait. I've already been told this by the host I had already accepted it. I placed my order and then sat and waited. About an hour and 15 minutes later my food came to me. It was hot and delicious. Deep dish pizza with pepperoni, green olives, and pineapple. Suck it if you don't like it. I love pineapple on pizza.When I was about finished eating, a woman who had come in about 30 minutes after I did, and who was also sitting at the bar, said to the bartender ""I'm a food blogger, and I was hoping to give you a good rating but having to wait an hour and 15 minutes for a personal size pizza is bullsh*t."" The bartender apologized. And then a few minutes later gave the woman an update and told her that her food was coming out soon. As I was already in the process of paying, I wrote on the back of my receipt ""I am NOT a food blogger, and I'm sorry that you have to put up with that. So I am giving you a larger tip than I normally would have because of that woman."" So I tipped her $9 on a $25 ticket. I showed her my note, and she got a good laugh. She packaged up the rest of my food to go, and I left. The end.",11,1,positive

I didn't really like the burnt crust gimmick they have but the cheese and ingredients were quality and overall it definitely filled my expectations for a Chicago style pizza I had to try as a tourist. Definitely better than Giordano's, but maybe I gotta try Lou Malnati's or whatever it's called and compare it to that.My bartender Jennifer was pretty attentive and kept the refills coming.",5,1,positive
132,My friend and I came at a really great time. A little bit after they opened when the crowd isn't there yet. We ordered their famous deep dish pizza. You get to choose the toppings. Each topping is $1.85 so don't go too crazy because that is how you get an expensive pizza.They have a sign for you telling you that it will take about 40 minutes for your pizza to be ready if you order it. My friend and I have small stomachs so after a slice we were pretty full.,4,2,positive
133,Chicago pizza... the real deal! This place is zero frills but some of the best damn pizza I have ever had!

The $5 personal pizza lunch special seemed too good to be true... but it wasn't!,4,1,positive
134,"Sweetened semi-solid tomato sauce charred in a pan that they call pizza.  YOU can dupe this @Home.  Peel off cheese in a tasteless and useless deep dish dough is the only FUN thing you will experience. It's a good thing I know the ingredients of a HAWAIIAN PIZZA as the female server didn't.  ""The personal pan is add your own ingredients.""  Lame deflection.  Then, she disappeared.GOUGING... the PREMIUM TOPPING of Italian Beef on a personal pan pizza is one layer, 2-slices of Italian Beef.  You just paid extra for tomato sauce and useless dough!  80% of this order went to trash.Decent crunchy ITALIAN BEEF.  My first grilled sweet pepper, then sliced.  Less beef than Others.Ask your own SERVICE is an embarrassment to Chicago dining.  ASK for water.  ASK for a table, host gives you a bar.  You ASK for a table again as it's empty, I still got a bar.  However, a Dude entered and got a table for 1.NO outlets near tables.  NO Wi-Fi either?  Don't forget it's a dive pretending to be IT.",2,4,negative
135,"Pequod's is a divisive food. I'm from New York and grew up with a pizzaiolo grandfather with Calabrian roots. This pizza would make him spin in his grave.I work near Pequod's and have eaten it a half dozen times or so, a few times in person, a few times delivered. We order it at work pretty often, because a bunch of people in my office love it. I'm not one of them. Do I really have to acknowledge that this place is popular? It's very popular, and my opinion is the minority opinion. It's not like I don't know this.One time after moving from Brooklyn to Chicago, I went with my wife to Pequod's and ate in person. We ordered a medium mushroom pizza. I strongly suspect the mushrooms came from a can. I could only describe the mushrooms as having the texture of snot and the taste of dirt. I have never in my life been made to feel so crestfallen by my food.Look. This is not pizza. This is focaccia. Unfortunately, this isn't even good focaccia: it's mediocre focaccia masquerading as pizza. This is food that lies to your face. It's almost entirely bread, with a rumor of sauce and a whisper of cheese, and everything is mysteriously sweet. Are they actually adding sugar to the sauce? What is even happening here? To continue to insist that this is pizza when it so clearly is not pizza is a form of gaslighting.And the ""caramelized crust""? Please. That's not culinary ingenuity, it's a parlor trick. It's just burnt cheese. Big whoop.",11,5,negative
136,"The pizza here is amazing!! The dough is thick, and nice and crusty on the bottom. The edges are just covered in baked cheese, so every bite has great flavor. The toppings are a bit pricey, $3 each, but they PILE them on, so I would recommend just choosing a few. The pizza takes a while to cook, which they tell you up front, so just get an appetizer to munch on and relax. Or, come outside of peak lunch/dinner hours. The appetizers are pretty standard fried fare, don't expect much. The pizza slices are very filling, so a large pizza stuffed four hungry people. Definitely recommend visiting!",6,1,positive
137,"Fantastic deep dish pizza.  Far superior to Giordanos and the other tourist places, this comes from a guy who was born in Chicago.  Only downside to the place is the long wait and parking can be tough in the area.  That being said it is definately worth the visit.",3,1,positive
138,"Pequods is probably my least favorite deep dish in all of Chicago and I was raised eating deep dish pizza.I live out of state now, so every time I visit, I need to satisfy my deep dish craving. Gino's East is usually my go-to, but I wanted to try something new. Pequods was rated so highly on yelp, I figured I had to go.We came in at just the right time and only had a ten minute wait for a table. Notice the sign upon entering that says the current wait time for pizza. Ours was 45 minutes.The lunch special seemed like a great deal for a personal pan pizza and soda for $4.95. I added spinach to mine and my boyfriend added spinach and meatball. My dad chose plain cheese.While we waited, we each ate a side salad. The house made Italian dressing was very oily and lacked seasoning.The pizzas arrived around the 45 minute mark, so keep that in mind if you're starving.None of our pizzas were hot and seemed to be sitting out for awhile before they were brought to us. The waitress said the kitchen was probably backed up. Humph. The sauce was unimpressive and I had to add oregano, parmesan, and red pepper flakes to make it more enjoyable. Then there was the cheese, or lacktherof. It was a very thin layer. Excuse me, I like my deep dish to be heavy on the cheese and sauce with crispy, thick crust. Pequods pizza tasted more like a lot of fluffy white bread with a small layer of cheese and sauce. My boyfriend agreed and was disappointed with his ""premium"" meatball topping. When we were leaving the restaurant, there were at least 20 people waiting for a table. Maybe we all just had a bad batch, because I can't figure out why this place is so popular. In the end, $4.95 for a personal pizza and soda is a great value, but don't expect flavor to be included.",11,2,negative
139,"Everyone and their mother has told me to check out Pequod's, and it really is the epitome of deep dish. I've tried many other deep dish places but this one definitely stands out in the ratio of crust to cheese to toppings.Eating in the actually restaurant, my cousins called for preferred seating which is not a reservation but to be able to be seated quicker. They told us the wait for them to make pizzas is about 40 minutes, but we didn't mind with our large group while we drank. The second pizza we ordered came with the wrong toppings and they were kind enough to make a new one and give us a discount for the wait.",2,1,positive

And as the pizza lover that I am, trying Deep Dish or Pan Pizza in Chicago (whatever you'd love to call it), has been on my bucket list my entire life and these guys did not disappoint. Started off with Mozzarella Sticks to hold off the long wait, and it was one of the best I've had. Not even going to lie. Super crispy, full of cheese, good for a beautiful cheese pull. And then came the pizza. And my goodness was it tasty. We got extra sauce, pepperoni, half pineapple (for my lady) and half sausage (for my half). Every single bite had a tremendous flavor, not excessive in dough and the iconic crispy/burnt crust was soooo good. Its one of the things they are known for! So happy we chose Pequod's! Our waiter was super attentive and checked in throughout. Can't wait to return when we are back in town! Thank you!",11,3,positive
141,"Everything was just... okay here. I had definitely done my homework about the wait times at Pequod's and filled out their priority seating form online. I'm not sure that this actually did much. They say that this is not a reservation, but you should get seated in about half the time if you were just to walk in. When we arrived, we were told that we would be seated in about 15-20 min. We ended up waiting about 45 min (after having to go to the hostess time 2 times to check on where we were)One of my big issues with this place is the service. When our table was finally ready, the hostess pointed to a table in the corner and told us that that would be our table and that it just needed to be cleaned off. The entry way area is very tiny and cramped, so rather than crowd the hostess stand we just went and stood by the table that the hostess said was ours. Another waitress/hostess came over to clean the table off and asked if we were her 6-top. There were only four of us, but we replied that the hostess told us this would be our table. She was very rude and dismissive and said ""Well, there's been a change you need to go back to the hostess stand"" Keep in mind, we've already been waiting almost an hour and each time to get to the hostess there's a line. We finally get seated after another 5 min trying to get back up to the hostess and it takes almost 10 minutes for our waitress to even come over to our table. As other reviews have said, the pizza's take quite awhile to make. They are very up front with this fact so it was not a surprise. Previous reviews have said they were able to place an order while they were waiting or call in an order. We were not allowed to do that (I'm not sure if this was a recent change or what) If the pizza had knocked my socks off I could dismiss the service/time issues... but really it was just ok. I think it was an experience to do this as a tourist, but I would probably not come back.",2,3,negative
142,"ALL BREAD. ALL HYPE. Born and raised Chicagoan: Logan Square/Avondale. I enjoy pizza and I'm not the type to state that real chicagoans don't eat deep dishes; I love deepdish. contrary to what most people think, most born and raised chicagoans love deepdish too. It's not something you eat on a Tuesday. A quick slice, quick bite, deepdish is none of that. It's a meal. A good meal. It's a midwestern special occasion...Chicago has the best Best pizza in the country. I recall going to the famous Pequod's years back(2 years) and visiting a friends place down clybourn I figured we'd order from them.  I wonder why I haven't gone in awhile? Today's order reminded me why...2 hour wait to get Focaccia bread with thin layer of sauce and pepperoni  placed in the most messy fashion... do your self a favor, and I swear I'm not the only Chicagoan to agree, go to Lou Malnati's...

143,"Honestly the pizza for this place was amazing. Unfortunately I'm giving it 2 stars because of the service we received. It says it's open until 2 am and we walked in around 130. They sat us down and told us that the pizza would be at least a 45 minute wait. Not that big of a deal, we all had a few drinks and were just ready to eat. We also ordered an appetizer that came out quickly. I personally ordered a slice of pizza and they said it would come out earlier than the full pizza my fiend ordered. This was not the case. We waited almost 60 minutes for the pizzas we ordered. We had to ask for it to go because my friend drank a little more than planned. They were rude and told us we had to get her out of the building. Even though we had paid 50 dollars for pizza, and still did not receive it. We asked for it to go and we finally go it. Unfortunately my slice did not come out at all. When we asked we were told another 5-10 minutes and our Uber was already there. The staff did not communicate properly, were rude to us and definitely served us later than they should have. My friends enjoyed the pizza they ordered the next morning but other than I would not recommend this place to dine in.",5,3,negative

145,"Yum, yum, yum. And I don't even like things like the ""burnt"" caramelized crust. But here, delish! Always hopping. Especially on a nice summer night. Lots of families even though it was later in the evening since the kids don't have school. I got lucky and snagged a bar seat to eat at right away so I didn't have to wait for a table. That's a nice thing they've got going on there. See a seat open at the bar and you can grab it and order your meal there. The bar tender was awesome. He made sure my Arnold Palmer was always filled before I hit bottom and did it perfectly. Super friendly and nice. Speaking of nice, the hostesses are always pleasant as you walk in. Let you know wait time, etc. The pie was nice and gooey. Eat your pizza there. It's repeatable but absolutely best eaten hot and fresh. I like to get the combo of pepperoni and sausage on this pie. Nice amount of sauce. These people appreciate your business and always treat their customers well. It's a fun, loud atmosphere with a unique take on deliciousChicago deep dish. I'd much rather come here than some other pizza joints that ignore you and are lackluster in both food and people. Can't wait for the next time I'm nearby and stop in.",21,2,positive
146,"After hearing about the long lines at Pequods, my husband and I decided to go at around 3:00 on a Wednesday. We were seated right away, but there weren't many open tables. The service was quick and friendly, and perfectly attentive. We ordered buffalo wings and a pizza 1/2 sausage and 1/2 meatball. The wings were really good. The pizza was delicious. The crust was crispy with cheese, the sausage, meatballs, and tomato sauce were super flavorful. We liked the sausage a bit more than the meatball. The downfalls: the meat was unevenly placed so there were many bites with just cheese. Also, by the time we got to the second piece, the bottom crust had gotten a bit soft. Regardless I would definitely go back and recommend it to others.",10,0,positive
147,"We waited over an hour in line. Then, we ordered a med pizza once sat. We watched everyone around us, who was sat after us, eat their pizza. So, we asked the waitress if there was a problem. She let her manager handle it so she could continue taking other orders. My date was upset. Manager tried to console us by offering a free pizza but my date wasn't having any of it. Now, Im back in Los Angeles and still bummed I traveled all the way to Chicago with no pizza to tell about. :( We were sat next to the waiter server station. A member of the wait staff passed us by at least 60 times. :( :( :(",1,1,negative
148,Thin crust pizza taste like the dough was frozen. The classic pizza was much better. But it has a lot of dough. Service was not that great. Had to ask for every thing and people were asking the bar for plates and other items.,4,1,negative
149,"We had heard that Pequod's had the best deep dish in Chicago so we were pumped to go especially since we really enjoyed giordano's and Lou malnati's. When we arrived, we were disappointed to see that the wait time for the pizza to come out was an hour. And that's on top of the 20 minute wait time to get in in the first place. But nevertheless we persisted and ordered mozzarella sticks, hot wings, and house salad to get started. The appetizers were very mediocre - I like frozen mozzarella sticks better and the hot wings were too tangy. We gave it a pass since pizza is the main attraction. We ordered two pizzas - one large with the toppings of the lou and one small with pepperoni, jalapeño, and garlic. The large pizza disappointed our entire party of 6.  The sauce needed more salt and seasoning, pizza seemed a little waterlogged, and didn't live up to the hype or wait time. The burnt cheese crust at the end was good though. The small pizza was a bit better because the pepperoni added the much needed salt but we left and went to Lou Malnati's after haha. Also there was this drunk weirdo hanging right outside our open window and we were concerned for our safety. We will pass on Pequod's in the future but are glad we got to try the different deep dish pizza places Chicago has to offer.",12,6,negative
150,"Best deep dish I've ever had! This spot came highly recommended, and I was not disappointed. We were expecting a small wait for lunch, but were quickly seated when the host realized he had a free high top near the bar. A personal big component in eating near a bar is the amount of distraction (hubbub, TV, etc), and it was perfect- plenty of sports options, but not so overwhelming that you couldn't focus on your conversation. We started with the garlic cheesy bread, which was sooooooo good! It came with a little cup of marinara, which could have been bigger (I mean come on, marinara), and was steaming and fresh. Totally worth burning my taste buds.And then the pizza. God, the pizza. I was interested in the caramelized crust when I saw it on the menu, and it was AMAZING. Normally I have to get really motivated to eat an entire pizza by myself, even a personal size, but this pizza was the motivation. I honestly questioned whether it's still really that unacceptable to lick a plate. Best place to start my time in the city, and I'm craving it now that I'm gone!",7,5,positive
151,"I live this place. Be prepared to wait unless you go at an off time. There are a few bars I'm nearby, so you can stop in for a drink waiting for your table. Nothing else to comment about besides the deep dish. All of the other food is average, exactly what you would expect, (salads, apps, etc). The pizza is off the charts, my favorite deep dish in the city. Carmel crust is the nail in the coffin. So delicious, I typically get the sausage since it's not your typical store bought Italian sausage. It's fresh crumbles that make for an unbelievable pizza. Go here if you want the best Chicago deep dish experience in the city",4,1,positive
152,"This is my experience after a few trips to Pequod's. There is always a wait...always. You just have to accept that fact and plan accordingly. Have been hear with small groups at 5 a d at 7, and no matter what, you'll have a 45-60 minute wait. However, the pizza is pretty darn good, the crust with caramelized cheese however, is AMAZING!! I legit could eat 5 lbs of the crust, I'd be sick, but happily so. The toppings are always plentiful and service doesn't take too long, about 40 minutes usually. Service is okay, considering how busy a d over worked the staff always seems. Prices are decent a d I have heard they have an amazing lunch special that is really a bargain. Personally, I think this is better than Lou's and the rest of the Chicago staples for pan/deep dish, and if you are patient, will be happy you waited every time.",11,1,positive
153,"I've never been a big fan of Chicago deep dish pizza, the first time I had it (at another restaurant) I wasn't impressed so I was hesitant to have it again.  I heard so much and read so much about this place that I decided to give Chicago pizza another try.  This is more unique than other places, they have the cheese on the side that burns, I love that!  The sauce really made the pizza really delicious.  I couldn't stop raving about the sauce!  All the ingredients are fresh and delicious.  Keep in mind, it takes about 40 minutes for the pizza.  The wait wasn't that bad, and the service was great.  I highly recommend if you're in the Chicago area!",7,4,positive
154,"I've been here several times and have been disappointed every time. Yesterday was the last time I'll get pizza from here. The pizza was so much bread--about an inch of bread--it was ridiculous. It was an over-cooked loaf of bread essentially, very disappointing pizza for the wait time. For the price of the pizza you're better off trying to make a pizza yourself.",1,3,negative
155,"Hands down amazing pizza and worth the wait! There are hour long waits for very good and delicious reasons! If you don't mind sitting at the bar as opposed to waiting 1+ hours for a table, then it's first come first serve!We were expecting to wait 1.5 hrs, but luckily bar space opened up so we snatched up those seats right away. Sitting at the bar also has its perks, because you can order and receive your drinks right away. We ordered the Fried Mushrooms, Half Order of French Fries, and the Small Pan Pizza with Mushrooms, Sausage, and Spinach!The Fried Mushrooms were perfectly Fried. The inside wasn't complete mush or still raw. The Half Order of Fries were also seasoned well and not overly salty. The given wait time for the pizzas are 1 hour, which makes sense since something this good takes time. The appetizers helped to satiate the hunger as we waited. The pizza was phenomenal! The crust was just so perfectly buttery and crispy at all the right places. The crust was not damp and soft from the cheese, sauce, or toppings like how some other deep dish places get. The toppings were very generous! The sausage piece were the size of meatballs!",17,0,positive

157,"We waited for 2+ hours to eat Chicago deep dish. TWO HOURS. Yet, we destroyed our half cheese, half mushroom-jalapeño pizza in about 10 minutes. We accomplished this fest not because we were ravenous, but because the pizza really was that great. Compared to the big deep dish names in the city, this local pizza joint boasts flavors that ensnare the senses. The tomato sauce is more than just sugar and tomatoes, but a blend of Italian herbs that flood the mouth with a full, umami experience. There is a healthy amount of fresh mozzarella cheese layered on the pizza, the kind that pulls away in long beautiful strands with each bite. I loved that each bite was a burst of cheese and sauce, with a fluffy bed of crust to cradle it all from beneath. There was no grease at all on the bottom of this crust, and the ends are definitely not going to be skipped: additional cheese is toasted to a crisp on the edges and is a special surprise at the end of each slice. Deep dish looks overwhelming and can certainly be excessive. However, this place managed to strike the perfect balance of flavors and breadth. We left stuffed and happy, not gross, and I couldn't have asked for a better first deep dish experience in this city.",10,3,positive
158,"We were told a 90 minute wait and we discussed and were happy to wait.  After 2 hrs and 15 min, we were treated poorly, ignored and we left. No pizza is worth that with two small children.

We left and had wonderful pizza with people not over promising and under delivering.  A huge amount of time we will never get back.  Angry and never going back.",5,0,negative
159,"It took me forever to believe my friend's assertion that Pequod's was really THAT DAMN GOOD...but now that I've been here, it really is THAT DAMN GOOD. There are so many things about Pequod's deep dish pizza that make it superior to any other pizza I've had in Chicago. Their trademark crust made of caramelized mozzarella cheese instead of extra dough. The sweet and tangy tomato sauce that balances out the crust. The fact that they use a ton of mozzarella cheese, but it never gets too stringy at any point. The plentiful amount of toppings they throw into their pizza unlike other places in Chicago (yeah, I'm looking at you Giordano's). The super high quality meat they use in their pizza. Bottom line, if there is such thing as deep dish pizza perfection, Pequod's has achieved it!If you're trying to wonder how much is the right amount, a large pizza is RIDICULOUSLY huge and should be more than enough for four people. And the wait for the pizza to cook is about 30-40 minutes, about what I expected.Service was pretty friendly, I have zero complaints on this end.Sometimes you gotta call it how you see it immedaitely, and I'm calling it right here: Pequod's has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago!",12,1,positive

We ordered the chicken fingers which was regular and came with bbq sauce in a to go container. The chicken fingers were crispy just the way I like it. I thought the deep dish was ok. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious but nothing spectacular. I felt like I had something similar. It had the right amount of meat vs cheese and dough, wasn't overwhelming! A small deep pan for 2 is more than enough for us. They had the lunch special, a personal cheese deep  pan and drink for $4.95 I believe, such a great deal if you don't mind just a cheese pizza.",8,1,positive
163,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE ""PIZZA""I am a native Chicagoan and was raised on extraordinarily great pizzas, and over the last three years, I have sadly watched all the best Chicago pizzas, except for one, slide down into the pizza abyss, where lousy pizza goes to die. Pequod's is not the lone survivor, that place starts with a ""G."" Pequod's is just another hack ""pizza."" I'll explain in greater detail for those of you wondering how this could be. Last Friday, late, my wife and I had a craving for pizza. Since our old favorites, which I won't indict here now, have become terrible, I decided to order my first Pequod's ""pizza."" I was so excited after all the buzz I had heard over the years. I even told the order taker how excited I was to order from them for the first time. Well, after the bready thing arrived, and we inspected it, I realized I had been taken for a ride. The ""pizza"" was not pizza at all, but rather three quarters of an inch of extremely sugary bread, topped with an imperceptibly thin film of cheese. The toppings we ordered, garlic and spinach, were nonexistent. I did spot what looked like a tiny spinach leaf, but I cannot be sure it was indeed spinach. Neither my wife nor I were able to taste any garlic, and we are both lovers of garlic. Atop the barely noticeable cheese and nonexistent toppings was a fine layer of what tasted like sugar-laden canned spaghetti sauce. I cannot believe anyone would eat this stuff, it's awful. I paid 20 bucks for a half a loaf of lousy bread and a slice of cheese with some smeared on spaghetti sauce. If this alleged ""pizza"" was good at one time, that's in the past, and I can assure you, it is not worth trying. We also ordered salads and soup, which was fair at best, and certainly the highlight of the order. I will never order from Pequod's again, once was more than enough. I wish I could give a negative rating, or a zero, because that would be an accurate score, so I will do it here: minus 3 rating for Pequod's. Absolutely terrible. Perhaps they will read my review and hastily make the appropriate upgrades to their bready thing that they mistakenly call a ""pizza.""",17,8,negative

Piquods is a weird little restaurant (maybe bar??) that we found out in Chicago. It's mainly famous for having a whale with panties on it's head or something like that...  while the inside joke of that or why it's a whale goes completeeeeely over my head, let me tell you, it's the best Chicago pizza I've had thus far! That crust is to LIVE for and it's sooooo thick. The cheese was just dripping off fresh out the oven and I enjoyed every last bite!If you're ever in Chicago, please check out this place because I know whenever I go back, I'm gonna get this again along with a few other spots I didn't get a chance to go to.

167,"This was a fantastic deep dish pizza. It's the best I've ever had. I don't think there's much that can be improved upon. Do not go anywhere else. Do not mess with your one chance at an excellent Chicago style deep dish. Come with an empty stomach, with your sleeves rolled up and you won't be disappointed. Definitely get the caramelized deep dish. There is no other way to go. A small feeds two people. Medium can work for two very hungry people. The pizzas are dense and they do not skimp out on the toppings. I don't think I have ever had better Italian sausage than what they serve. I won't even ding them for this but the pizza came out a bit luke warm. It wasn't pipping hot, burn your tongue and the roof of you mouth. So that's good. But then again the pizza cooled off rapidly. I am not really sure what I am getting at by saying bus because I both appreciate how it wasn't too hot but then again it became a bit unappealing when it cooled off. Maybe I'm hard to please. The service was great. Just attentive enough to not be annoying and get what we needed. The place is your standard brick walled pizza shop. Our wait on a Friday was about 30 min at peak dinner hours. Not bad! I highly recommend this place. This is just about as perfect as it gets.",16,8,positive

Everyone was raving about their ""caramelized"" aka burnt-looking but not really burnt crust.What I wasn't looking forward to was the hour plus long wait that everybody mentioned. Fortunately, it only took our pizzas about 30 minutes to come out. This was likely because we ordered personal-sized pizzas. The pizza was delicious as was the crust. The personal size ended up being more than enough. It looks deceptively small until you remember that it's deep dish, so I actually had some leftover. We got some apps beforehand because we expected the pizza to take longer to come out (cheesy garlic bread and fries), and I'd recommend the cheesy garlic bread.",3,4,positive

Super cold 2 degree afternoon, snagged a table by the door( that sucked) but the service and people were great. We immediately ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom deep dish and buffalo wings. The wings came out lightning quick and we devoured every last one. That sauce was amazing!As we waited 45 min, my impression of this place fell a bit. Since we were by the table by the door, the 5pm traffic flow came thru and people were crowding around us at all sides. My chair was getting smacked by people walking behind me, getting their coats snagged on my chair. By the time our food arrived people were hovering over our deep dish pan, faux fur from people's coat hoods literally above the pan. My boyfriend had his back to the main entrance(which was worse than my seat) and people were literally talking loudly in his ear and hovering over our table while we attempted to eat dinner. We asked to switch to a booth and the waitress was unable to make the switch happen.

175,"Came on a Sunday evening around 6:30PM and the restaurant was fully, completely packed with throngs of people waiting to get seated outside.  I overheard that the wait is at least 1.5 hours.  At this time the restaurant was in a state of controlled chaos as customers who are waiting, customers who are seated and staff members shuffle around the small space and yelling to be heard.  I had called ahead 1.5 hours to place a carry out order at 7PM and was surprised to find that I had to wait another 20 minutes before the pizza was ready.  Not sure if the pizza was already made and waiting for a staff to bring it out or they actually just started making the pizza when I arrived and paid.  Either way really defeats the purpose of calling ahead.While I liked the Italian sausage on the pizza.  I didn't like the dough, which was too soggy (I know should have had the pizza at the restaurant but can't afford the wait time).  And the dough was too thick, accounts for at least 75% of the thickness of the pizza.  I want a better dough to sauce/veggies/protein ratio.  Glad I tried it because the hype is high but I don't think Pequod's is worth the wait.",7,2,negative
176,"This review has been a long time comin! As a Chicagoan let me break down the significance of Pequod's to you. Gene and Jude's is to the native Chicago hot dog as Pequod's is to native Chicago pizza. Both of these places are highly over looked by tourists but deeply loved by us natives. If you're newly introduced to either, well, better late than never- just get wit da program! Until my most recent visit I strictly ordered the deep dish (i never say pan. sorry not sorry.) because that's what they're known for! This will probably be the crispiest deep dish crust you'll ever have and instead of a nice handled crust to hold onto it's sloppy & a little burnt. Perfectly imperfect achieving even more crunch when you've reached the top! Thin crust is equally good but that shouldn't surprise you because even the littlest mom & pop pizza place cranks out the best thin crust. Chicago pizza is unbeatable. Chicken tenders and no cheese garlic bread are a must for appetizers. Just don't forget to leave room for the pie. (Pizza pie, duh. not dessert. lol)Dinning during prime time weekends you're looking at an hour+ wait and impossible parking. Can vouch that this is a great place for large groups. They accommodated our group of 20 allowing us to make resos and place our order in advance. 7 Pizzas and 1 Italian Beef. Only one pizza order was incorrect and for the most part, service was good. They will not seat your party unless everyone is in attendance. Thankfully, that was no problem for this group of Elites! Special Shout Out: To our honorary guests-Yelp Team Leaders wishing them a farewell, to Christopher V for suggesting Pequods, to Ahmad A for all he did for us that night (We still owe you, Friend), to everyone who was in attendance & on time (blown away by your punctuality!!), & to Selena C + Liang H for planning!",12,8,positive

My friend and I came to the restaurant on a Sunday evening around 6pm and waited about 45 minutes for a table. While we waited, we headed a couple doors down to a bar also owned by Pizano's. When we finally got a table at Pizano's, we ordered wings and fries to munch on while our pizza baked. We ordered a small deep dish pizza with sausage. The crust is absolutely delicious with melty cheese baked in a cast iron skillet. Pizano's is also very generous with their toppings. Between the two of us, we finished the wings and fries, but we were only able to eat a slice of pizza each. I gladly asked for a box and enjoyed the leftover pizza as a midnight and breakfast the next morning. Only downside was that Pequod's a bit of a trek from our hotel.",6,2,positive

Throughout my meal I kept feeling sorry for ppl who came before us and were still waiting to be seated. They were bout to realize they wasted 3 hrs of their life waiting on unmemorable pizza. Burnt cheese is so over hyped and for most parts it's like you are eating a thick crust with some cheese and sauce with no flavorMaybe deep dish isn't for me but then I remember  Patxi in San Francisco and hope one day Chicago will live up to its name and surprise me with a great deep dish. Until then I say if you want deep dish go to Patxi!,5,3,negative

I felt that the cheese and sauce on the deep dish were lacking flavor - the only thing that impressed me was the flavor and consistency of the crust. We ordered a ""thin"" crust too, and it was super thick - and not that good. Service was great though and I liked the low key atmosphere. Overall I would give it another shot.

186,"Pequod's is a unique offering in a city of amazing pizza. Unfortunately, their product (while good) didn't quite match the hype.First off, this is objectively not ""Chicago Deep Dish"" pizza. It's pan pizza. I'm only pointing this out to tourists who might confuse the two.*Deep Dish: thin, crumbly crust with little to no rise and a side wall of crust (like a pie). Pizza usually served with cheese/toppings on the bottom and sauce on top.*Pan: thick, risen crust topped with sauce, cheese, toppings (in that order).Pequod's menu has two styles of pizza listed: 'thin' and 'pan.'Now that that confusion is out of the way, here's my review:Pequod's is a small pizzeria that is very popular and you should expect to wait at peak hours. The pizzas take about 45-50 minutes to bake once your order is placed, so be prepared to sit down for a while. What you are looking to get here is the pizza.Food*We started with a 1/2 cesar salad to pick at while we waited for our pizza. We ended up sending the salad back because most of the lettuce was turning brown around the edges. It may have been okay, but I'm surprised something so unappealing looking could make it out of the kitchen.*We ordered a small pepperoni pan pizza. Perfect for two light eaters who wanted no leftovers. The pizza was tasty. The toppings were all in good quantities and had great flavor and aesthetics. The crust was disappointing. Somehow, they have a pan crust (risen, airy) but the bottom is still sort of crumbly in texture (imagine crumbly fried biscuit on the bottom and airy pan crust in the middle). While the bottom and sides was nicely browned/charred, the middle tasted doughy/yeasty, like a dough that was cooked on the bottom but a little raw in the center.*The very best aspect of the pizza is the crispy edges formed by caramelized cheese welded to the crunchy exterior crust. I could eat this crust all. day. long.*It's sort of a weird pizza. I feel like you have to eat 75% of an okay pizza to get to the 25% of the best darn thing you'll put in your face all day.Service:*It's not great. Everyone was friendly and prompt when we first arrived, but then our server just sort of left us alone in a bad way. As I mentioned earlier, we had to send back our appetizer salad, but we sent it back with the cook that brought our pizza. The server never came back after our salad arrived to check on us. We never received an offer for refills on our waters. The place wasn't extremely busy, we just sort of felt ignored.Value:Our small pizza was $15 and I think that's fair if not a deal! Obviously, our salad was comped, but I really liked the fact that we ate our fill and were out for under $20. Of course if you get a lot more toppings on your pizza that can go up quickly, but I was highly satisfied with the value of our order.Overall:Pequod's was on my Chicago pizza bucket list, but it's far from my favorite in the city. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for something a bit off-beat and memorable. The outside edge of the pizza crust is so good, it's worth your attention and any pizza-lover should have it before they die.",23,8,negative
187,"Yumyumyumyum the crust and the dough are delicious. The service was attentive but be prepared to wait for your thick, luscious pizza to be cooked. I got cheese and tomatoes. My friend got pepperoni, green peppers. The medium was just right to stuff us with no other appetizer.",3,0,positive
188,The carmelized crust was delicious but there was a lot of bread compared to Giordano's. We ordered the Pequods salad and it was very impressive. I'm a huge Giordano's fan and was told by some locals this is better - but Giordano's it's still the winner for us.,4,0,negative
189,"This place is a bit of a jaunt to get to if you're using public transportation, but it's worth it. We were seated right away, upstairs. The temperature of the restaurant was a bit uncomfortable, too hot. The restaurant is a bit dingy, but hey, we're here for the food. We ordered a pan pizza with sausage. It was delicious! Really large, flavorful hunks of sausage. They caramelize the edges of the crust, so it ends up being a slightly burnt mix of cheese and crust. In comparison to other deep dish places, I'd say the crust here is thinner and there's less cheese. It's also quite a bit cheaper than other deep dish places.",6,1,positive
190,"Deep dish pizza is a Chicago thing and Pequod's sure executes it well enough! I've been to almost all the deep dish place you can name in Chicago but still like Pequod's better. And yes their pizza does have more bread and it's charred at the bottom (which is the best part). Other appetizers are not bad too for your regular bar food.Just be aware that this place is overcrowded over the weekend for peak dining time, and would be a long wait if come with a big group. To what level? Well, there was one time a group of my friends came here, put our name down, went across the street to watch a movie, and then came back to get our table. if you come a bit early or only a few people, the wait isn't too bad.",5,2,positive
191,"""Real Chicagoans don't eat deep dish!"" I'm a real Chicagoan, and I'm telling you, that statement is WRONG. Especially when it comes to Pequod's. Don't get me wrong, there is a time and place for deep dish, but if you're making that time and place for it, Pequod's can't be beat. The crust is absolute perfection. Great portions of both meat and veggies. And just has that ""pizza place feel"".There's not much else to say. Pequod's has the best deep dish in the city.",2,1,positive
192,"Looking for Chicago style pizza? Then you need to check out Pequod's!! It's usually very very busy, so try to make a reservation ahead of time. We came here as a group of six and ordered a few appetizers and two medium pizzas to share, which was more than enough! For apps, we got the cheesy garlic bread, bruschetta and breaded shrooms. I highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread, which comes with a marinara sauce on the side, as well as the breaded shrooms. I mean c'mon, fried mushrooms!! The bruschetta was underwhelmingly flavorless. For the pizzas, they weren't kidding about the caramelized crust! This is hands down the best part about the pizza. I'm typically more of a thin crust pizza kinda gal but Pequod's makes me wanna change my mind!",4,3,positive
193,"Went here on a Friday night with a reservation for four people. Had to wait about 15 Mins to get a table. Not bad at all. I'm a White Sox fan so all the Cubs stuff was great to see (haha).Restaurant has an upstairs that I didn't notice was so big. We requested the table right in front by the entrance but to no avail. Host did what she could (I think!?)I knew I wanted some of this caramelized crust I kept hearing about. Also knew the pizza would take 45 Mins so we ended up ordering two appetizer combos and some wings (wings suck). The fried platter was LIT. Zucchini and BOOMERS were en fuego. The table ordered some beers and a margarita.But let's get to the pizza...pepperoni and sausage pan. Both awesome. Crust was the boss. Better than Lou Malnatis and Due/Uno. I love places that have a large following and there aren't a ton of locations.Parking was easy to find too. Our server was good but VERY upset about a table next to us that told her they felt ""pressured"". As Kramer says, POISE COUNTS!If I want deep dish or pan pizza, I'd go back. If I want stuffed in the city I have to find my way to ART OF PIZZA!",6,4,positive
194,"Always have enjoyed deep dish pizza. Pequod cheese pan pizza small size and a personal of sausage, onion, and mushroom was ordered. The personal was a bit on the soggy end to my liking. I think partially due to the toppings. The cheese was perfect. Crunchy, a little doughy, but enough sauce and cheese for each bite. The burnt crust was also tasty and not overly charred. Overall had a good experience and with good company",6,0,positive
195,"I've tried Pequod's and Lou Malnati's, but I still think that New York has the best pizza. Guess I'm not a big fan of the deep dish. The flour/crust has the consistency similar to corn bread.Got the appetizer samplers which included mozzarella sticks, the jalapeño poppers, mushrooms and zucchinis. I thought the jalapeños were the best of the four. I also ordered two personal pizzas, and the half-spaghetti for the three of us. There was more than enough food. And I'd recommend sticking to their specialty, pizza.",4,0,negative
196,"During my first visit to Chicago, I tried deep dish pizza from Pizzeria Uno and Giordano's. True Chicagoans smiled politely when they heard about my Chicago style pizza experience, and told me I needed to try Lou's or Pequod's.Fast forward four years later, and my husband received multiple recommendations from his co-workers recommending Pequod's for the best pan pizza. My sister, her husband, my husband, and I ended up at Pequod's after spending the day at the Shedd Aquarium.It was packed. The entry space is small; there is no indoor waiting area, so people have to stand around. Standing combined with heavy winter gear and bags was no fun. However, I thought the host was quick and kind. He acknowledged everyone, and after waiting for about 25 minutes, we were ushered upstairs to our booth.We ordered the appetizer sampler and it was fair. The appetizer sampler and the garlic bread are nothing to get excited about--standard mozzarella sticks, mushrooms, fried zucchini, and jalapeno poppers.We ordered two small pan pizzas to split between the four of us. My sister and I had pepperoni and black olives on our choice, and my husband and brother-in-law added fresh garlic, pepperoni, sausage, and jalapeños to their choice. The wait was pretty standard, so be prepared to wait anywhere between 30-50 minutes for your pizza.When the pizzas arrived, I was most excited about the crust. However, I was pretty disappointed! The crust on the pizza my husband and brother-in-law ordered was soggy. The pepperonis weren't crispy like I liked them. The sausage on my husband's pizza was very chunky; I didn't like it. The jalapeños were tossed on like an afterthought, and they weren't even cooked--just warm, pickled jalapeños. The pizza my sister and I ordered was a little better, but not by much.Am I missing something??? Is Pequod's not supposed to be Chicago style and just a pan pizza? Is there a difference?! And if it is just a ""pan"" pizza, this can't be the best Chicago has to offer. I need answers. All in all, I wasn't excited about my pizza experience at Pequod's, and as of right now...omg. I can't type this. Should I type this? Okay. Okay. My favorite Chicago style pizza is at a place in California called Patxi's pizza. I like the cornmeal crust and the thinly sliced sausage. Patxi's has crisp pepperonis and to die for red sauce. Okay. I'll show myself out.",21,5,negative
197,"By Yelp's standards, 3 Stars = ""A-OK"" which is exactly what Pequod's is.I'm ready to get slammed in my comment section, but that's all I have to offer, nothing more, nothing less.The pizza was not-memorable, other than it was not better or worse than one of it's major competitors (to remain nameless)... literally, I could not tell the difference between the crust at Pequod's and that of it's major competitor who also offers a butter/caramelized crust. Pequod's is hyped as the best Deep Dish in the city, and I disagree. It was A-OK. The prices are very affordable. The sauce is very mild in flavor and could use some more seasonings to make it more robust. You'll wait about 45 minutes for a table for 2, then the same amount of time for the pizza. Service is nice enough and the menu does not expand much beyond basic italian fare.",7,2,negative
198,"I don't even know where to start...When we planned our trip to Chicago, we had made a list of restaurants to try based on recommendations from friends and colleagues. Pequod's never made the list. What a sad mistake it would have been to have missed this place. Fast forward, we are in Chicago, dining at one of our favorite restaurants in the country, when we strike up a conversation with our server. We give him the list, for his take, and he immediately questions why we have omitted Pequod's? We all look at each other and shrug; never heard of it... He went on to tell us that it's the best pizza in Chicago. Well then, on the list it goes. So, on our last day in town, before heading to the airport, we made it in. The hope was it would live up to the recommendation as this would be our last meal in town. And boy did it! The great experience started with the fist call. I asked if they could store our bags (party of four, each with a suitcase) and reply was ""we don't have a spot, but head on down, we'll figure it out"" - love that!We get there and the place is packed! That said, they found a spot for our bags and we were seated within ten minutes. The appetizers were great, especially the fried zucchini and fried mushrooms. The beer selection was great. And finally, the deep dish (extra cheese and mushrooms) was to die for. We hit Lou Malnoti's and Giordani's on the same trip, but Pequod's blew them out of the water. Do not leave Chicago without giving them a try!",8,7,positive
199,My boyfriend saw this place on Food Network. He couldn't wait to try. So we came right from airport. Got brought upstairs which caught us off guard. Old school dark brick vibe. A little too dark for me honestly. Our table smelled like a dirty wet rag when we sat down. That's very off putting. We each ordered personal pan pizzas with toppings. I'm Italian from New York and a pizza snob. So I'm a little bias. The sauce is tasty but more of a sweeter marinara than I like. This place is famous for the way the cheese bubbles and burns on the edge. People go crazy for that. I didn't like it. The dough is dry not moist. So I felt like I was hearing a hearty bread with sauce and cheese. I asked for fresh garlic and black olives as sides. ISmelled garlic lightly but did not see or taste any. The black olives were good. Not bad just not my cup of tea. The smelly table set the tone maybe.  If your coming to Chicago it's one of those places you should try.,8,10,negative
200,"I have been to Pequod's many times for a ""dining in"" experience and have always had a great pizza.This time I decided to get a pizza to carry out because the place was already very crowded.Unfortunately, it was only a ""meh"" pizza.The carmelized edge was a treat, but the crust and sauce were bland.  The sausage was very sparse.For a place of this caliber, the pizza was extremely disappointing.",1,2,negative
201,"We made a visit to Chicago for the marathon this weekend. My boyfriend, who is the runner, requested classic Chicago deep dish pizza for his post race meal. Our server another restaurant actually referred us to Pequod's. We took a short metro ride and a lovely walk through Depaul University to get to the restaurant. The wait was 1 to 2 hours but we were able to find a seat at the bar. The food was absolutely incredible and I am so glad that we were told about this spot. We ordered the bruschetta and a deep dish pizza with meatballs and canadian bacon. We weren't able to finish it all in one seating and happily took it home for a snack later.   When I make a return trip to Chicago I will definitely make this one of my meal stops.",5,0,positive
202,"Pizza- check, sauce- check, carmalized crust - check! This pizza and cornbread crust is to die for. Sometimes the crust can be a little too carmalized but sometimes you get that sweet perfect bite by the crust and its just heaven. One of my fav pizza joints in Chicago.",4,1,positive
203,"Had to give Pequods a second trial after so many people raved about them. Second time around, pequods stole our heart. We ordered sausage, pepperoni, and onions; it was delightful. The crust is so fulfilling (my favorite part is the burnt cheese). Definitely a must try. There is usually a long wait but the buzzers they give you as place holders connection reaches to the bar next to Pequod's- go get some dranks while you wait! P.s. fried mushrooms hit the spot as an appetizer",2,2,positive
204,"So by recommendation of a local Chicago resident, we decided to partake in Pequod's for a real legit Chicago Deep dish pizza.  This is a small joint with old school charm but for all the right reasons.  After a short wait, we got to sit upstairs which we didn't even know existed.  We started with the appetizer platter of fried cheese, zucchini, mushrooms and hot poppers.  I love fried cheese however the hot popper was the winner as it pleasantly had a cheddar cheese/pimento mix instead of what the normal cream cheese that I'm accustomed to and it was delicious.  But that's not where this journey ends, as recommended by the waitress we had the Supreme deep dish pizza.  The pizza takes 40 minutes to cook so I had time to have a house salad, which was good but I should have not wasted stomach room as the main event was coming!  The pizza arrived.  Giant cast iron pan filled with mushrooms, peppers, onions, and sausage - homemade sausage made in house.  I'm not usually a fan of sausage on pizza but this place is the  exception, soo good.  Sound good?  I haven't gotten to the best parts!  The crust was crunchy on the bottom but perfectly cooked  which made the best vessel for all of these toppings and then we get to the sauce!  Oh my!  I don't think I need a pizza to eat this sauce but it sure went well with it.  This is my first real Chicago deepDish pizza and was possibly the best pizza I've eaten thus far.  I truly want this pizza at home and it makes me mad knowing I cant( no offense to my pizza owner friends) but I have a totally new respect for deep dish and what we have is not deep dish, for true!",19,3,positive

207,"Pequod's serves pan-style deep dish, with sauce underneath the toppings.

If I had to pick one pizza place in Chicago to send my friends when they come to town, this would be it.",2,0,positive
208,"My biggest problem with the pizza is that it is too doughy. But I come to realize this issue varies day to day. It is less likely to occur with smaller pizzas. With bigger pizzas, I add extra tomato sauce (not an ideal solution).Overall, pequod's is a good pan pizza. It's caramelized cheese crust is to die for which is properly a very accurate term because there is no way burnt cheese is good for you. However, the pizza does lack some texture balance with the dough. And, unfortunately I do find this distracting to my eating experience. Don't get me wrong! You should still go out of your way to have this pizza if you haven't had it. It's unique. Just don't expect it to be the best unless all you care about is the caramelized crust.",6,4,positive
209,"I'm disappointed because of all the build up. My kids gave them one, two, and three stars--so the average is two. The deep dish crust was a bit dry, didn't have enough cheese, and edges were burnt. The thin crust pizza was okay. The zucchini was inedible. The onion rings were okay. I really don't understand why they got all these awards. The pizzas didn't have a lot of flavor.  Neither did the garlic bread. I just expected more from a place that was highly acclaimed. Too bad.",3,2,negative
210,"Dining there yesterday was just so uncomfortable. We got seated upstairs and our server (dressed in a minions costume) had a pretty bad day. She was visibly upset when orders went wrong and would announce it half way before reaching the guest. One group sat down and she went over and they asked her how is she doing and the server replied ""well my tips have been crap all morning because orders have been messing up so that's how it's going."" It was so uncomfortable hearing that and being only 3ft away from the table. In another instance we heard her telling a group she apologized for their incorrect order and said ""it's not my fault, it's her fault. She messed up the order"" pointing to the other server (dressed in a devil costume) and left the section. We looked at the serve in the devil costume and she was visibly upset and looked like she was on the verge of crying. We felt soo bad. Lastly, our server was speaking to who seems to be the manager and complaining about how orders have been messing up all morning. In this situation, this should be handled at the back of the house. NOT in front of guests. Listen, I know we all have an off day but you deal with it privately and away from your guests. I work for one of the biggest restaurant groups in the city, and if this happened at any of our restaurants you would've been removed immediately. Don't make your guests feel uncomfortable, that's probably a part of the reason you weren't getting tips.",4,15,negative
211,"I love pizza in all its forms: NY style, New Haven style, and Chicago-style. This was certainly worth the wait. I ended up going online a few days ahead and getting on the priority list, which made getting a table on a Friday night only 15 mins.It is very crowded so don't expect much for elbow space. Our waitress was awesome and quickly got our orders in (because Chicago-style is 45 mins of cooking).  We ended up getting a small pepperoni pizza for two and it was the perfect size with leftovers and not feeling completely disgusting. The sauce was incredible and crust quite flaky. Highly recommend going!",6,3,positive
212,This is seriously the best pizza I've ever had in my life.  You want real Chicago deep dish?  Then forget Lou Malnati's. Forget Giordno's.  Come to Pequod's.  They cook the pizzas in cast iron deep dish skillets.  It gets served to you in the dish with all amazingly delicious crispy edges.  The pie is so full of the toppings you select.  We had a pizza with sausage and you can tell the sausage is home made.  This place is pretty big too.  You walk in and think the only tables are there on the main floor around the bar but the space goes back a ways and there's an upstairs.  It's a great space for sports viewing as there are TVs everywhere.  Pretty decent beer selection too.  We had to wait about a half hour for a table which was fine.  They have a space next door where you can order a drink while you wait.  Just expect to have to wait and plan ahead.,7,0,positive
213,"Ah where to begin! Chicago is notorious for their deep dish pizza and besides Lou's, I would recommend staying away from the Big 3 (Gino's East & Giordano's) because of Pequods and Art of Pizza. Don't get me wrong, the Big 3 are good, but I prefer Pequods over them any day. I have been here many times and Pequod's is one of my favorites in Chicago, but I ordered delivery for this review. Pequods is a official Blackhawks bar and it has a limited selection of beer on tap. It's two floors and the place is actually kind of old/grungy, but it really doesn't matter because you come here for the pizza anyways, right? In my opinion, Pequods has the best and biggest toppings in Chicago. It would probably rank as the heaviest deep dish pizza in Chicago! Their tomato sauce and bottom crust isn't the best, but it does it's job. To be honest, the bottom layer of crust is quite dry. The tomato sauce is a little wet, but it is flavorful. Lou's, Giordano's, and Art of Pizza have better sauce. But the best part about their pizza is the caramelized cheese crust! It looks burnt, but trust me is it glorious! I highly recommend ordering extra cheese as it gets applied to the crust. Two slices will definitely fill you up and it's about 2,000 calories. But it is worth it! Service is usually adequate and their appetizers are ok. I've had the Jalapeno poppers and cheese sticks, but they're average fried food. The salad was ok as well, but you should really save yourself for the pizza. Wait times can be very long at peak times so it's usually best to get on the preferred table list. Here are my rankings for deep dish pizza in Chicago: Art of Pizza, Pequods/Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Gino's East, and Nancy's Pizza. Piece Pizza actually might be my favorite in Chicago and it's New Haven style.",17,2,positive
214,"In the beginning, there were Mount Vesuvius tomatoes that inspired the pizza napoletana (my favorite pizza). Later in 1900's, her younger sister, New York-style pizza was born (my second favorite). Many years later, their giant big-boned Chicago deep-dish brother was delivered. This pizza snob dude tried four deep-dish pizza big names in Chicago so far, and I hereby dub Pequod's  my favorite. However, do you know what the best part is about Pequod's pies!! For me, it was those caramelized burnt ends!! People don't like their ''cornicione''. But I found myself eating them, non-stop. My criticism is they pour a lot of sauce into the pizza. So when you're working on it, the sauce will burst all over your face and most importantly your beard. Thanks to some awesome Chicagoan friends, I was invited to a small event over here. We were about 20 people. Michelle, the organizer, pre-ordered lots of pizzas. To be safe, I ordered a small thin crust cheese pizza, because I'm a part time vegan. Michelle said it was the best among all pizzas ordered!! I really liked it. The cheese amount was a generous Midwestern portion by default. I would've loved more crunch on the base. But you know how it is. The flavors were there, 4.2989899 stars. The waitresses were efficient but you can feel they were pressurized as it was so busy and crowded. The place is old and dim from inside. But who cares if you have a fancy photographer friend like Daniel to make photos look amazing!. Location by the far nicely crowded western side of Lincoln Park is so smart and full of life. I had much fun meeting with new yelp friends over here. Cool people. My buddy Alex A was a must to be present, as usual. PS. my 26K marathon runner buddy from New York LOVES this place. Would definitely come back for those caramelized cornicione.",18,5,positive

My only complaints are how crammed the inside is, and felt a little nickle and dimed (got a big order of cheesy garlic bread that came with no marinara which seemed odd and got charged for the mini cups they brought us when we asked, weren't told we'd get charged for each one either) Food wise though the pizza is delicious. Split... or at least tried to split a small with a girlfriend and we didn't even close to finish it.

216,"03/23/18 - Last night an unofficial Yelp event was held as a farewell party for our former Chicago CM Alex S at Peaquods Pizzeria @ 2207 N Clybourn Ave in Chicago.  In Alex's S. short stint as Chicago CM he has did a great job of bringing together some epic Yelp events.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank him and to wish him the best in whatever his future endeavors are.  It was a fitting tribute hosted by Michelle, Salena & Liang at Pequod's Pizzeria for Alex S.  I was honored to be one of the chosen to attend the farewell party.As far a Peaquod's pizza I love the caramelized crust on the perimeter of the pizza, but I'm not especially fond of the thick soft doughy interior of the pizza.  Like many of the pizza restaurants they have both thin & the thick doughy pizza crust which I got to try both last night thanks to the thoughtfulness of the 3 ladies that took the time to canvas the 20 or so people in attendance to try and find out what their preferences were on pizzas.  I mentioned to Michelle that while I appreciated the thoughtfulness of doing that, it is very difficult to please everyone and suggested maybe a vegetarian options for those non meat eaters & a mix of meat & other toppings as it is hard to cater to everyone's individual choices.  Naturally I was surprised when both Michelle & Liang told me my pizza with sausage, mushrooms, black olives & garlic was sitting on the table as requested.  Thanks to the ladies for organizing this event for Alex S.  We all want to wish the Best for Alex S in his future whatever that may beThis is the first time I ate at the Clybourn location so it was kind of cool to see the restaurant which is a 2 story restaurant.  As I arrived I ran into Sarah S outside.  As we walked in we were told they had 2 groups upstairs in the 2nd floor dining area.  This is where we met our fellow Yelpers.  When it came time to pay the girls were working out the bill when Ahmed A came up and snatched the bill out of their hands and paid the bill for the group.  Thank you Ahmad That was a very unexpected and generous thing to do. I give 5 stars + for the cool Yelp people at the event, but only 4 stars for the pizza.  Very good pizza, but my favorite pizza is Lou Malnati's butter crust.",16,3,positive
217,"Pequod's makes the best deep dish pizza. I left off the elusive 5th star for one reason, well actually two. ..extra sauce. ..extra cheese. Make sure you order both & load up on toppings. Pequod's isn't at it's best with simple one or two ingredient pies. These mandatory additions (which should be standard) will make all your deep dish pizza dreams come to fruition. Let me explain.Pequod's doesn't serve the traditional Chicago deep dish pizza with a thick cheesy layer, instead there's a deliciously crisp bread-like crust with a caramelized cheese rim (see pics, it's not burnt despite the color). The extra sauce and cheese balances out the thick crust. All the standard toppings are offered and always fresh. No arugula, artichokes or pesto drizzles if that's what you're into. Just delicious satisfying pizza. Be forewarned the cook time is 45mins to an hour, but well worth the wait. Some tips suggest placing your pizza order with the hostess as you wait for a table. This was not an option during my last three visits. I suggest ordering wings and sit tight until perfection arrives.",10,1,positive
218,"Came in for my mom's birthday on a very rainy and icky Saturday. I had made a table request online the day before, which I would recommend because it seems to be crowded at all times, including 2:30pm on a Saturday.We came about 20 minutes earlier than our reservation and they were still able to seat us after only about 5 minutes of waiting. We grabbed drinks at the bar, I was pleasantly surprised to see they had Krombacher on tap.We were seated on the main floor towards the back, but they do have an upstairs that gets more natural light and looks to be a little more spacious. The seating is close-quarters for sure, but nothing super uncomfortable. Frankly, it is a pizzeria that has a bar and is not fancy, pretentious or otherwise, no frills.We kept it super simple and just ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza. We were advised it would take 45 minutes, but it came out in less than 30 minutes, so that was great!The pizza itself was fantastic! As others have said, it is not exactly like other Chicago deep-dish/stuffed pizza. This has a caramelized crust that is crispy enough to add good texture, but not like other deep dish where you need a knife to cut through it. I liked the sauce a lot, it has a little sweetness to it. Really a fantastic blend of what seemed like good quality ingredients. Not skimpy on pepperoni, cheese or sauce, everything came together wonderfully and we had a lot to take home from a large between 3 people. It's filling but I actually would argue not as ""stuffing"" as traditional deep dish.Our server was good, we didn't really need much, literally just ordered the pizza and that was about it.Great spot for a unique pan pizza, nothing but good things to say about Pequod's, I'm a big fan.",20,3,positive
219,"I will start this by saying I love their pizza. We order from Pequods almost once a week. It's our favorite pizza delivery in Chicago and has been for the past few years.However, the last four deliveries have all had issues. A few weeks ago, they forgot to bring the delicious, amazing ranch we paid for. Sure, it's only ranch, but it complements the food so well :)The next time, the toppings were wrong. We ended up calling and the manager reluctantly fired a new pizza and we waited another hour-ish for the correct pizza.Last weekend, after waiting almost 2.5 hours, we found out the girl who took our order entered the wrong phone number. The driver came back and told us he was here an hour ago but couldn't get ahold of us since the wrong number was entered.Tonight, they once again forgot the ranch we paid for. I sent them an email outlining what has happened the past four times and received what most would consider a garbage response. The manager/owner/whoever sent incomplete sentences basically saying that they have a new delivery ordering system and they are working out the kinks. Sorry about that. In the end, I would NOT recommend ordering delivery from them for some time. If you need some Pequods, dine in or pick it up. Their delivery system now is whack.",8,6,negative
220,"Finally, after trying 4 different pizza places in Chicago, this takes the cake for the best Chicago pizza I've had! I think this is what we envision when we say ""Chicago deep dish pizza"". However, it did remind me of Pizza Hut's pan pizza since I think they use a pan pizza base/structure, but different crust and sauce of course. It made me appreciate pizza hut's pan pizza! LolWe ordered sausage and pepperoni on our pizza and let me tell you, the sausage here is amazing! So definitely order sausage if you can.",3,0,positive
221,Ok so I eat here all the time! I LOVE THIS PLACE and I NEVER got around to review it. So today I called to make a call ahead order and I was told they no longer do that. Mind you I am traveling an hour to eat here So I called back and asked if I ordered for a pick-up could I eat it there and his response was that He doesn't see a problem with it especially since they weren't  busy or there wasn't a wait. So I gave it a go I am giving them a 2 star review because the food is amazing but today I experienced the worst management encounter in my life.Upon arrival I told the hostess I was there for a pickup. She walked away to check on my order then when she came back I asked her if I could just eat there since there were MULTIPLE open tables and NO wait. I was told that we couldn't eat our pickup pizza there even though we were going to order drinks and app and of course  tip the server.The woman who spoke with me was very rude and after canceling the order she told me I was able to eat it there. UNBELIEVABLE!Pictures are from my last visit. Obviously not today since we left.Also I brought my cousin who is in from the Army FROM GERMANY to eat here and he was very upset that we couldn't eat here BUT we ended up going to a VERY well known establishment couple miles away for Pizza Pot Pie that he LOVED!,2,3,negative
222,Walked from our hotel for a city tour walk to eat at Pequod's.  We had to have the traditional pan pizza.  It is a great family neighborhood restaurant that you will love.,2,0,positive
223,Two thumbs up for Pequod's Pizza. Cool little old brick building with a hip vibe. The service awesome.,1,0,positive
224,"The outside of the building looks a little run down and there isn't a place inside to wait and there weren't a lot of parking options. We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated and there was a sign that said a pizza would take 60 minutes to make. We were seated upstairs and decided to order drinks and apps while we waited for our pizzas to cook. The app combo comes with jalapeño poppers, breaded mushrooms, fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks.  It was pretty run of the mill as far as fried appetizers go. We also ordered cheesy garlic bread which I don't recommend (soggy bread, not much flavor.) Our pizzas were ready in under 60 minutes. The deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and onions was AMAZING. Best deep dish pizza I've had hands down. The second pizza we ordered was thin crust with onions, pepperoni and ground beef and was pretty decent. Side note: the bottle of wine we ordered was opened before it reached the table, which was kind of weird. And our glasses weren't dirty, but they were smudged and not the cleanest... Overall, in the future we will definitely be ordering in from this place but likely won't dine in again.",6,6,negative
225,"This review is strictly for their delivery services. It has nothing to do w the quality of their pizza.For the past month or so, I have ordered a pan pizza every weekend. I love it. I crave it and they are reasonably priced. However... each time I have ordered it, they'd f*^%#} it up. Literally, every. Single. Time. Two of the four weekends they forgot part of the order listed on the ticket attached to the box.One time they made It with wrong ingredients so I had a pizza delivered and had to wait another 2 hours for the correct one to be delivered.And the 4th one they delivered my pizza to the wrong address so we had to wait longer again.All of these issues stemmed in the last month or so. We never had them before. We've emailed management and they respond as if they don't care with phrases like, ""wish I knew what happened..."" uhhhh I just told you? But okay. As my favorite pizza place in Chicago, I may need to hunt for a new one. A more reliable one. This is to the point where I feel I am sacrificing what I really want (my order) for whatever they feel like giving me. And that's no way to order pizza on Friday night! If you're ordering from them. Quadruple check your order on the phone and if they arrive without it.... be ready to wait another two hours for the (fingers crossed) correct order to show up!",9,3,negative

227,"Having only had Lou's when visiting Chicago in the past, I was looking for deep dish pizza at a location that was favored by the locals and was not just a large local chain. My sister suggested Pequod's having been there before and I'm glad we came here.We were lucky to easily find the table as the 45 minute wait for the pizza is agonizing when you are starving! We ordered a medium deep dish pizza and customized one half while leaving the other as a cheese pizza. The pizza was amazing, the crust in particular was delicious. The servers were attentive even as the place got busier the later it got. Definitely, would recommend Pequod's to anyone looking to try deep dish pizza while in town.",7,1,positive
228,"Finally made it to Pequod's when an old friend was visiting from out of town, and just like everyone says, it is GOOD.It did take the full 35 minutes or so for the pizza, but that's to be expected with any deep dish. They just have their standard sizings of cheese pizza, and you can add whatever toppings you want - so we got peppers and mushrooms.  The whole place smells amazing, and when the pizza got to the table we were all practically drooling over it. The cheese is so meltey and perfect when they serve the slices onto your plate, and they've got a solid proportion of sauce to cheese to crust.  The best part is probably the caramelized edges of the crust, but the whole pizza eating experience was all in all amazing.If you like deep dish - go to Pequod's.",6,1,positive
229,"Although I'm not the biggest deep dish fan, this was definitely my favorite over Lou's and Giordano's. Their pizza is lighter and has an awesome crispy crust. It also feels much more traditional and less of a tourist trap than some of the other chains. The only time we eat deep dish is when people come to visit from out of town. This will be our go-to spot from now on!!",3,1,positive
230,"What to get: pan pizzaService: 5/5Atmosphere: Casual, sports barWait: 45 mins (Saturday 11:30AM for 1)The Experience:Another out-of-towner trying to get a taste of that legendary Chicago, deep-dish pizza. I should specify that this is a pan pizza, where it has a caramelized crust rather that a fulling-encasing thick crust. That extra crunch at the bottom of your pizza is what you're after.Even when it just opens, you're going to have to wait. It gets crowded easily and even as a solo diner, I nabbed one of the few spots at the bar. The waiting is actually for the pizza to cook. A personal size takes about 45 mins. Just choose your toppings, have a drink, and wait.The staff is attentive since they know you'll be waiting. The name of the game is waiting here. If you can do that, you're rewarded with a stellar pizza. A personal size is filling enough for 1 person. I even took some home to eat later, but it is similar to eating a pie. Best part is that crunch from the crust with the gooey cheese melting all over.It's a wonderful must-try if you're in town.",5,1,positive

232,"Attention, attention!! I don't care who you talk to or what they say, Pequod's Pizzeria is by far the absolute best pizza in Chicago.  I am not exaggerating. There's nothing else like it! I've ordered delivery and dined in at this fabulous locally owned establishment and I've never been disappointed. While the wait may be long depending on the day and time, it's totally worth it. Do yourself a favor and ignore the hoopla surrounding the larger pizza chains around the Windy City and eat pizza like a local!I'm pretty basic when it comes to my pizza options... I tend to stick with a plain cheese pizza and I douse it with red chili flakes and dip it in ranch. This pizza is what I believe most people would describe as a pan (deep pan) pizza, however it's truly unique and unlike any other pan pizza I've had. Not only in Chicago, but anywhere! The crust is buttery and caramelized to perfection! The crunch is amazing and gives it the texture you need when it's topped with ooey gooey cheese and red sauce. So delicious and filling. You're welcome! I can just picture the huge smile that will spread across your face as you devour your first Pequod's pizza... or your 50th (wink, wink)!",12,2,positive
233,"Tiny neighborhood pizza place with a LOT of hype. We were lucky to snag a seat at the bar while we waited for our table but that's where the good ended. We were seated at a high top next to the host stand and it just felt like we were in everyone's way. Everyone waiting for a table was just staring at us eat...not the most fun.The pizza was tasty but not my favorite. We ordered the deep dish with pepperoni and sausage. The pepperoni had great flavor but the sausage was heavily flavored with fennel. I was't a fan. If I lived nearby, I would give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",6,2,negative
234,"Insanity. Pure insanity. This place is fantastic and the pizza was the best we have had on our trip. The cheesy burned cheese goodness on the edge was fantastic. Thankfully it was the Blackhawks official bar, it was empty and had no wait. LETS GO PREDATORS!!!!",4,3,positive
235,"Is there a TEN STAR button?!?!?!   Noel was freaking AMAZING and it is the best pizza I have ever had in my 37 years on this green earth!    The meatball app warmed me up enough for the wait and the House dressing was fire!   But I swear best cheese, best pepperoni, best crust and unreal amazing customer service.  No question no doubt I'll go back!",7,2,positive
236,"Love love love Pequod's! This has to be my favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago. I'm not a local, I'm not a native. Just a foodie Yelper who loves Chicago style pizza!I've had the typical places like Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, which are also good in their own rights. But when you pile your cheese high over the edge of the dough that it crisps up and makes each bite of the crust tantalizingly cheesey, how can you say no?I'm a classic with the sausage, which here consists of giant blobs of pure deliciousness and the best kind of kick to your encasd meat. They pile the toppings on sky high so you don't have to worry about bring jipped of the $2+ per topping. Honestly, my most recent visit consists of sausage, pepperoni, and green peppers and I had more toppings in each bite than dough, which is not a bad thing.Whenever I get meat toppings, I find that there's always enough sauce, but looking at the table next to me last night, who got all veg, I did notice it was a little drier than ours, so I can see why people ask for extra sauce.Even with the hour long wait to get a table and 30-40 min for the pizza, I still love it here. I do say, plan ahead - cause waiting nearly 2 hrs will get to you. I come hungry, but not hangry, and grab a small appetizer to share to tide free table over. 4 people, a medium pizza with app combo was about $10 a person. Definitely worth the trip!",14,2,positive
237,"The best. This is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago and I've lived here 30 years. I've gotten into arguments with people about which is THE BEST (between this and Lou Malnatis) but in those debates Pequads is always part of the discussion. It speaks for itself as you'll always find a line out the door of people waiting to get a table. It's a short wait (and they have a seated indoor place next door you can wait in), but worthwhile one. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality Chicago pizza.",5,0,positive
238,"I've had Pequod's a couple times before (dine-in and delivery) but decided to stop in today for their awesome lunch special deal before a movie. For $4.95 you get a personal sized cheese pizza and a fountain drink-- it's an amazing deal! I added giardiniera and pepperoni (each topping was 80 cents) and a side salad ($2.50 extra). When it comes to Chicago pizza, I'm typically a diehard Lou's girl but I was really impressed by Pequod's-- especially for the price! The personal sized pizza had a lot more of the crunchy cheese on the crust that Pequod's is famous for compared to the larger pies. I would skip the side salad next time as it had not been spun properly and left a huge puddle of water in the bottom of my bowl. That amazing lunch special does not include any refills on drinks. My server never offered me another one which I gladly would have paid for. I'm in the service industry so I definitely understand the woes of a lunch shift where everyone is spending $5. It certainly wouldn't deter me from returning. Overall, this was by far my favorite Pequod's experience. I will go back next time I'm going to Regal Webster.",8,1,positive
239,"After a 2.5 hour wait...yes we hung out for that long, we were not disappointed. We had individual an pizzas; mine was sausage and mushroom and friend's was peppers, garlic, and pepperoni. The caramelized crust/cheese is what makes this Pequod's. Hip joint with upstairs area. Loud when crowded! Definitely will bookmark and be back next time in Chicago!",0,3,positive
240,"I had seen Pequod's on the Food Network and it was also recommended by locals, so I had to give it a try while in town for the race on the previous day.  I came in during lunch, so I had the lunch special, which includes an individual stuffed cheese pizza and drink (no refills) for $4.95 + tax. An extra topping is 80 cents, so I got bell peppers.  The lunch special is available weekdays from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM.  You definitely cannot beat that deal anywhere in town, especially for the quality of the pizza that you get.The pizza itself is very good, just like everybody says!  It has a nice buttery crust that is nicely caramelized on the edges.  Despite all of the rave reviews, I think it is tied with Lou Malnati's for the best Chicago style stuffed pizza, which are both definitely better than Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, and Giordanos.  However, Pequod's is definitely cheaper than all of the others, especially for the lunch special.  Pequod's stuffed pizza also has a higher crust to toppings ratio than the others, but that is OK with me...I know some prefer less crust and lots of cheese like Lou's prepares.Since it is so good, you can expect a wait since the dining area is quite small, unless you sit at the bar, in which case there is no wait if there is available space.  It is also very dark inside, and also very noisy and crowded.  If you are claustrophobic, you will not enjoy the dining area. People were bumping into me while I was trying to eat.If you are a fan of Chicago-style stuffed pizza, I highly suggest Pequod's.",14,3,positive
241,"This deep dish pizza is really good but is heavy. Got the deep dish pizza with Italian beef. It was really good, my critic to the pizza though is the crust is heavy and with all the sauce and beef it just keeps adding on. But to make up for the crust is the upper crust of the pizza is amazing. They melt cheese on the top crust and it looks burnt but is not and is to die for.",4,2,positive
242,"Soooooo good!!! I think they have the best pan pizza (deep dish).Ordered half fries, half wings, tossed salad, and a small pan (cheese, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms).Everything was amazing.The side crust is carmalized so it's basically a cheese crust. The bottom crust is more doughy so it's more of a thick toast than a regular pizza crust.",2,0,positive
243,"Yes this pizza is excellent.  However, I am just not Into the signature burnt crust.  Admittedly I totally inhaled three slices of deep dish pepperoni and mushroom.  And the scale showed it the next day.  This pizza IS excellent.  It all comes down to personal preference.",2,0,positive
244,"Where do I begin!? let's start off by saying that I've heard nothing but great things about this place.. yet have had two crappy experiences. Two weeks ago, after boating we decided to order some pizza, everyone raved about pequods, so I decided to call in an order. After being on hold for 20 min, I finally got through and placed an order for 2 large pizzas. The girl said 2 hours for delivery.. WTF? Fair enough.. we shall wait, over 2 hours pass and nothing.. I call, on hold for 10 min, finally to have he girl say .. ""Sorry, we canceled your order, we don't deliver to the harbor anymore"" WHAT!!????? We've been waiting for 2 hours!? Why didn't someone call me or say that!? She apologized and hung up, mind you. I fought with them and my bank for a week because they STILL CHARGED ME! Fast forward to last night. Again, we want pizza after boating. We see our boat neighbors had pequods and they said it was delivered .. WTF! I call in an order and they said ""we don't deliver to the harbor."" I say, my neighbors just got delivery! She puts me on hold then processed to take my order... Like REALLY! They delivery when they want!? Anywho... I place an order and her quoted TWO HOURS! We wait, we wait and finally our BURNED PIZZAS ARRIVE! 2 hours and $80 later, our pizza arrived, everyone was super excited and starved and we open the boxes to three burned pizzas. LIKE WOW. Had to eat around the burned crust. Super disappointing .. and I ordered HOT wings and got BBQ. What a JOKE. Will never order again and will make sure to tell all of my dock neighbors to not bother with this establishment.",3,6,negative
245,"During my short trip to Chicago I had a tough decision deciding which deep dish pizza spot I would visit. I ultimately boiled down the choices to either Lou Malnati's or Pequod's and ended up picking Pequod's. Pequod's is not located in the touristy area of Chicago so I ended up having to catch an Uber here. Not wanting to wait a long time, my friend and I decided to stop by around opening time @ 11. We were quickly seated upstairs upon arrival. Our waitress was very friendly and was very attentive the whole time we were there. I opted for the personal pan pizza with green peppers, sausage, olive, and mushrooms. Keep in mind that toppings are not free of charge so it can quickly add up. The pizza came out within 10 minutes piping hot. It's worth mentioning that their personal pizza's don't come in the skillet. The thing that stood out to me most about the pizza at Pequod's was definitely the crust and the tomato sauce. The tomato sauce tasted very fresh and the crush was not too overwhelming. The toppings I opted for were not overcooked and paired well with the pizza. At the end of my meal I was glad that I was able to try out a Chicago deep dish pizza and throughly enjoyed it.Overall I had a positive experience from food to service at Pequod's. If I were to be 100% honest though I personally prefer NY pizza compared with the Chicago deep dish. The deep dish got a bit tiring for me near the end of my meal. If it's your first time in Chicago as a tourist, I would highly recommend trying out a deep dish pizza. I can't compare between Lou's or Pequod's but I'm sure neither one would disappoint as they both have very positive reviews on Yelp.",15,3,positive
246,"How have I never been here before!.... it still strikes me to say this, but they're... *taking a momentary pause. not for drama. more because it still hasn't sunken in, yet* .... I think I like Pequod's more than Lou Malnati's.I'm actually sad that I haven't been here sooner.I'm actually resentful that nobody's told me sooner.I'm actually pretty angry because I could have had much more Pequod's in my life, and what if my life had been over before I never even tried them.And maybe I'm in denial, and just haven't had a good pizza fix lately, as if being Chicago-born doesn't entitle me to a bit of pizza-coinnoisseur-ness, and I've shamed other 90'kids TMNT lovers by having denied myself such ooey-gooey-goodnesss..... I think these are stages of grief.BUT OH, HOW THIS PIZZA MAKES MY HEART SOAR!to find out that they sometimes have a 3-hr wait, makes perfect sense. That it has an adjacent bar next door, which is the DEDICATED space for waiting for your table --- also makes perfect sense. No... it's not pretentious. Pequod's is just that serious. This is like the Disney World for pizza, where you look forward to it, and expect the wait (on top of 45 min cook-time wait) because standing in line earns your right to taste the Pequod glory.OK ok I'm really over-embellishing.. it's just that Chicago is so rampant with pizza, that it remains difficult to be impressed.  But even their tomato soup was bomb dot com! ... and I sure love my tomato bisque from Panera, but DANG. it was slurptastic.... Even the leftovers were just as amazing. It's nice because their crust is crispy all throughout, unlike other competitors that can rave about a butter crust, that you have to commit to a slice to get to that tasty finisher at the end.  Every bite has that buttery finish.Idk. IF you haven't yet, you're missing out. I recommend a party only of up to 4 people so you don't have to wait, and to go at an off-time (like during the week, or before/after typical dinner service).  If you can eat 9 or later, I think that would be prime time to come during the week. Wow. I just can't say enough great things, and I'm already salivating, waiting on an excuse to come back.",16,9,positive

248,"5 stars for the pizza. 3 stars for the service. We arrived in Chicago for a short three day vacation and wanted some good Chicago style pizza. Upon recommendation, we gave these guys a try. We ordered a few standard appetizers which were pretty good with how basic they were. Then on to the main dish, the Chicago style pizza. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. We kept it simple with pepperoni, sausage, peppers and onions; and we were not disappointed. From the large chunks of toppings to the buttery crunchy crust. Words can't describe the awesomeness of this pizza. I highly recommend the pizza here. Trust me, you will not be sorry.",7,2,positive
249,"From the outside it looks small but when you go in boy is it spacious!! Folks had been telling me for years about the pie at Peaquods but being brand loyal to other Chicago pizzerias I paid them no mine. The unique thing about Pequods in my mine is the carmelized crust on the deep dish. The sauce has a nice balance as far as zestiness. Ate some deep dish, ate some pieces of thin crust. Enjoyed my Coca Cola! Refills were done promptly. Had a reservation with a tremendous group of people and we all enjoyed ourselves.I think it's neat how Pequods has a good reputation but it isn't of the old guard of Chicago deep dish places. It signals to the world that the torch has been passed to a new generation.",8,0,positive

Mozzarella Sticks were very good.We ordered two pizzas and, while they were good, I cannot say they were great. The caramelized crust was good but I would not say it made the pizzas. I am a big fan of Lou Malnati's and, in my opinion, I would choose a deep dish sausage from Lou's over this. The big question is would I come again? Taking into account the wait, the pizza and the cost = No. For me Pequod's is one and done.",5,0,positive
251,"I'm from the area, and I have always thought deep-dish is gross. Pizza often makes me feel sick due to an excess of cheese and bread, so I only eat it if I know it will be worth it to feel terrible later. This stuff was the s**t. Not exactly deep dish like other places, but a deep pan pizza with a large amount of the toppings you ask for. I was surprised by how good it was and by the insane amount I ate of the spinach and onion I got - was also glad we got an appetizer as the wait is long (although they are very clear and up-front about it). I used to tell tourists that they were the only ones who liked deep-dish and locals thought it was meh, but it turns out I'm a fool who was just going to the wrong place. One star off because the A/C does not seem to be working there and it was crazy hot.",7,7,positive
252,"Came here with some friends after the last day of Lollapalooza (Sunday night) a few weeks ago. We got in at 11:30 and Pequod's closes at midnight, so the owner requested us to order our deep dish to go. We were fine with that, given most of us (not me :D) had work the next morning, and so we ordered two pizzas among the six of us to take back home.We waited at least half an hour for the pizza, which is understandable (not sure if this is the average wait time) because it's deep dish and needs to bake for awhile. A few minutes after we ordered, another party of 6 came in, sat at a table (we were sitting at the bar to wait), and ordered.One of our pizzas came out around midnight, but not the other. We had to go up to the cashier and ask him if our other pizza was ready. He went back into the kitchen for another few minutes, to which we were terrified that they had forgotten to even start our pizza, but then came out with it.As we were leaving, we saw food being served to the group that came in after us. I guess the owner was fine with that group eating in the restaurant rather than taking it to-go. We were fine with that too because we had our real lives to get back to in the morning, but I just thought it was odd, perhaps a little unprofessional.Our deep dish pizza was cold by the time we got back to our apartment (a 30-minute drive from Pequod's), but it tasted fine warmed up in the microwave and we were HUNGRY so it was good. It's not the best deep dish pizza I've had -- Zachary's here in Berkeley (Oakland) is still better -- but from what I've heard, Pequod's is better than Giordano's in Chicago.I'll probably come back in the future with enough time to spare before closing time.",12,1,negative
253,"You can't beat the $5 lunch deal at the best deep dish pizza spot in the city. While the tourists flock to Lou's and Giordanos, the true Chicagoans know that it's all about the crispy cheesy crust, the savory smooth sauce, and the toppings for days on what can only be described as ""crust with the perfect amount of pillowy, bready goodness while still remaining crunchy.""Pequod's is the best. Get there as early as you can to avoid waiting for 3 hours. Call ahead to start your pizza order so you don't have to wait 45 mins once you sit down. And get a side of ranch to dunk your 'za. Trust me on this one.",5,1,positive

My last visit was for the personal cheese deep dish and also a medium pepperoni.It is my regret to inform all the pizza aficionados my taste buds have either evolved to dislike the pizza, or they have revamped their portions, skimping out on the cheese, sauce and toppings.Most of the pizza was corn meal bread. It was absolutely disgusting, but the personal deal is 5 bucks or less.I ate half the personal pizza but couldn't find a way to finish it unfortunately.Restaurant didn't carry vinaigrette dressing for the small salad -- just oil and vinegar.

259,"I was pretty disappointed by Pequod's as this was my first time ever getting REAL Chicago Deep Dish pizza in Chicago. My friend who's an IL native suggested we go to Pequod's over the other deep dish places because she preferred them over Giordano's or Lou Malnati's. We showed up on a Monday right when they opened at 11AM and were seated right away in an empty (and dark) dining area. We each got an individual pizza (7"") which was a cheap $4.95 with the purchase of a soft drink for their lunch special. I asked the server for topping recommendations, who suggested sausage or pepperoni. So we each got one of those. The pizza took 40 minutes to cook, even despite being one of the first few customers in the restaurant. Not sure if that's the usual length of time it takes to cook the pizza or if the wait gets worse the busier the place. When it came out, it was un-applaudingly small and served in the original deep dish pan. Had a very dark, borderline-burnt crust which I assumed was melted cheese held under the broiler. You could get four ""slices"" out of that one individual size. The taste of the pizza itself: too saucy, not enough cheese, few chunks of sausage, and the crust was essentially like a plain dry-fluffy foccacia bread. You could say I was disappointed, as the only reference of deep dish I had previously was Uno's Chicago grill pizza which I have to say tastes better than this, though their tomato sauce is a little too sweet. Wouldn't say I was blown away by this one, and hope I can try a larger selection of REAL deep dish the next time I come back to IL.",9,6,negative

The Pequod's salad and garlic cheese bread as apps were great and came out quickly. The pizza took the expected 40 minutes and was cheesy, saucy, and crispy.",2,1,positive
263,"I knew it would be hard to find a favorite pizza joint with a short trip to Chicago. And I know I still have many more to try. But after many recommendations for this place and trying a hand few pizza joints, this one. Pequod's. Is BESTEST (ok maybe it's tied with Bonci but these are completely different places that  also should both open up in Houston... please?). I prefer cheesy pizza with a thick yet crispy crust and savory toppings. Toppings like Giardiniera. If you like mildly spicy, tangy type flavors, you better add this stuff because it's a pizza game changer. And just thinking of their lightly burnt caramalized crust makes me want to get back on a plane and Uber straight to pequod's. Great place to spend a Sunday watching football with fantastic pizza and beer.",7,2,positive
264,"I got mixed recommendations about Chicago's Deep dish pizza. Some of our friends recommended skipping it, others compared it to a heavy casserole. Our friend and host recommended that we try Pequod's Pizzeria. I'm glad that we did!This Chicago style pizza is deep dish is made with a caramelized cheese crust. So the crust is cheesy-burnt, the bread is light and fluffy and you get a massive amount of sauce and toppings! The small sausage deep-dish easily fed 3 of us (me, K and a friend). Other than that, the service was great. The setting is bar/pizzeria. There is more seating upstairs. If you reserve with priority seating requests, you cut your wait time in half! I definitely recommend this style of deep dish!",6,0,positive
265,"It looks like a deep dish pizza in pictures, but if the crust is 90% of the thickness, is it a true deep dish? That is exactly what you get with the pan pizza - a thick bread with sauce and toppings on top.. pretty much the opposite of how Gio's and Lou's does it. The worst part was that the toppings were not even cooked (probably because they were sprinkled on top rather than being baked into the pizza). Our mushrooms and onion were basically raw and was pretty nasty to eat tbh. The crust was also badly blackened and had a bad rubbery texture.. we couldn't even eat it.The Pequods salad is also extremely basic. It's just simple lettuce and onion topped with pepperoni and cheese in the shape of a whale. Not worth the $10.",5,3,negative

267,"YelpComments/Thoughts/Opinions/Suggestions:This is the local spot for pizza in the Windy City! I am a pizza lover so I had to try out this city favorite deep dish pizza. Food: I thought the pizza was good. The bread was very thick and toppings were all fresh. I do however wish my pizza had more sauce, cheese, and if the crust was more crispy then I think it'd be perfect ! Drinks: Full bar , upstairs and downstairs. This is probably super convenient for when the Cubs play! Ambiance: Very Chicago feel! I loved it. They have big screen TV's everywhere. They also played awesome music major throwback! Price: Super Reasonable!!!!! Location: Perfect, quaint little restaurant right on the outskirts of the city. Definitely a local pizza place. Parking: Street parking. It's Chi-town  people! Cool Features: Lots of Tv's. Upstairs and downstairs bar! Service: Excellent , very helpful and attentive.",13,0,negative
268,"Probably one of my favorite deep dish pizza places in Chicago.  It's hard to compare Pequod's to other deep dish joints, since this reminds me more of a pan pizza (which I guess is basically deep dish) but the crust is just different than the chains in Chicago.  The crust is fluffier, spongier, and more like bread than it's chain competitors.I really like that it's not a chain, locally owned, and there is only one in the city.  On the other hand, this makes getting a table sometimes difficult.  Going on weekdays and off hours helps with this.  Toppings are good, they have other appetizer options, but pizza is the way to go here.  Always been cooked well and never burnt, no complaints.",5,3,positive
269,"It really pains me to give Pequod's a 3 star review, given it's 5 star reputation. (With that being said, the experience as a whole was really closer to 2 stars, if I'm being honest. Our waiter, however, was so great he bumped it back up to 3 stars.)I went to Pequod's last night, which was a balmy 90 degree evening in Chicago. The restaurant didn't have AC and was laughably hot - we were using our menus to fan ourselves off! By the time the pizza came out, we were less than thrilled. The crust was a little soft & the veggies were a little under cooked. The sauce, drinks & service were all great. Will definitely try again, closer to winter.",7,1,negative
270,I was blown away. Was never a fan of deep dish but this place changed my mind. While the place was dingy and kinda cramped I will definitely be here again!!!!!,0,1,positive
271,"Definitely the best pizza place in Chicago. It's kind of a weird cross between a pan pizza and a few dish pizza. The crust is crisp and buttery like that of a pan pizza, but it's deeper and denser than a normal deep dish. That being said, I prefer it over all other deep dish or pan pizzas in Chicago. Our go to toppings are pepperoni, garlic, and onion.  We usually don't get garlic on our pizzas but someone recommended it to us and we've gotten it every time since!  However, if I had to pick one reason why this is my favorite, it's the crust! Smallish place, so I'm sure there could be long waits from time to time. We usually get it to go and max out on our couch at home.",6,1,positive
272,"This is a long overdue review. My friends were asking for food recommendations in Chicago and hands down, this restaurant is what the locals look for in deep dish pizza. Yes, be prepared to wait long but the great part is that they let you put your order in while you wait for a table. So once you are seated, your pizza is already cooking and waiting to be devoured. Don't be skeptical on how much a personal sized pizza can fill you up because my boyfriend and I underestimated and actually ended up ordering way too much. The deep dish pizza is so filling especially after ordering a generous amount of toppings. The crust is cooked to perfection, fluffy as a marshmallow but so much flavor in each bite. Just thinking about the pizza makes my mouth watery. Oh how I wish I could have my hands on a Pequod's deep dish pizza again... It really was love at first sight as you lift up a slice and all the cheese just oozes out.",5,1,positive
273,"Pequod's has the best pizza on earth, hands-down. Out of all the joints we have tried in Chicago, this one is the best. The sauce is perfect, not too sweet and very hearty. The burnt cheese crust is so much more delicious than we ever could have imagined. It doesn't taste burnt, just good. My favorite thing about Pequod's is that they don't skimp on toppings. If you order pepperoni, prepare for it to be completely covered - sometimes 2-3 ronis thick. I love it. It is my favorite stop in Chicago. Highly recommended.",11,0,positive
274,So I'm generally not a fan of pizza but I really enjoyed the deal they offered for lunch more than the pizza :P Def going to come back here because why not have a slice and soda for a price that won't hurt the bank account!,1,1,positive
275,"I cannot believe I waited so long to finally get here! Ugh. I miss it so much. I wish I could eat Pequod's for every meal of every day.First, let's talk about the infamous wait time...Spoiler alert! The wait time was non-existent when I went at noon on a Friday! Amazingness! Score! Woo hoo!Next, let's talk about the lunch deal...It's about $5 for a personal pizza and then you can add a side salad for an additional ~$2. Well worth it! Okay, the salad dressing... UNREAL! They have homemade ranch and it's the best. It was perfect for the salad and obviously for pizza dipping. The pizza is beyond epic. The caramelized crust is everything it is cracked up to be and more.And last but not least, the service and the atmosphere...Every single employee was so happy and friendly. The interior kind of made me feel like I was in a pub. Okay, so Pequod's is like a neighborhood pizza pub. Well... Not LIKE a neighborhood pizza pub. I guess it IS a neighborhood pizza pub!If you want to get an authentic Chicago pizza experience, Pequod's is a solid place to check out! Get there!",9,2,positive
276,"I don't know how I've lived in Chicago for this long without reviewing Pequods. I am proud to say that without a doubt, Pequods is easily my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. It's a little different from your typical Chicago deep dish, and honestly reminds me more of a round Detroit style pizza with a buttery crust, carmelized edges, and sauce on top. In any case, it's awesome. Recently I discovered they offer fresh garlic and Giardinara as topping options- not sure I'd get those two together but both are nice additions. They get crazy busy on the weekends but you can put your name in and get a drink or appetizer next door. During the week the wait is shorter, if at all, and they have a really great weekday lunch deal too. They are open late, and while they do deliver, I don't feel as though it (or any deep dish for that matter) travels well, so I recommend dining in. It's also a fun place to bring your out of town friends who have only been exposed to the big chains.",10,2,positive
277,"Hands down the best pizza in chicago! Born and raised here and yes it's better then Gino's East and Girodano's! If you love cheese, this is the place to be. The crust on the deep dish pizza is caramelized cheese! It makes the pizza! Plus the pizza is very affordable compared to other Chicago deep dish pizza spots. The lunch special is about 7 or 8 bucks for a personalized pizza and fountain drink. There's also typically a line in the evenings so if you're going with a larger group, be prepared for a wait.",5,0,positive
278,"stopped in here for st. patrick's day dinner. as a first-timer to chicago, i really wanted to try deep-dish. didn't really matter *where*, i just wanted *some*. my boyfriend's friend recommended this place in lieu of a lou malnati's or something more popular. i will say this place was absolutely, ridiculously packed with people. we waited about 30 minutes before receiving a beeper... then 30 more minutes for a table. then about an hour for our food. i knew going out ANYWHERE was going to be a bear, so i was patient. got a salad to start. it was underwhelming. but the pizza? LAWD. i got a small pan pizza with extra cheese, onions, MEAT FRIGGIN BALLS, and spinach. ughhhhhh. it was so good. it tasted like a casserole. the crust was divine... sweet and almost caramelized. i can't WAITTTTT to come back here. on a regular weekend.",7,1,positive
279,Literally my FAVORITE Chicago pizza spot! The Italian beef and giardinara is my go to. The pizzas are always perfect and super filling. I like to carry out because the restaurant itself can be very busy. It still tastes great but nothing beats fresh pizza straight from the pan in the restaurant.,5,0,positive
280,"Arrive knowing there is a long wait and no reservations nor a waiting list. Get a drink and watch one of the TVs while waiting for your buzzer to signal that your table is ready. Get a preview of the pizzas as they are delivered to the tables. There is a nice sized dining room and bar on the street level. However, there are stairs behind the bar that leads to the spacious upper dining room!  More TVs, windows and brick walls up here. Started off with the Piquad Salad which was packed with colorful veggies and dressing on the side; jalapeño poppers (not spicy, wish they were); mozzarella sticks (not impressed but teen son loved them). Ask for the marinara dipping sauce, it's really flavorful. While you endure the 50 minute wait for your pizza, the waitresses refill your drinks (complimentary soda refills!!).  Gave me time to organize my photos from the Chicago Auto Show. Impressive looking pizza!  Served piping hot and your first slice stays hot from first to last bite. And that's all I could eat because we had a lot of appetizers. But, this pizza is so good!  Love the burned edges on the crust. Added a unique flavor as it's not a ""burnt"" flavor, kind of sweet tasting.",12,1,positive
281,"As an out of towner hearing a lot of hype for this place, I must say I don't think it lived up to the hype food wise. I think it's a personal preference thing, my wife said if she could only have 1 pizza the rest of her life, this was it. I personally didn't care for the crust, it felt to me like pizza thats been left out, kind of stale. Like I said, it's a preference thing. I am giving them 4 stars however because they accidentally threw away the 1 slice we were taking to go when boxing it and they replaced it with a whole pizza. A+ service!",2,3,positive
282,"Really, really good deep dish pizza ; they're rated highly for good reasons. Not fine dine just a bar and great food.Highly recommended. The crust is absolutely the best part ...the crust should be eaten first the deep dish crust has the perfect savory with delicious burnt edges .The popular ones either load  too much cheese , too much meat or too much sauce. At Pequod's that was not the case.One of the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. The sandwiches are good as well the "" combo sandwich"" ( sausage and beef together ) are delicious.",13,0,positive
283,"Wow. This place lives up to the hype. We got mushroom and beef. Delish!We came at 4:45 pm found street parking right across the street and had no wait.

284,"I had a terrible experience their on Sunday.  I got off worked picked up my family and went to try their pizza. Was our first time we got there at 1645 and they were busy, we got sat immediately. Our server came up for us about 5-10minutes after sitting and by then we already knew what we wanted because we know deep dish usually takes a while. So we ordered apps and Pizza. The server told us it would take about 45 minutes for the pizza which we were okay with. After 45 minutes we started to wonder but tried to be patient. A table that came after us got their pizza before us so I called the server over and she said shes going to check what happened to our pizza. Keep in mind we've already waited a hour. She came back and said the pizza has only been 20 minutes I said that's not true then she checked and saw we ordered at 4.58. So she said shes going to get a manager and find out what happen. Another 10 minutes later she came and told us they burnt out pizza and it would take another amount of time for us to get another. By then we're starving so I asked her for the check for the soda and appetizers. She brought the check which still had the pizza on it. I told her I'm not paying for the pizza because we never got it. She removed it and we left. I just feel like it's terrible communication, she could've informed me about the status of our pizza.",4,2,negative
285,"Pequod's used to be the #1 spot for deep dish pizza. I'd bring relatives here, business clients, dates too. The kitchen integrity of work has declined. I've had several pies where the crust just fell right off so the pie didn't stay intact. Disappointing for sure but taste was about the same.",2,1,negative

After ordering a medium deep dish sausage & pepperoni, I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find a better deep dish in Chi town! Everything about this pizza was heavenly; the carmelized crust, the sausage, the cheese, the sheer thickness & weight of each slice, good gosh! This pizza was so good, I had it my last night in town and ziplock bagged the rest to take on my flight back to the west coast. As I'm writing this, I still have one piece left...Go try it, you will LOVE each bite.",5,1,positive
288,Pan pizza heaven! The Pequod Salad is also exceptional. Go early if dining in or do carry-out. We love the Morton Grove location.,3,0,positive
289,Great pizza and very unique to Chicago. The deep dish has a caramelized crust that is to die for. There are long lines most of the time but so very worth it.,1,1,positive
290,"I love this place, it is just extremely crowded if there is a Cubs game going on. The pizza is perfection!",2,1,positive
291,"This is not real Chicago deep dish pizza. It is pan pizza like from Pizza Hut. I do not like the spongey tasteless crust that comes mass quantity in too high a ratio to the sauce (strangely peppery) and cheese. I also hate anything remotely burnt, and burnt crusty cheese on the outside edges counts as burnt in my book. They also gave our order to the wrong table so we had to wait TWICE as long for them to bring us another one. The interior was cute, so there...that's ONE nice thing I can say about this place.",4,3,negative
292,"This place was just so-so. They obviously have a strong reputation in Chicago but in my opinion, the food was definitely not worth waiting 3 hours for. The only thing that I can truly say that I loved about this pizza was their burnt cheese crust. That was super delicious and the texture/flavor of the burnt cheese made the pizza. Other then that, I thought the sausage didn't have a ton of flavor and the sauce was just alright. Our party of 3 came in on a Saturday night so just be prepared to have a ridiculous wait if you come on a weekend night. We also had some pretty rude service towards the end of the night from one of the servers. I think I would definitely pass on Pequod's next time I'm in Chicago.",7,2,negative
293,"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars, but I couldn't, I felt like something was missing. Everyone I had spoken to while visiting Chicago recommended that I go to Pequod's because it was the best deep dish in Chicago. Maybe I was oversold, because I wasn't blown away. The deep dish here is good pizza, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this. I'd say its very similar to Lou Malnatis. The pizza itself is very shareable, a small was more than enough for two people. I'd probably stick with a standard cheese pizza, or some sausage, I don't think toppings mix too well with this deep dish. Everything was very reasonably priced, so you can have a great time for very cheap.",8,1,negative
294,Ordered their food and was so disappointed.  Their salad is literally a few pieces of lettuce and some slices of cheese and pepperoni.  Literally no effort; if I raided a grocery store during a zombie apocalypse I could make a better salad.  Also they forgot one of the expensive toppings on my pizza; may as well just buy a frozen pizza and assemble my own toppings.,2,5,negative
295,"Called ahead for a table request on Saturday but had no issues getting in at 12. The tables do fill up fast with every table taken around 1. We ordered 2 large pizzas (8 slices each) and both were amazing! The toppings are very plentiful, the sauce is great and the crust makes this pizza better than any other deep dish I've had. The place isn't glamorous but the smells hit you right when you walk in and you'll be anxiously awaiting yours to come. Definitely understandable how this place tops every persons deep dish pizza list!",9,2,positive
296,"Pequod's offers a bit of a twist on the traditional Chicago-Style pizza you would get at a Lou Malnati's or Giordano's.  Their ""burnt"" crust is something you'll either love or hate, but I am a fan, and most people I've eaten Pequod's with are as well.  Solid sauce and toppings, but I find the overall quality of the pizza to be a clear notch below Lou Malnati's and Pizano's in the fight for best in Chicago.",4,2,positive
297,"My brother raved about this place and took us here for some deep dish pizza while in town. And let me just say, it was amazing pizza!! The crust was thick and well done, but not overly done. And the toppings were a plenty. My SIL and I also shared the Pequod salad (a half order) and it was really good as well.Only downside is the service we had was terrible. The waitress never came back to check on us or refill our drinks throughout our entire meal. We got the deep dish pizza at least 15/20 mins before the thin crust, so our kids were starving...we had to even ask twice where the thin crust pizza was. We asked for a to-go box and the waitress brought us a completely flat (not put together) box and sort of tossed it on the table.Service aside, I would definitely go back if I am in town, because the pizza is really really good.",4,2,positive
298,"Amazing deep dish pizza! I have never been a huge fan of deep dish pizza so I was a bit hesitant to eat here! We came in around 7P.M on a Wednesday night and we were immediately seated on the second floor.We came as a group and ordered the full order of hot wings as an appetizer! They were loved at the table, spicy enough to satisfy you, but not enough to burn your mouth. I ordered a full order of a caesar salad and split it with my boyfriend. The salad was large enough for both of us and even had some extra to share with another person. However, the salad was very plain and only had 5 croutons on top of it! Another negative about the salad was that they give you the dressing on the side so you have to mix it! Do not get the salad, nothing special to it.We ordered two medium pan pizzas for the table. One was pepperoni and jalapeño, and the other pizza had meatball, Italian sausage and pepperoni (pictures attached). The pan pizzas were both big enough for a group of 5 people (2 children) and we even had to take some home! I highly recommend coming here!",9,3,positive
299,"Pizza was amazing!  We ordered the thin crust and deep dish.  They give you a generous amount of toppings on the pizza and unlimited toppings to choose from on their menu.   The restaurant is rather small so the wait was rather long..  we got there and they said that it would be a 45 minute wait and then another 60 minutes for the pizza to be prepared.  Get a small appetizer if you are hungry, but this pizza place is highly recommended !",4,0,positive
300,"Not only is the pizza one sloppy mess, but they show ZERO hospitality. We ordered a pizza to go, and within 5 minutes called to add wings and salad to our order. The woman on the phone said that they couldn't add anything, even salad, to our order after the pizza had gone in the oven! What? She was rude, short and irritable. We actually called 15 minutes later and placed another order with a different name to get around the system.  And on top of all this, they didn't even get my order right! Let me get an AMEN if you are done with this over rated, over priced, underwhelming sports bar. go cubs",2,2,negative
301,"Went here today with family (wife & 3 kids), after a artwalk & Lincoln Park revisit.  I've been seeing Pequod's, on YouTube & pizza review articles, as the best new reinvented Chicago style deep dish that beats out the old style by a mile!  Was planning on stopping here on our next family outing to Chicago and that's what we did.  After all the hype, was definitely  expecting this to be a winner for sure, but it was a big upset, like the Bears season opener against the Packers!Got there, they said it would be a 20 minute wait, waited 5 minutes and got seats, score!  Before we got seated, they said it would be 1 1/2 hour wait for pizza, understood as they were busy.  Got seated, server was quick with the drinks and refills.  Ordered 2 appetizers, they came blazing fast.  Server check-in was very impressive, definitely a seasoned pro.  And then the pizza came, under an hour for sure, very impressed with the speed... But this is where everything falls apart, pie looked fantastic when it landed on the table haven't seen anything like it before, saucey, cheesy, carmalizied edges, in your face ingredients, but what counts the most is the final follow through...The taste buds approval!...Which was a upset!  Crust, dry & thick, no flavor.  Sauce, no flavor, like tomato sauce from the can.  The carmalizied crust, nothing to cheer for, burnt cheese tastes better.  Overall, it's like eating a pizza on toasted Italian bread.Final thoughts...over hyped and nothing to cheer for.  I've been Chicago since age 7, and tasted it all, and this place should be at the bottom with nothing to cheer about....Just my opinion, there's a lot better spots out there that aren't hyped that you should check out before coming here...",17,5,negative
302,"This place has GREAT food! Stopped by on a Thursday evening about 630pm. The place wasn't packed and immediately got a table. They do have a sign at the hostess station saying pizza can take about 40 minutes, which we were ok with. In the meantime, ordered a couple of beers and wings. Buffalo wings are delicious! Just the right spiciness to savor the flavor and enjoy them. We ordered a medium thin crust and a personal deep dish. The thin crust is not very thin, almost had the ""regular"" hand tossed thickness to it, but very flavorful. If you're a fan of pepperoni the way we are, get extra of it. The top layer is nicely charred and crispy with tons of flavor. The deep dish crust is also nicely charred and crispy and gives the pizza that extra flavor to satisfy your taste buds. This place is known for their deep dish and I could see why...the mixture of that sauce with the cheese and pepperoni was superb! The only reason I'm give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I truly enjoy a thin crust, crispy pizza, and this was not like that. Nonetheless, everything was delicious and will definitely visit when I'm back in Chicago! Check it out!!",11,0,positive
303,"Yep. Yep.......Yep, Pequod's lives up to the hype. We waited a while for our seat and pizza, but that was to be expected. I love the collaboration with Whale Tail to drink through your wait time. Parking was pretty easy in the area and in the end the pizza was amazing. We split a small and it was too much for us. I will say I'm glad I ordered extra cheese! The cheese is amazing!",6,2,positive
304,"Worth the wait!! Get your spot in line, then go next door to Whale Tale while you wait (30-45min for us on a Saturday evening). The bar is owned by the same people, so even if you aren't finished with your beer before the table is ready, they'll radio over and hold your table. This pizza is a MUST when you're in Chicago. Authentic deep-dish. Not too much cheese or too much sauce, and the perfect amount of crunch in the crust. Pequod's salad was a great choice as well. Very friendly waitstaff. Four of us shared a pitcher, a salad, and a large pizza with more than enough food to go around. We creeped on a guy sitting at the next table over who had some pesto ravioli that looked pretty delicious as well!",9,0,positive
305,"What can I say? Pequads is one of a kind when it comes to pizza in Chicago. Not to say that the Lou Malnati's and Giordano's aren't amazing, because they truly are; but if you haven't made your way over to pequads yet you are seriously doing yourself a disservice. Brace yourself, they don't take reservations and because they're so amazing they almost always have a wait. They do however offer what they call priority seating. This means if you know you're planning to come, they'll take your party's name and size and you pretty much get to cut to the front of the wait line when you arrive. We did this last night when we were here for a party of 5, and despite having a crowd waiting at the door, we were seated immediately. They have a well stocked bar available (also great during your wait for a table) and solid appetizers. Obviously the token item here though is their pan pizza. The crust is out of this world. It's got a crisp, caramelization to it that IMHO almost single handedly makes this my favorite pizza in Chicago. Furthermore, their toppings are baller. My favorite is the sausage and giardiniera. Yes, it's got a bit of a kick to it, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy/hot foods and still can't get enough of this. I've heard their Canadian bacon topping is also out of this world. Do yourself a favor, get to pequads ASAP.",12,1,positive
306,"Went here for dinner with my friend after seeing a movie at Webster Place Theater. I had my name put on the priority seating list before the movie and afterwards it was only a five minute wait. The service was great, our waitress checked on us frequently. The food was excellent , we had an antipasto salad and a pan pizza. Just some of the best pizza in Chicago and I have plenty of experience in that category. I found legal free parking in the area, but that was at 4 pm. Had a great time, highly recommended.",6,0,positive
307,"A Chicago staple that completely rocks. Recently waited on a Sunday for an hour and didn't eat until 10 but Pequods is 100% worth the wait. Their little buzzers still work 2 doors down at the Whales Tale bar and across the street at Barnes and Noble if you need to kill time and don't wait to wait inside the restaurant. For how busy they were, the service was great, the pizza was delicious and we left fat & happy. Good beer list. Pro tip: extra sauce. Do it. Our bill was about 60 bucks between three people and we got the Caesar, beers and a large pan. Super reasonable!",6,1,positive
308,"Being newish to Chicago a few people had recommended Pequod's so I gave it a try.Overall the pizza was pretty damn delicious. A thicker yet airy dough, flavorful sauce, plenty of topping options and a very delicious crispy crust. I do however think there could have been more cheese. With deep dish/pan I just expected it to be cheesier. I appreciated the selection of appetizers and salads. Since the pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook it was nice to have something to eat while we were waiting for the main dish. And although I didn't get desert, it was also nice to see that a pizza place had so many options for sweets. Service was great. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us during the appropriate times. For a Tuesday night in early spring we waited about 20ish minutes to get a table around 6 o'clock. I'd say the earlier you can get there the better chance you have of not waiting in line for super long. And if at all possible try to avoid the tables by the door. Large groups can form while people wait for a table and it just feels awkward having people so close to you while eating. Even the waitress was annoyed as she was trying to work her way through the crowd to get to her patrons. And at one point people were literally leaning on the chairs at our table while we ate. I get it, it's cold outside but really do you have to be right on top of me as I eat dinner?",15,6,positive

312,"Coming to Chicago, my main mission was to try deep dish pizza. After asking recommendations from many locals for places to try, I decided to come here.I came during lunch and it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait. I got the lunch special which is a personal size pan cheese pizza with a soft drink. I decided to add spinach on half of the pizza to try.It did take a while for our pizza to come but they do everything fresh to order and there was a large group ahead of us so I didn't mind as much.My first bite into the pizza was amazing. I love the crunch of every bite I took as well as the balance between sauce, cheese and dough. It wasn't too cheesy, or sauce, or doughy, it was perfect ratio. I dont know how they keep the outside part of the pizza to be crunchy but the inside was still soft and doughy but it was good. The only critique I had was that there was literally only 4 pieces of spinach on my half side and had to pay extra for it.Overall, it was a good pizza and I can see this as my go to pizza if we have this in Washington.",11,1,positive
313,"O...M...G....The best pizza, period.  The crust, wow.  What other deep dish pizza can you think of where you can pick up the slice and eat it with your hands without it going everywhere?  Crispy bottom with carmelized cheese around the crust that makes it amazing.  Service is good, not great, but the food makes up for it.",5,0,positive
314,"Delicious pizza! The restaurant is bigger inside than it seems since there is an entire upper level with seating. Pizza does take about 40 minutes but they let you know that up front. The sides look like it's black and burnt but it's really crisp and delicious and does not at all taste burnt. Pizza is a bit on the pricey side with toppings being about $2.50 more a piece. I do wish the pizza had a little more cheese to it, so next time I may order it with extra cheese. All in all it was delicious and we will definitely be back.",4,0,positive
315,"The best pizza in the effing world. I live in New York and I've traveled through Italy. I've eaten a lot of pizzas in a lot of styles. Nothing can top this pie. I had this pizza for the first time at the Morton Grove location well before the Food Network makes it one of the top five pizzas. Now when I visit Chicago, I come to this location because it's way more convenient and the pizza is the same. The wait is always insane but it's worth it. This visit, I came at 4:30 to beat the rush. I was seated immediately but told that my pizza would take 45 minutes from the time I ordered. This was good - I've waited over two hours just to get a table before. I'm not adding anything new by gushing over the caramelized cheesy crust. It's well established that that crust is what sets it apart. The dough to topping ratio is also on point, and the sauce has the tiniest hint of spice which makes all of the flavors sing. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've dreamed of this pizza.",8,2,positive
316,"Any time we make a trip downtown we have to stop here even if it's just to pick up a pizza to go. Love the pizza, the burnt cheese crust and the piles of pepperoni that is on it! It's pretty much always busy but there's a reason for that...it's delicious!",2,0,positive
317,"Delivery/take-out review - I've never eaten in, the wait is always atrocious.Overall: Great pizza, but it can be hit or miss in terms of the waiting periods for whether or not its worth it.The good: When it's good, it's REALLY good. Hot and fresh, its on top with the best of Chicago. The carmelzied crust is signature goodness, and the thin crust is really good too. They pile the toppings on high, the sauce ratio is plentiful, and the meat is always loaded. The crust is thick and crunchy.The not-so-good: On one occasion, the super bowl, the order was terribly late and incorrect. Not sure whether to blame doordash or Pequods. Also, if the pizza is late and cold, it's not nearly as divine.",12,4,positive

320,"Whenever we mentioned to our Lyft/Uber drivers that we had a dinner date at Pequod's Pizzeria, they all reacted with high fives and verbal approvals like ""HAIL YEAH"" or ""Nice nice nice."" This grew our hype for Pequods, and it did NOT disappoint!Note about their reservation system: It does not mean you get seated immediately. You still need to wait a bit (kind of like a FastPass system at Disneyland). Luckily, there are some cool bars around the immediate area. My wife and I ended up going to Kibbitznest across the street for a warm drink. Pequods buzzed us about 30 minutes later.The pizza is amazing! Since it takes awhile for the pizza to be ready (they were insanely packed), we ordered some chicken wings as appetizers. They were delicious. Our pizza came out about 20 minutes later, and wow. My mouth is watering just thinking about that beautiful pie. They do not mess around with toppings (we got 5, and our pizza was overflowing). The crust is cooked to perfection: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It was a glorious meal and I wish there was a Pequod's Pizzeria everywhere.Service was great, location is a bit away from downtown Chicago, and ambiance is cool. My suggestion for any first timers is to not get so many toppings on one pizza. Like I said: They do not skimp on the toppings. Two toppings would be more than enough, maybe three. But five was definitely too much and I ended up scraping off half of my toppings per slice. This is definitely a must visit for any pizza lover!",18,3,positive
321,"Being a huge fan of deep dish pizza, I was genuinely let down by the mainstream (and admittedly touristy) spots like Lou Malnati's and to a lesser extent, Giordano's. I was taken there by a friend native to Chicago against my will and I was craving something more unique afterwards. That's when I went to Pequod's Pizza. You walk inside Pequod's and you aren't greeted with the best customer service (still, the staff is pleasant) or the best atmosphere around; but you're greeted with absolutely amazing food. That's why you come here-- for the pizza. Pequod's does things a bit differently. The crust of the pizza is carmelized and has a fantastic crunch to the initial bite. The ingredients from the cheese to the meats and veggies all taste and look fresh. As with any deep-dish spot, there is the dreaded ~40 minute wait for your pizza to cook. However, Pequod's throws you a bone and offers you a free coffee, hot chocolate, or soda at the Whale Tale just steps away from the restaurant. Still, I recommend sharing a few appetizers and crisp beers to help make the wait easier.What I tried & liked:Small Deep-Dish Pizza: I topped my pizza with chicken and jalapenos and couldn't be happier. Naturally, deep-dish is extremely heavy and it's tough to get past a couple of slices (a good problem to have). But never would I imagine that the carmelized crust makes this pizza SO much better than the competition. Baking the pies in the seasoned cast-iron pans with cheese really adds a second element to the pizza missing from major chains.Things I tried & disliked:Cheesy Garlic Bread - It's your run-of-the-mill garlic bread topped with cheese. It wasn't particularly delicious and felt more like garlic bread I should receive at a dive bar. I'd recommend trying another appetizer like mozzarella sticks or onion rings-- those are difficult to get wrong.Pequod's is not in downtown-- in fact, it can be inconvenient to get here and have to head all the way back to the city. But there's a good reason why Pequod's has such a strong following, even more than that of its mainstream rivals. For what the restaurant lacks in overall polish, it more than makes up for with its unique pizza. Don't leave Chicago without trying it!",23,2,positive
322,This pizza was just ok. Crust was good but the sauce didn't taste fresh at all :(Prefer Lou Malnati's to this any day. Also the location lacks ambiance... it's very dark and there is no natural light. Would not return here.,2,1,negative
323,"The pizza is worth waiting for. We made a 'priority table' request (which you have to do at least 24 hours ahead of time) as a party of 2 on a Monday night, and waited less than 20 minutes from check in. The pizza did take a while to come- about 50 Mins from when we ordered, so it's worth ordering an app. We got the fried mushrooms- they were decent and staved off the hunger until our pepperoni, mushroom, olive and basil (the fresh basil is KEY) deep dish arrived. Great pizza, and I'd wait again for it. Taking off 1 Star because 1) we were seated right next to a garbage can- like if I bent my elbow out, it would have hit the overflowing garbage can. YUCK. I get it, it's a busy place- but if there isn't space for a table, don't stick it there. And 2) the place is pretty dirty- floors needed sweeping, the table was sticky, and the booths next to our table looks pretty grimy too. Also soda water out of the tap was $2.75- for a bottle of San Pellegrino maybe, but that was one charge that surprised me, in an otherwise fairly-priced place.",9,5,positive

326,A lot of hype for this place. We ordered pizza for pick up - it was ready as promised in 45 minutes. It does look like a nice place to dine in with two floors. For the pan pizza with pepperoni - 5 stars. It reminded me of when I ate with my family as a child at a Pizza Hut overseas. At the time it felt like a 5-Star pizza restaurant. Crispy caramelized crust delivers! For the thin crust cheese pizza we ordered - 2 stars. The topping sloughed off like it was a poorly homemade pizza with the premade crust.,6,1,positive

328,"Some serious Chicago pie! Pequod's contends with best deep dish in the city and has never disappointed. The place is always packed and you will always wait 15-45 minutes, if not at the bar then standing outside. The website even says ""Priority Seating requests can be made online, by email or phone. Priority Seating Requests are NOT GUARANTEED RESERVATIONS."" So, either visit during off hours or be prepared to wait. The two-floor restaurant has a divey feel--nothing fancy about silverware or place setting-- but the food is no joke. There's not a bad pizza on the menu, but I'm partial to the pan pepperoni. The apps are just as tasty, but you'll need to save room if you want more than 1-2 slices! I love Pequod's for its quintessential Chicago-ness: sports paraphernalia, a game on tv, and some hearty 'za.",3,2,positive
329,"Pequod's is my favorite, but it is definitely an acquired taste. If you're visiting Chicago, I'd definitely recommend trying Pequods and Lou Malnatis to get a few different styles of deep dish. Pequod's is a great neighborhood restaurant that's normally very busy, so expect to wait. It's worth it, and you won't find this style elsewhere.",4,0,positive
330,"I'm so disappointed! I use to LOVE this place. I came here a few weeks back and asked for a table for three, including my toddler. I wanted a booth and was rudely told no because I could not put a high chair on the edge of the booth, which I understood. I told the hostess that I would go without the high chair. I just wanted to sit in a booth rather a table. The tables are located in the middle of the restaurant where you get hit with everyone's coats as they pass by. She said something under here breath, walked us to our table and literally threw the menus on the table. As she walked away, she called me a b*tch in spanish, probably not knowing I spoke spanish. Usually if I'm unhappy with the service I just won't go back but I was so mad I just had to speak with the manager. When the manager came to our table, he was laughing and distracted by other employees. He seemed very young and uninterested in what I was saying to him. I don't expect great service from a pizza joint but the plain disrespect is uncalled for. I love the pizza here but I will never return and I'll make sure to spread the word.",2,3,negative

Pardon?! and then ""accidentally"" disconnected call . When I called back I explained to call taker we were just trying to gage if maybe best if we should pick up rather than waiting over an hour?!  And I explained I wanted to speak to the manager Bc of the lack of customer service and how abrupt/rude Ms. Katie is.

333,"Originally when I heard about this place, it felt like people were pulling my leg.   ""Pequods"" sounded like someone was luring you into a dark alley of a bad joke.  I've had my fair share of deep dish experiences around Chicago, but this one is definitely my favorite.  Maybe because it's not as ""commercialized"" as some of the cough, cough.... other competitors, but it has a great local, lived-in feel.The other thing I liked about it is that it was a little difficult to get to.... why is this a point I like to share?  It just feels like a little ""off the beaten path"" so that it's really not intended to be a tourist trap.  It is a good 15-18min walk from the Belmont (Red/Brown/Purple Lines) CTA stop, but there is also street parking available.  I suggest the walk... since it will prepare you for the carb-loading heaving you are about to experience when you come here.We arrived early.... party of 4 with a high-chair and we got seated right away (even though there was just 2 of us of the party present).  I like that it's first-come-first-serve so that people that eat early to avoid crowds are rewarded and there's no really extensive reservation process.  We were escorted past a bar (all seats filled) of people enjoying food and beverages and a bunch of high-top tables.  We were lucky enough to get a booth and the high-chair fit perfectly on the end of the table.  You can tell the server was busy with a party of 12/mix of kids and adults that basically ""sheilded us"" off from the other part of the restaurant since they extended the booth table with long tables to accommodate the large party, but our server kept checking on us.  We put in an appetizer that arrived as the rest of our party did and we placed our pizza order right away.  Half topping large between 4 people after a sample platter of appetizers was just enough food. My only complaint is that the server that brought the pizza served us the slices so the photo op for the pizza was gone is a second.  I did what I could though.  We passed the time with beer and good company and just taking the atmosphere in.  By the time we left, the entire restaurant was full as were our stomachs.  I'd be interested to come back and try their thin crust... which a lot of tables were enjoying around us.",20,5,positive

338,"Oh Chicago pizza, I have heard so much about you. When an entire city is known for pizza, not just one restaurant, which one am I supposed to choose?! It's a tough decision possibly made easier by the fact that you can't go wrong.Pequod's was not what I expected at all. It was like a pub/bar feel, with small tables all over the place and just a couple of booths on the side. The menu is pretty much just pizza and a few other selections like pasta and salad. Their pizzas come in thin crust or pan pizza, and come in 10"", 12"", 16""(14"" for pan). The pan pizza also offers a personal 7"" size. Each topping is 50 cents and you can add as many as you want.The two of us ordered a small (10"") pan pizza to share and it was about the right size. We probably could have done a medium, but we would be really stuffed. Never having this deep dish of a pizza before, I wasn't expecting to be so full, but there's just so much crust and cheese that it fills you up pretty quickly.Now apparently this isn't really the deepest of deep dish, but it's still pretty deep compared to other pizzas. The crust is so crispy in the bottom and the sides of the crust have this layer of burnt cheese all the way up the sides that is just so good. The sauce and cheese are in just the right amounts to not be too saucy/cheesy, and the sausage that we got as a topping was amazing -- perfectly cooked and spiced and great with the sauce and cheese.I don't eat pizza much in general, but was really excited to try some Chicago pizza on my trip. Pequod's did not disappoint at all, and only makes me want to find some good deep dish back at home. The service is as fast as it can be (it takes close to 45 minutes ro make a pizza), and the atmosphere is fun and lively, with TV's and drinks to go around. Whether you're out of state like me or a Chicago native, definitely stop by this place and see what the hype is about!!",19,2,positive
339,"I've had mostly good experiences here. They're not located downtown, so they get lost in the Chicago saturation of Giordano's and Lou's and aren't famous with or necessarily sought out by tourists, which is honestly great. That being said, they are still busy AF, but there's definitely a sweet spot in terms of arrival time. I've brought Brits, Icelanders, and Russians here and all of them had their minds blown. The Russian tried to order a salad, but we threatened him with harm and he came around. Anyways, the food. The pizza is amazing. I'm not sure from where they source their sauce, but it's deliciously tomato-ey with the perfect amount of acidity and seasoning that stands out we'll all against the rafts of cheese and toppings. The crust is what everyone talks about though, so on to that. It's more pillowy than Giordano's, which is good in its own right. G's is a crisper, more buttery crust and is LOADED with toppings. P's definitely privileges the crust experience as they sprinkle it with cheese on the outside which forms a crunchy, crusty exterior. The crust-to-toppings-and-sauce at P's definitely favors the much thicker crust, so if you're into bread this is your pizza. I had a slightly negative experience when I had family come visit recently, but it was largely rectified. We had two small children with us, so I called them, understanding their reservation policy is really just sort of a 1/2 line-skipper policy and asked when to come in. We were told 5:00 was good so we did that. We showed up on time and proceeded to wait our 30 minutes we were told about. Came and went, waited 10 additional minutes. Went and talked to hostess and she said they were getting our table ready. 10 more minutes went by (50 minutes total for us public school kids) and I'm nine months pregnant with two insane 3 year olds so I saunter up there looking fat and hungry and am told just a few more minutes. I tell my family I'm pretty pissed since we came when we were told to come and we're still waiting at an hour; they still want to wait it out. I speak to a manager. Apparently the long wait was because the hostess seated another party that just waltzed in unannounced at our table and there wasn't another one available for a bit but he would ""take care"" of us. We were eventually seated around the 1.25 hour mark. The manager took our order while we were waiting and our pizza showed up shortly after we sat down. We got comped a pitcher of 3 Floyds, which was really nice, so all in all it evened out in the end in terms of pizza arrival time vs. wait time! They definitely screwed up, but owned up to it and fixed it as best as they could. Good job Pequods.",15,5,positive

342,"This is our first trip to Chicago so deep-dish pizza is obviously a must-try. We found this place by doing a quick Google search of ""best pizza in Chicago"" then clicking one of the first search results.Allow me to preface the rest of the review by acknowledging that we came on a Saturday night, presumably the busiest night for this restaurant (or any restaurant, to be honest). Maybe some of the things we saw are not the norm. But I'm still going to rate based on our experience.Before going we requested priority seating on their website but I'm not sure it actually made a difference. When we arrived the estimated waiting time was an hour but when we gave our priority seating request the hostess said the wait would be 20-30 minutes, which is what the website said. Cut to ~50 minutes later & we're finally going inside. Everyone before us (about 20-25 people) has already gone inside as well, defeating the purpose of a priority seating request. While the website does say that a request for priority seating is not a reservation, the fact that the hostess told us ""20-30 minutes"" was a little annoying.Once we finally get upstairs we're placed at a small table near the stairwell. Great seating, not a problem. The only issue is that when I sit down I scrape my fingernail on the table (as occasionally happens with long nails) & felt something come up. I looked down and yep, that's food residue. Wonderful. Looking around at the floor reveals much of the same. There's food on the ground & a lot of it. By this point we're starving & as long as the plates come out clean, no one is really going to complain much. And they did come out clean. After being told the pizza wouldn't be ready for another hour we ordered cheesy garlic bread. Really good, especially with the pizza sauce that came out with it. As for the actual pizza, I got the small pepperoni pan with extra cheese & fresh garlic. Look, I'm already an ""eat everything with a knife and fork"" kind of girl, but this pizza really called for a knife and a fork. And a bib. It was so good I was a tiny bit afraid I would pass out in it. They also make their sauces in house which is really cool. I had the ranch which was delicious, as was the pizza sauce that came with the cheesy garlic bread. I got two little containers to go -- one for the rest of the pizza & one for whatever else I needed to put ranch on. Honestly the food was so good I didn't mind the wait.I gave this place 3 stars for the amazing food & took off two for the sheer amount of food that was everywhere. It is possible that we were seated in a particularly bad spot but a couple that came in about an hour after us were seated then 5 minutes later got out of their booth for a waitress to sweep under their table. There was just too much food where there shouldn't have been. Next time we'll swing by on a week night.",14,5,negative

My favorite pizzas are Round Table in Redding, CA, Regina's in North End Boston and Juliana's in Brooklyn. But now ""PeePots"" is my new number 1. PERFECT crust with lacy edges, AMAZING sauce they should jar and sell, DELICIOUS stringy chewy cheese to hold it all together, spicy thin pepperoni with burnt edges....my mouth is watering and I just ate it 8 hours ago.

The waiters make sure you're not left alone for a long time.

A few times we nicely asked the front counter what was our wait time that remained and why there were so many open seats in the restaurant. We were met with impatience towards our comments and rude remarks back. He explained people can reserve a table and they must hold it for up to two hours... Very inefficient operations if this is true!We were seated upstairs, (to our surprise this area existed) where there was more empty seats. However, our waitress was extremely nice! She fully sympathized with us and was prompt in taking our order and making sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. We had onion rings to hold us over (they were alright) and got a plain deep dish pizza. The pizza itself was very good! The crust was perfectly crunchy and the sauce was sweet and delicious. Pequod's does have great deep dish, but their restaurant operations and parts of their customer service/interactions need to be improved.",10,3,negative
357,I come from New York and new haven pizza so I was excited to experience the deep dish life. I swear this was a notch down from school cafeteria pizza. The sauce tasted like ketchup. The crust was just doughy and had zero flavor. It felt like a pizza you make using Pillsbury crust and the lowest grade cheese. Super disappointed,3,1,negative
358,"It had been so many years since I was at this location and, wow, what a change in crowd! I mean, still a young crowd but we got older, but it was never nearly as packed back in the day as it was this week. What a crowd! We called ahead and got priority on the seating list and that made a big difference, but we were fortunate enough to immediately get two seats at the bar and get served quickly and place our order quickly with a great bartender.Our salad and appetizer came super quickly which made the wait for our ever delicious Pequod's Pizza a little easier. I didn't want an iceberg and romaine mix and the bartender was happy to have spinach swapped out for my side salad order. Very accommodating.Our classic, deep dish Pequod's pie came within about 30 to 45 minutes, piping hot. Delicious as always! Caramelized rim of the crust and top as always!I'm so used to going to the Morton Grove location, which I love, yet I was not disappointed in coming to the Clybourn location!",12,1,positive
359,"We really enjoyed Pequod's - I think it's the best deep dish that I've had in Chicago.Of course they have the ridiculous caramelized crust.... which is one of the main attractions. The sauce is very fresh and great, a touch too sweet - cheese is perfect. The start of the show -  the toppings are on point - pepperoni, onion and giardiniera is the way to go. I'm salivating  all over the keyboard. Great beer selection at a reasonable price.",7,1,positive
360,"Pequods...be still my heart. Your deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza is what pizza dreams are made of. Your crust perfectly crunchy on the bottom yet soft and so light. Your sauce deliciously zesty and full of flavor. Your cheese nicely crisped on the edges and melted perfectly on top. And your sausage and pepperoni (and I typically don't like pepperoni)...goodness it's all too tasty. I've had the other Chicago deep dishes and they've got nothing on you. Not their crusts, not their sauces, and not their toppings. I shall dream of you til we meet again.",7,0,positive
361,"If you can make it over here, GET YOUR DEEP DISH HERE!I've been here twice now, and I have really enjoyed it each time.The atmosphere is relaxed, and very sports-bar-like, with TVs dotted around space. They have a second floor with more seating, but as a whole, the place does not have the most seating. I've heard of people have to wait for hours on weekends.I've only been here on weekdays for dinner, and I have never had to wait.I've come with a larger group, and we do call ahead.As for food, two large pizzas is perfect for eight people. And don't forget to add a couple beers! Alogether, two large pizzas and two pitchers of beer ended up being 16.44. Great value for money!And honestly, best deep dish. The cheese to crust to topping ratio is very even. The crust is cook slightly over so that it is cheesy and crisp on the outside. So. GOOD!And the waiters have always been very helpful in helping us decide what to order, and are very attentive to our drinks situation.If you are going to get deep dish, come here!",8,1,positive
362,"Pizza was amazing!! highly recommend!!  appetizers were just average. we got there and they told us we would have to wait an hour and a half for a table, only waited 50 minutes, but it was strange when we went to the hostess initially, she told us to come back in 45 minutes for a pager since they had run out. get more pagers maybe??? i'm sure this is not the first time that happened. i feel like if i wouldn't have gone up to get the pager sooner we would've missed out on our table if we weren't standing inside waiting, while most people did stand out in the cold. they took 3 groups of us upstairs & seated a couple that came AFTER us, before us, incredibly annoying. our waitress was just ok, she a different tables appetizers down on our table then once she realized she picked them up and placed them on their table and it took her 25 minutes after our pizza came to come to us and ask if everything was okay. i would carry out instead of dine in, next time.",4,3,positive

366,"I was suggested by many for a true Chicagoan pizza experience and was not disappointed. I suggest going on a week day, I went on a week day morning and a wait time was nonexistent, however you will wait 30-40 min for your pizza regardless because it takes time for the dough to finish cooking. Onwards to the pizza! The sauce was evenly spread, plentiful, and danced with the spices and herbs while the cheese melted in the gooey, savory masterpiece harmonizing with the scrumptious toppings instead of simply laying on top. I was impressed, and although I am not a fan of the deep dish, I know pizza lovers will continue to flock and fraternize. I highly recommend the garlic bread, I can't begin to describe how heavenly it was.",7,1,positive
367,"I have NEVER in my life had such terrible service... I called at 6:30 to order food. I was told 1 hour 15 minutes for wait time. Not bad for a Saturday night?? I arrive at 7:45 to pickup my pizza and they tell me it's almost ready. LOL I just got my pizza at 9:10pm. They make you pay as soon as you arrive and then they never give you time updates. When they handed me my pizza, I let her know my wings were missing.. she told me sorry you didn't pay for wings. So I asked her to print my receipt and guess what was on there? WINGS.  She threw my receipt at me and 15 minutes later brought out the rest of my food. I'm sure the food is great, haven't had a chance to eat it but the staff and and organization is so terrible that I will never eat there again. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! Worst experience yet in Chicago.",2,4,negative

Can you guess who got sat first???Update: Took 40 minutes to be sat with ""priority seating."" Pitcher of beer we were given was not what we asked for. Had to ask several times to get get plates for the group we had. Had to ask several times to get forks for the table. Asked for half pepperoni half cheese and was given whole cheese. But they said a medium cheese pizza was being made to fix the mistake, which took an additional 25 minutes to get to us. I've never been so disappointed with a restaurant before. Failure on all accounts; host, server, bartender, cooks, they literally all failed on our table. I'm sad about it cuz I love the pizza but the service was so bad I may not return.",1,5,negative
369,This place is hands down the best deep dish pizza in the city in my opinion.  Who doesn't love a cripsy cheese crust?It gets really busy on game nights.  If you go on a Friday make sure you go early.  The best time to visit without a wait is to come during the weekday or during the day on a Saturday or Sunday.,3,0,positive
370,Oh my gosh Thick and good I'm outside of Atlanta currently living Therefore challenged in the quality pizza areaThe large will keep 2 ppl fed for 2 days.Loud and exciting Great locationGlad we walked 2 miles home after consuming Had to wait an hour for the pizza yet worth it.,3,0,positive
371,Must try deep dish pizza! The dough is super soft with a caramelized crust. I haven't been to many places but it was well worth the wait. The appetizer combos and wings were just as good. We got two mediums which was more than enough for 6 people.,6,0,positive
372,"Pretty terrible all around. There are so many great deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago, it's a waste of money and time to eat here. Dirty restaurant,  duck taped booths, dirty tables. Nothing charming about this place. The TVs all had news with rape and murder broadcasting across the screens so we had to ask our 10 year old to not look at all the glaring TVs. Waitress was slightly nice, but sick with a cold. Salad was brown and wilty with terrible ranch. Worst fried zucchini I've ever tasted. Terrible beer and wine list. Pizza is way too bready with the old Italian seasoning thrown in. Not enough cheese and sauce like traditional Chicago deep dish. Out of the way location. Please don't waste your money here.",5,9,negative
373,"Our family has gone to and ordered from Pequod's for years and years and years, long before the popularity has surfaced. I don't understand the attraction?  The pizza is good, the salads are eh, and the service is totally unpredictable.  Perhaps their growth in girth, fan appeal and space has created inconsistency in order accuracy, quality, and staffing.   There are better these days, in my opinion and NOT worth the long lines.",5,2,negative
374,"Pequod's is the best deep dish there is in Chicago. I can't count the number of high fives I got when I mentioned it as my favorite deep dish to foodie insiders. I took my boyfriend there this past weekend, he never had the sweet goodness of Chicago deep dish. The look of sheer joy and satisfaction on his face after taking a few bites said it all. The atmosphere was quiet on a Monday afternoon. The service was attentive, our server kept refilling our beverages and would check on us every so often. We were also impressed when she suggested we saved the ranch from our wings to dip our pizza, that is the type of thinking we appreciate. We had deep dish pizza with pepperoni and fresh garlic, we ordered buffalo wings before the pizza, there was a 20 minute wait for pizza, and we were starving. Be prepared on busier days the wait is longer 40 minutes or so. The pizza is phenomenal, the crust is crispy and buttery, the cheese, sauce and dough form a gooey paradise in your mouth. We left beyond full and headed to the airport and did not regret one bit of it.",12,1,positive
375,"Visiting from California.Nothing about this place was good. The pizza was the worst pizza I've ever had and that's saying a lot especially since this place was supposed to be Chicago's best pizzeria. I ordered a certain style of pizza, I received the completely opposite. I don't eat meat and the pizza came loaded with pepperoni, I guess for some that a good problem, yet for me it wasn't. The flavor was bland, the sauce didn't have enough spices and the cheese wasn't melted enough. I wouldn't eat here again, nor recommend anyone coming from out of town to eat here if they want good pizza.",7,2,negative
376,"The pizza was great, but the wait time was not. As to be expected with deep dish, the pizza took about 45 minutes. But when you take into account the amount of time it takes to be seated, etc. plan for at least an hour and a half before you will eat. Don't go starving. Also, do not go with a large group. We went with a group of 9 and were squeezed into a table that should fit 5-6. All in all, the food was wonderful, but the location is tiny.",2,0,positive
377,One of the best pizza places to eat in chicago. The crust is a good amount of crispy and tastes really good (even though it looks burnt its not). It is a long wait to eat there but its definitely worth the wait!!,4,0,positive

379,"Got here at 8pm on Wednesday night and there wasn't a wait. We ordered some fries and the single for 2 and it was more than enough of food. Be aware that it does take 30-40 minutes for the pizza to come. I was really hungry, so the fries were perfect to hold me over.Pizza- it was pretty good, as we ordered pepperoni and sausage for our toppings. It's greasier and messier than Lou malnatis, and they burnt the edges of the crust for a crispier flavor (not sure if that was intentional or not). We split the small 10"" between 2 people and it's more than enough food. Don't order more than that or you're going to end up with a ton of leftoversService was good and it has more of a local atmosphere (compared to Lou's where it just felt like a touristy restaurant). Liked the bar ambiance and being able to watch the bulls and cubs games. Great value. Paid less than $20 for the whole dinner. Overall, the food is excellent, but it's not going to blow your mind. I see the appeal of Pequod's being a local favorite.",10,2,positive
380,"TL,DR - LONG wait line 1-2Hrs  (and 45 mins after ordering) Therese a reason why Chicago raves about pequad's they definitely know their pizza. I suggest a Pan Pizza and an appetizer while you wait. im not a Chicago native but will return here again, and gladly wait in line to grab a pizza. This place changed my thoughts on deep dish.I was on the fence about deep dish pizza as it always seemed like it would be a heavy meal, and it is. Its only good depending on who makes it.My gf decided i needed to try Pequod's while visiting Chicago. Gotta say, this place def changed my mind about deep dish. Wait time- Excessively long during nights, you may be looking upwards of 1-2 hour wait and another 45 mins before you get your food after placing the order. Interior - There is a downstairs area and a second floor as well. Downstairs seems a bit more crowded but has a larger bar. There is more room for tables and larger parties upstairs with a smaller bar. Just depends on preference. The place feels welcoming with a good down to earth and sports bar vibe.. dimly lit and plenty of screens to watch the game.We ended up getting a smaller pizza as there was 2 of us, this was recommended  by the waitress. We also ordered cheese bread which was to die for (or i think i was just starving) if youre impatient i suggest getting an appetizer. 1 Pan pizza - 3 toppings (Jalapeno, Pepperoni & Mushrooms) Ive seen deepdish before and what always turned me away was how greasy and runny the pizza would be. Pequad's was not the case! their pizza crust was crispy and held up quite nicely my fav by far. The sauce and toppings were not greasy or oily at all. I finished half the pizza (2 slices) before tapping out.",8,5,positive
381,"Excellent food!  We went for lunch and were excited to see the lunch special, 7in pan pizza for $4.95.  We started with the bruschetta which by presentation didn't look appealing, but the toast was garlic and buttery and the tomato relish was spot on.  Not a traditional brushchetta, but I would definitely order again.  I had the 7in pan cheese pizza and it was fantastic!  The sauce, crust and cheese were flavorful and unique.  My friend had the beef sandwich which she said was delicious.  Service was great and environment chill.  We will be back",6,1,positive

We ordered 2 medium size deep dish pizzas and few salads for a group of 6 people and it was just right!",4,0,positive
383,"I really liked this pizza. Pepperoni, sausage, sauce and crust were all delicious. The cheese that melts and burns on the edge of the pan and pizza is heaven.

384,"deeee-lish deep dish! Pequod's was my welcome food to Chicago, and after having tried two others after, this is still on the top of my list. My cousins recommended this place, and it's easy to see why they rave over the deep dish pizza here- served in a cast iron skillet, with a burnt edge crust (just the top, really), they get the pizza right. Down to the sauce, the amount of cheese, and toppings- I'm drooling just writing about this! We were able to choose a half and half option, which was awesome! We went with spinach, mushrooms, and sausage for one half and pepperoni, garlic, and basil with the other half. Coupled with a pitcher of beer, this was the perfect afternoon! The pizza was finished, and now I'm wishing I was back in Chicago for more. Definitely would return!",8,0,positive

At first glance... mouth was watering... but it wasn't until that first bite, that I had that Disney Ratatouille moment. Every single flavor separate from the others, yet satisfyingly delicious. I'm glad I was able to make it here.",6,0,positive

Ridiculous and unacceptable. Open larger tables but reused to seat do to holding it for larger parties. The pizza here is typically great but their seating policies are crap. Won't let you order a pie while you're waiting for a table to expedite and be efficient. Completely upside down and backwards I came across the city and will not return. Not worth the parking headache, traffic, or senseless host. If there is a 30 minute wait and a 40 minute sign for pie, why not allow ordering? It'd turn your table faster. Crappy customer service, poor business efficiencies, good pie if you want to accept their BS seating.",5,5,negative
387,"Pequod's is now the 5th Chicago deep dish pizza joint I've tried in the past year. Though I'm by no means a die-hard deep dish fan, I still rather liked Pequod's and think it's my 2nd favorite deep dish (to find out which one is my fav, check out my other reviews ;))So what's good?- the SAUCE. I think it's one of my favs- generous toppings. when they give sausage, they give LOTS of sausage.- the giardiniera topping - YUMNow for the bad..- the thick crust. I get that there must be thick crust so all the toppings, cheese, and sauce are held together... but I just thought there was too much dough- I came a weds for lunch, so there was no wait (aside from the 45 mins for the pizza), but I imagine weekends to be a different story- it's not very cheap. it turned out to be $20/pp including drinks + tip + tax",5,2,positive
388,"I am writing this review more in terms of customer service rather than that of the quality of the food. We are frequent patrons of Pequod's Pizzeria and are apart of the community; however, I was unaware that this was not a family friendly place. We went to Pequod's at 6pm and were fine with the more than hour to hour and a half wait; however, once the time had expired we were met with an unfriendly host who had an attitude and prompted a very negative interaction and left a very negative view of the customer service we receive at Pequod's. As much as we love this pizza I do not feel we'll ever feel comfortable at this establishment.",4,2,negative
389,I am more than willing to wait two hours for pizza but was extremely disappointed by what I was served. The crust was somehow rock hard yet when you finally chisel a piece away it tasted like undercooked corn meal. I am shocked this place made so many best of chicago lists.,3,3,negative
390,"I've been to a couple of different joints for deep dish and never quite cared enough but this though is a different league. The sauce was amazing though a little too wet to make eating not too messy. The cheesy garlic bread was great too. The crust was part cheese, adding to the flavour. Service? It was great. Our server checked in with my friend about the definitely drunk group next to us just to make sure everything was a-ok. It's rare that restaurants care if your neighbours are nice or not.My only unhappiness is that I've to wait to order my pizza. Guess I've been spoilt by how Lou Malnati let's you order them while waiting for a table.",5,3,positive

The wait is definitely worth it and the pizza tastes just as amazing the next day for left overs :) !!",7,1,positive
396,Dine in only. Take out or delivery is awful. This place is typical bar and pizza. However the pizza is the best deep dish there is. A true Chicago classic that you need to check out.

However, I did want to do some research so I could at least try what many consider to be the best. Yes, there are other places that are considered to be the go to.But when I spoke with the Chicago locals, this place is the only place to go to for deep dish. I unfortunately can not speak too much for the place itself as far as ambience, atmosphere, service etc as I got an order to go. However, it did seem like a cozy joint to have some good pizza and have a good time. I ordered my deep dish over the phone and put like a million toppings so it came out to be about 30 bucks or so, but it was totally worth it. Even a day later, the leftovers were delicious.

I love that they are always clear and right on with their wait and pizza cooking times so that there is no confusion. It's definitely worth the wait. I recommend pepperoni and sausage in my pizza!",10,1,positive
401,"Decided to check this place out because of the reviews and fact that it was open late. We got the wings and cheesy bread for appetizers. The cheesy bread was a sub/hoagie roll with a bunch of cheese melted on top of it. It was okay. Nothing spectacular. Surprisingly they charge for the marina sauce that ""comes with it""... weird. The wings came in two flavors. BBQ or buffalo. We went with BBQ and again was charged for the ranch dressing that ""comes with it"". When the deep dish pizza came out, so did my inner greedy person because my eyes got big and I got excited by the look of it. The waitress cut it and placed it on plates for us. I grabbed my fork and knife to grab a forkful of it and as soon as it hit my mouth, I felt betrayed. The flavor was good however, the crust took up half of the depth of the pie. I was definitely disappointed by that. The atmosphere of the place was good. It has a cool, laid back feel with pretty good music. Overall, it was okay but if you're looking for a deep dish pizza loaded with toppings and less crust, this isn't the place for you.",8,5,negative
402,"If I could eat only one dish before I died, you can bet that one dish would be pizza. With that said, I was a little disappointed with Pequod's pie. While visiting the great city of Chicago I knew I had to taste a legit Chicago Deep Dish. As I eagerly waited with the utmost excitement, my joy would soon turn into sorrow. As soon as our pie hit the table I could not wait to sink my teeth into my very first Chicago Deep Dish! However, as I carefully chewed on this Chigaco classic, I could not help but think, ""hmm... this pizza literally tastes like a Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut."" I get it... I understand the ""nostalgic-ness"" of Pequod's, and for that I completely respect it. In fact my 3-Star rating has nothing to do with the fact that our server was horrible. And I understand the excitement that patrons have for their trademark crust... but, to me, it did not live up to the hype.Overall, the pizza and experience was good not Great. Would I eat there again if I could? Most likely not. Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely. All in all, I think that great food should leave you speechless, and with a sense of knowing that, ""you'll never find a dish this f*#king good... not nowhere!""

403,"As a tourist from California, I came to Chicago to venture out deep dish pizza joints. After further research, I have concluded four original deep dish pizza from Chicago; Lou Manati, Uno, Pequods and Giordanos. See my other reviews of the other three and their respective ranking of the four godfathers of ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza"". I will not grade on the service due to the fact that they were take outs + eaten within 20 minutes. Here is my take on Pequod;At $28, they were just a bit more pricey for aSmall size deep dish. Pizza: custom, all meat pizza The crust: solid, burnt but still had flavorSauce: Just about right Meat: all the meat literally was filling. The roast beef meat was the best! They did not cheap out Cheese: melted, okayAtmosphere: great for ages 20-35 crowd, nice ambience Parking: located further away from downtown, but yet close enough. Overall: I would have to rank Pequod second out of the four godfathers of ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza"" places. Pros: the area is great, parking shouldn't be an issue. LOTS OF MEAT!Cons: could be more cheesy and less burnt crusts. Also if they could have a normal menu rather than a custom menuGrade: B",7,2,positive

405,Got here on a Sunday night and the wait was about an hour. I've waited longer for food so I'm not that mad. Got seated up stairs and placed our order right away. Got cheese sticks for apps which were really good. Order a medium pan pizza with sausage and green peppers. I can tell they use fresh ingredients cause the green peppers tasted fresh. But here come the bad. The pizza had no flavor to me. It was just blend. Some bits I had were good but overall just blah! The ratio is completely off. There is just too much bread. Is that what a pan pizza is like? If so I'll pass on all pan pizza. Overall the place is cool but I truly can not understand what people see in this pizza. It's actually terrible. And don't get me started with the left overs: it's even worst when you reheat it up. Oh the sausage was great though but I wish there was more.,8,4,negative

Eventually picked this place because my friends highly recommended this. I went there for lunch by myself. The lunch deal was really cheap (~$7 for 7""pan cheese pizza with two toppings and a drink). I had high expectations before I came here but the quality was just so-so. It reminded me of Pizza Hut pizza with a thicker crust. Was disappointed.

Our server switched mid sitting, which was weird, so our second server never came to fill up our water until we asked. Overall a very mediocre experience and not a place I will come back to.",1,4,negative
410,Made a reservation because there seems to always be a long wait. We arrived and still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. My friend and I shared a small DD. It took about 50 minutes to arrive at the table. The pizza was good; heavy on the sauce and the cheese are was bit spread out. Enjoyed the copious amounts of toppings! Service was friendly. I give it 4 stars because we were seated right next to a garbage can which was kind of gross.,3,2,positive
411,"Pequods uses low quality ingredients. Not convinced? Order a thin crust pizza and see how greasy it is.Their gimmick is the carmelized crust, which after you have once you realize is gummy and just not good. Look, those that know pizza, know that Pequods is one thing - and that's all HYPE. One final comment - I have never seen a filthier establishment. Garbage is everywhere.",1,2,negative
412,"The wait was worth it!   (It was only about 15 mins on a Friday afternoon around 2:00 pm)  It's wheelchair accessible, if you let them know and the pizza is good!  I got a personal pan with a couple toppings and it was good!  It's does have a thick crust but you don't really even notice.  It has a great balance of crust, sauce and cheese.  Very good!",6,0,positive
413,"As a New Yorker. I take pride in my hometown pizza. I'm no brat about it, but at the same time. Deep dish pizza is not pizza. As one friend put it, it's bread lasagna.However, I do like my deep dish pizza. So on my first visit to the windy city, I was told this was the best place for deep dish.My friend and I split a small, half regular, half sausage & onion. Boy howdy does this stuff fill you up! Every bite makes you want to take another one. Pequods is certainly the king of deep dish pizza in Chicago!If you ever pass thru this city, I'd absolutely check it out. You won't be disappointed",3,3,positive
414,"Came here saturday night around 6 PM and this place was paaaacked. Wait to dine in was an hour and then another 1.5 hour for your pizza to be made. We made an executive decision to carry out so we could eat faster heheWe ordered a small with mushrooms and then went across the street to Kibbitznest (which you should totally do if you have a long wait because that place is awesome).It took a little longer than what they quoted us so when we went back they surprised us with a large pizza woooooop Took it home and devoured it. Personally i'm a thin crust fan (east coast represent) so I'm generally suspicious of deep dish. But I was surprised they actually had a decent amount of sauce unlike other deep dish I've had. Mushrooms were really good and the cheese crust was phenomenal. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was how dry the bread is. But all in all, would come back for this lunch special I hear so much about.",5,1,positive
415,Okay so this isn't my personal favorite place for deep dish but I do find myself coming here often bc it's where my husband likes to bring our out of town guests for deep dish. The crust here is more caramelized which I like but I don't consider this fully deep dish. It's really good though so I'd recommend!,5,0,positive

417,I brought 2 of my friends to Pequod's on a Saturday around 2pm after my fiancé told me that they serve some of the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. It was super packed but the hostess was very efficient. We ended up waiting for about 10 minutes at the bar until our table was ready. We ordered a deep dish pizza (idr what size or type lol it's been a month) but I do know that it was pretty delicious. Our waitress was really nice and the place felt like a 70s pizza parlor lol. I like it a lot and will be back one day when I feel like waiting for great deep dish.,11,0,positive
418,"This was the best pizza place I've been to in Chicago. We went on Mother's Day around noon and was able to sit without waiting! I heard the lines get insanely long so we were super lucky. We ordered a small and medium for 4 people and it was more than enough. We had leftovers. For the pan pizzas, we ordered sausage, meatballs, and jalapeños for one and onion, pepperoni, mushroom, and onions for the other. Both were sooo good. Will miss this place!",5,1,positive
419,Was in Chicago recently and of course had to get deep dish pizza.  I had read a lot of articles about Pequod's being the best and were they right! I was scared we woukd have to wait a long time as it was. Thursday night but we got seated after 15 mins.My boyfriend and I ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza and boy was it delicious.  The crust is caramelized and has a little bit of a crunch too it.  Full of flavor and they don't skimp out on the toppings.  I was full after just once slice but it was too food so ate another.Would recommend over Giordanos and Lou Malnatis. It is the best deep dish I've ever had!,5,1,positive
420,"Pequod's is a Bar that serves Pizza. Plain and simple. It is a very specific kind of Chicago pizza (you won't have to search very hard for the pictures) that incorporates a very airy dough, tall (deep-dish) execution, crispy-crunchy edges, and not a whole lot of cheese on top. As far as the setting, Pequod's looks and feels like a dive bar. Fortunately for Pequod, it is a good dive bar and it does what it does very well. I got what I came for, and didn't really expect anything different. It is a solid place if you want to go throw a few back and eat some pizza with friends. Honest (and very likely unpopular to many) opinion? The pizza isn't anything to write home about. It's good enough, but you have to really want this kind of pizza, else you'll be disappointed. The bartenders and servers I encountered were friendly, helpful, and swift. Service was great and I had a great time. If I were in Chicago again I'd probably try someone else's take on the indigenous pizza, but Pequod's is a good choice for those seeking the experience.",13,3,negative
421,"Hands down the best pizza I have ever had, and I have had tons of pizza. I looked forward to coming here after seeing the restaurant featured on countless tv shows. The caramelized cheese crust is to die for. I could eat just the crust and be satisfied. The pie as a whole has a great balance of crust, cheese and toppings. The sauce is delicious and I love that they are open late. There was no wait when I visited around 11pm.",5,1,positive

This is a must if in the area!!!",5,2,positive
424,After seeing all the rave I had to try. Sat at the bar upstairs...no fancy by any means but I'm there for pizza.Staff was crazy busy yet friendly.  My pan pizza was delicious.  The crust is not doughy or overly thick.  The burnt cheese edges are heaven. The days could be thicker for me but I ate it all and would go it again,4,2,positive
425,"Since this place is right by the theatre we went there to grab food before our movie. The food was amazing!! I'm definitely not a deep dish person, like I eat it but it's not something I love or crave. But after I had their cheese deep dish pizza I fell in love I've literally been thinking about going back since then. This is now my favorite deep dish place. The service was also really good. The only suggestion would be to keep the place a bit more cleaner? Saw some random paper pieces on the floor.",8,1,positive
426,"I totally understand why so many reviews and why so many great reviews.  The Chicago Deep Dish Pizza here is amazing.  They put a ton, and I do mean a TON of high quality toppings on this pizza.  The sausage chunks were like miniature boulders.  I love when a restaurant endeavors to do nothing but the best and at a great consumer value.  This will be a repeat destination on my journeys to Chicago.",6,0,positive
427,Amazing stuffed crust pizza. I was told this is where the locals eat. Place is small but they have a hard working and friendly staff. Had pan pizza sausage and mushroom. Would definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago.,1,1,positive
428,"This pizza is fantastic! We were seated very quickly given the size of the room in the place. Seating downstairs is a little cramped. My one complain was how hot it was in the room. This was my only time here so it could have been a night where the AC was malfunctioning. When ordering a pizza, they let you know in advance to expect at least a 30 minutes wait time!",2,2,positive
429,"I don't care how good your pizza is... if you're rude to first time customers and make them feel unwelcome, you get one star.  We were fully prepared to wait, but being told it would be 45 min to get a buzzer and then 3 hours after getting a buzzer is insane.  That isn't even accurate, it is simply an attempt to drive business away. Shame on you for having such an elitist practice.",2,3,negative
430,"Pequod's is consistently my favorite pizza in Chicago. Their pan pizza, while not typical ""Chicago-style,"" is sheer perfection. The sauce is tangy and delicious however the real show stopper is the cheesy crust. Pequod's lives up to the hype.",4,2,positive
431,"I was born and raised in Chicago and pride myself on knowing good pizza. I want to give this place 5 stars but I have had better so it wouldn't be fair. We had the pan pizza and our fav part is definitely the caramelized cheese edges, although one side was more burnt than caramelized. The bottom part of the crust was nice and crispy but the middle was on the doughy side. The sauce and sausage is a good flavor. We opted for green peppers as well. The size of the peppers were very random. A couple of huge pieces mixed with some smaller diced pieces. A more uniformed piece would add a consistent flavor and texture. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. It's a small place with exposed brick. Definitely busy and a little on the crammed side so it's loud. I would definitely recommend this place. I really want to give this place 5 stars. Perhaps our next visit will yield a more evenly cooked pizza.",13,0,positive
432,Among the best.  You must like dough to enjoy the pizza because it is thick and crispy at the same time.  Not too much cheese which lightens it a bit.,3,0,positive
433,"The wait for this place was craaazzzyyyy. But not crazy enough for me not to give it 5 Stars. This was on our list of places to visit during our weekend in Chicago, and it did not disappoint. Medium pizza is more than enough for two people, and it was definitely all it was hyped up to be. You get to pick your own toppings either full or half, which is convenient when sharing. Staff was friendly and attentive. I would recommend everyone to go here at least once.",6,2,positive
434,"People seem to really love Pequod's but personally I think it's a bit overrated.  I would rather go to Art of Pizza.  The lines at Pequod's can be a bit out of control and the pizzas aren't that great.  I think the reason I don't like their pizza has something to do with their crust but I can't quite identify what ingredient in it I don't like.  Also, the space is really dated and small.",4,0,negative
435,"While visiting Chicago, I knew we had to have some deep dish pizza.  It came down to choosing between Pequod's and Lou Malnati's.  After reviewing both places, I chose Pequod's because of it's unique crust.  The atmosphere is wonderful, homey, cozy and everyone was friendly.  Even though it was pre-dinner (around 4:30), the place was packed.  We sat, had a pitcher of beer while we waited for our pizza.I have to admit I was pretty disappointed.  While I'm not a deep dish connoisseur, I have had it on plenty of occasions.  I felt the pizza here was a little flat and thin - it didn't have the unctuousness of a deep dish pizza.  The crust was basically just blackened/burned cheese.  It was interesting and chewy for the 1st bite, but the novelty wore off after that, and I began to crave the traditional flaky crust that I associate with deep dish.While I do take responsibility for choosing Pequod's, and I appreciate the traditional twist on the crust, I wouldn't go back.",7,3,negative
436,Sooooooo good. I say this place is a must try when in Chicago! The caramelized crust was awesome and it hit the spot just right.We didn't order anything else except our deep dish and patiently waited till it came out. I recommend coming here hungry and patient. We got lucky and got seated right away but usually it gets busy with a wait. WORTH A TRY! Everyone ends up picking their favorite though depending on their different taste.,8,0,positive

The pizza, the crust, the toppings, the atmosphere. I love it all. I especially recommend going with children because they will think that the caramelized cheese around the rim of the baking dish is ""burnt"" and will give it to you and your mouth and face will rejoice. There is quite a wait here (or has been every time I've gone there) but the good news is that there's an overflow bar next door where you can sit and enjoy a free non-alcoholic beverage. Good thinking, pizza people!",10,0,positive
440,"At the end of my second and final full day in the Windy City, I am reflecting back on my dining experiences in the last 48 hours. I knew before coming that I wanted to be super touristy and try at least one deep dish pizzeria.  Asking for recommendations, I was told about 2 places: Giordano's and Pequod's.  Being the gluttonous Texan and street food connoisseur that I am, I said to myself, ""This seems like a good excuse to eat pizza 2 days in a row!""  So naturally, I had Giordano's yesterday and Pequod's today.Listen to me carefully: Giordano' is milquetoast, moderately halfway decent pizza.  Pequod's on the other hand, is a divine medley of sauce, toppings, and a metric ton of melted cheese practically bursting out of the buttery, garlicky caramelized crust that so precariously holds it all together.  Holy hell is this good pizza.  I ordered the same thing at both establishments--personal pizza with pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, and pineapple (shut up, it's meant to be, and you know it)--and Pequod's just absolutely blew Giordano's out of the water for the same price point.  Everything from the ambience to the friendliness of the staff to the quality of the food was just way better.Pequod's, thank you for putting your goods in my mouth.",9,2,positive
441,One of the best pizza's in Chicago! Its definitely  a must! The crust is the best part. My personal go to is : Italian sausage with giardinera extra well done. There is usually a wait but that is expected - especially on weekends. Delivery is also an option - totally worth waiting.,4,0,positive
442,"The absolute best meatball sub ever invented. Somewhat impossibly, it's even better than their pizza. Been going here for years.",2,1,positive
443,"Of all the Chicago pizzerias I would say Pequods is definitely top 5! If you want to try them during their non busy times, go during their weekday lunch special!! It's $5 for a personal pizza with 1 topping and a drink. What a steal! So far I've had their:- pan pizza with sausage - pan pizza with pepperoni - appetizer plattter (mozz sticks, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, jalapeño poppers)- wings I like their fried mushroom and the pan pizza with sausage. The only reason I didn't give them a 5/5 is because as a native Chicagoan, I assumed it was deep dish, maybe it isnt and really is a pan pizza? There's more dough than cheese, sauce, and toppings. But as a PAN PIZZA, it's good and has a tasty crust",3,4,positive
444,"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, IMO!! I always recommend eating here over Giordano's and Lou Malnati's to out-of-town friends. Everything about Pequod's is significantly better, especially the fact that their crust is seasoned so you're not just eating unflavored cardboard like the other restaurants. Definitely recommend eating here if you're looking for deep dish.",5,0,positive
445,"I figured I should try all the pizzeria Chicago has to offer so this was next on my list. The wait - wasn't too bad considering we came in on a Friday night at 7pm. We only had to wait 1 hour before being seated. The food - we ordered immediately after we were seated knowing how long the pizza would take (about 50 minutes). Ordered a medium which is about 6 slices and perfect for 2-3 people. It's kinda ridiculous that each topping is about $3 so if you want a combo pizza that's about $15 extra for 5 toppings! We got pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil. It was nice that they loaded the pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms considering the price we paid but next time, just skip the basil because it was nonexistent.  Also order the cheesy garlic bread which was mediocre, no marinara sauce to dip. Lastly, a pitcher of beer on tap which was only $18, worth it. The service - our server was sweet and would check in on us every so often but not too much that it was annoying. However, the ones who brought out our food (busboys?) were kinda rude.. when he brought the cheesy garlic bread he dropped the plate on our table, didn't even bother to look at us and just walked away. Overall, it was a different kind of pizza experience but I don't think I will be back. My favorite part of the pizza is the crust but I couldn't eat it because it was so burnt, the whole crust was black.",5,6,negative

448,My first deep dish experience and thank goodness I went to Pequod's! WOW! It's definitely worth the 40 min wait to get your piping hot pie customed to perfection! The lunch deal made it suuuper cheap! I added additional toppings and a salad as well. The crunchy cheese on the sides made the pizza superb. A meal I won't forget!,7,1,positive
449,"I wouldn't call myself a deep dish connoisseur but I've tried my fair share of deep dish chains and pequods is by far the best. That being said, i think many people agree with me and I've always had a long wait (1-2 hours). The bar next door, whale tale, is the perfect place to wait for your table-you can enjoy apps and drinks while you wait too! Once you're seated you normally wait 45-60 mins for deep dish to be made so i recommend getting an appetizer sometime in the process if you're really hungry. But don't worry, the wait will be worth it! The pizza is EXCELLENT. I would say the service is so-so but considering they're always packed, I get it. I try to come here as much as I can when i come to Chicago!",6,1,positive
450,"I think I have found my favorite Chicago deep dish. I am not a native of Chicago and my list of deep dishExperiences are not intense but I have tried a few and this pizza is at the top of my list. Bar like atmosphere equipped with radio and sports playing on TV's. However, it also has an intimate vibe with the variety of guests (families, bar patrons, all ages, etc) and the warm service from the waitresses. You can tell the bar is a staple in the area.Pizza is mostly crust but the crust has a great airy texture. Cheese and toppings are still the main attraction and they are generous with the toppings. Tomato sauce is fresh and you can see traces of actual vegetables in the sauce (my fav). Best crust I have ever had on a deep dish- bye bye to regular butter crust! Loved my visit, wish there were more locations!",11,1,positive

They are also famous for laying cheese all the way over the crust so you get that really crispy burnt cheesy crust on the edge which is amazing! We had both the Lou malnati and pequod back to back within the two days Chicago trip and comparing the two, pequod is a more hearty and rustic. All in all it's a must visit spot in Chicago.",2,1,positive

454,"Amazing deep-dish pizza! The caramelized crust is perfect! The pizza itself is not too cheesy and baked to perfection. We ordered a large pizza for 4 people and it was more than enough, I would recommend skipping out on any appetizers just to make sure you have enough for 1-2 slices. The service is phenomenal and the wait time is reasonable (15-20 to get seated and 50 minutes for the pizza). It's a little out of the way but definitely worth the drive.",8,1,positive
455,"We spent the weekend in Chicago in from South Florida and figured we would need to find the best deep dish pizza while we were there. We came to Pequod's as we had multiple friends from the Chicago area recommend this as the best Chicago pizza. We came after Cubs game and were quite hungry. I was impressed as to how inexpensive the pizza was, we ordered one large pizza and between three of us we only finished about half. The pizza was brought to us in a cast iron pan,And it had a nice caramelized crust. The main reason that I would not choose this location as the best deep dish pizza in Chicago is due to the fact that probably 75% of the pizza was due and the other 25% was toppings and sauce versus other locations which had significantly more toppings and sauce. The pizza was still very enjoyable. If I am ever back in Chicago, I will most likely choose Giordanno's or Lou Malnatti's over Pequod's.",8,0,positive
456,"If this review were based on the pizza alone, it would hands down be 5 stars. Absolutely the best deep dish I've had in Chicago, although I seem to be in the minority that loves Giordano's and only somewhat enjoys Lou's.Went here on a Wednesday night, the wait for a table was only about 20 minutes and the wait for pizza was only about 30. Service was great. Caesar salad and mozz sticks were nothing special whatsoever, but I was only there for the pizza. I raved about it to my parents, so I came back with them on a Friday. BIG MISTAKE.We got there around 5:30, were told the wait was 60-90 minutes and we could hang out at the bar next door and wait. We obliged, got some drinks and wings and patiently waited. When we finally got sat around 60 min later, we obviously wanted to order right away so we could get ta' eating ASAP. The server then informed us that by the way, the wait for pizza right now is 90 minutes. I absolutely believe that this needs to be told to guests as soon as they put their name down to wait for a table. They do have a laminated piece of paper up front saying ""the current wait for pizza is __"" but it said 40 minutes both times I was there, which was overestimated on my first visit and way underestimated on my second.So all in all, if we had waited for a pizza (we didn't - we left), we would have been waiting a total of 2.5 hours to eat. I have waited at Oven Grinder for that long on a weekend night, but I KNEW what to expect because I was told that from the beginning, and once sat the food came out very promptly. If your food is taking 90 min to come out, you either need a bigger kitchen or you need to stop seating tables. Simple as that.Basically, come here early on a week day night or don't come at all.",8,1,negative
457,"I've ordered from them a few times, and I like the ""caramelized crust"" they are known for - but in general, I think the crust is too much bread.  It still all tastes good & you can tell they use good quality ingredients, but I'd only get it if my friends want this one in particular these days.",3,0,positive

The positives were the toppings were premium and quality. The pie was extremely heavy. Now let's get to the negatives- to me the pie was just Average at Best. It lacked flavor and seasoning. It was good trying a new spot, but this spot isn't for me.",2,1,negative
460,"In the ongoing battle of the best Chicago deep dish, I made my way over to Pequod's on a recent trip.What I like about this place is it's not located in the middle of the The Loop tourist trap. You get to see more of Chicago as you trek out here.The restaurant is simple and to the point. It's set up like a classic pizzeria with small tables scattered about and condiments on the table. Read the menu immediately upon sitting as the servers are quick to  take your order since the pizza takes quite a while to cook. I went with a pepperoni deep dish pizza.The pizza was very good, but honestly not as good as I was expecting. Flavors were good so was the sauce, but I have to say that I think Lou Malnati's is better. None the less, I plowed through as much of the pizza as possible and left there full and satisfied.

Our wait was about 40 mins, which is not too awful, and I was excited to try this place after reading all the great reviews.In SF we have a damn fine deep dish place called Little Star pizza. I am more of a NY style pizza fan, thin crust, not too oily, with a dough that is firm but with a little ""give"" when you bite into it. Deep dish and pan are very different animals from that. Their pan pizza was good, but I was kind of put off by the volume of the doughy pie. It was like eating a slab of Italian bread with sauce and toppings. That said, the sauce was tasty, a touch of sweetness complimented by some acidity. The sausage topping was excellent. The waitress did try to overcharge us for two other toppings, as we asked for half toppings and were charged for full, but they quickly sorted it out, albeit with some odd explanation about how their ""system"" can't take into account half toppings being spread over the entire pizza, as opposed to half the pizza. Huh? That would seem to be an easy concept to explain to the line cooks. Nonetheless, all's well that ends well. Would I return? Meh, only if someone else insisted.",10,2,negative

I was so excited to try it, since it looked so good especially with all the toppings (they were not stingy with the toppings, AT ALL). However, once I actually got into the slice it was just ok, which definitely disappointed. I will be giving it another try since I don't think my first time did it justice.",3,3,negative
464,Nice location and very busy when we went. But they were able to accommodate us in a reasonable amount of time. They were able to seat us upstairs. Pizza was bready with a good amount of tomato sauce. Gave it 4 stars considering we were able to experience Chi-Town pizza there.,2,0,positive

It has a caramelized crust and a pan, thick crust pizza. I don't know how they make the crust thick AND crispy, but they have.

The service was absolutely terrible. Shawna S was our waitress and was pretty rude while ordering because we made one minor modication to the order 10 seconds after she walked away from the table. She acted like it was such a chore to simply go in and modify it and gave us an attitude about it. Then, after politely asking why our appetizer took more than 30 minutes, she immediately came back from the kitchen and literally dropped it on our table, causing the sauce to drop all over the bread, while rudely saying that it always took that long for that particular appetizer to be made. The rest of the experience was suppar at best. Really disappointed in this pizza joint and will not be coming back.",7,4,negative
472,"**Vegetarian Friendly**This place is always busy! Definitely a good amount of wait time. Also be prepared to wait for your food because it does take about 45-60 minutes to make one pizza. This is a pan-style pizza as opposed to the traditional Chicago deep dish, but it's equally good. Really enjoyed it because the crust had a nice crisp to it, as opposed to something more soggy/chewy.",5,0,positive

474,"AVOID DELIVERY at all costs...Let me preface this review by saying that I love Pequod's pizza. It's one of my favorite (if not my favorite) pan pizzas of all time.  However, their delivery is horrendous.  I've ordered delivery about 6 times from Pequods. 3 of those times, there have been major issues with the delivery.First of all, delivery takes a while. But they're up front about it. I can live with that. The issue comes in when there are problems with the order itself. Usually when someplace makes a mistake, they own up to it and fix the problem as quickly as possible. Pequods does neither of those things. Let me elaborate on this with respect to today/tonight. From start to ""resolution"" was almost 5 hours. I placed the order at 4 and was told that the order would come in about 2 hours.  It came in a bit less time. Great!  Unfortunately, the salad I ordered was missing.  I called back and eventually got through to a manager who was fairly dismissive and gave me the choice of voiding the salad or having it delivered. I opted to have it delivered, to which she responded by saying that they were very busy and she wasn't sure when we'd get it.  Ok.  This was 6 pm. Fast forward to 8:45. Still no salad and no update.  So I called back and after waiting for about 10 minutes on hold, I finally got an update. The first salad wasn't made (we knew this otherwise, they would have just brought it).  The second was made but the delivery person forgot it on his way out.  This seemed a bit suspect to me, and of course no one will fess up as to whether the salad ever did exist, but what can you do.  In the end, I got through to another manager who offered comping the salad and a $25 gift card for the a future order. I told her that I wanted the entire bill comped given the trouble I'd had. She said that half the bill was the best she could, and I accepted. I told her that I'd never order from Pequods again, to which she responded ok, we're sorry to lose a customer. It seemed insincere.Long story short, Pequods needs to improve their delivery significantly.  50% success is not acceptable and no one should feel like they've done something wrong when they haven't. The bill should have been comped.",9,6,negative

483,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm after the chicago marathon. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer to let us know when our table was ready. There was also a sign at the hostess stand that said pizzas will take 40 min after ordering them. No big deal...we headed to the bar and ordered a drink while we waited. The buzzer went off 10 min later (even though it was supposed to be 25-30min) and we walked to a table upstairs.It was pretty hard getting our waitress' attention once we sat down. We had to ask 2x for waters that finally came 30 min after we originally ordered them. We ordered the jalapeño poppers to start and then got 2 personal 7' deep dish pizza (one meatball/extra sauce and the other with sausage, pepper, onions). Mind you we are fro NY/NJ so are used to eating thin crust or brick oven slices. We enjoyed the deep dish experience but just felt like it was a casserole vs. a slice of pizza! Nothing against pequod's...that is just our own personal preference. The ""pizza"" was super tasty and I'm sure better than the others in town.3 stars not because we didn't like the food but because of the subpar service. It was almost impossible to get a hold of our waitress. I understand it was a busy Sunday after the marathon and with football games, but tolerance only takes you so far.",7,2,negative
484,"Best deep dish pizza ever!!! I've had Pequod's 4 times now (3 being in the restaurant, 1 delivery). If you can, eat inside the restaurant because delivery order just does not taste as good. Ok, let's talk about the pizza. And THE CRUST! The caramelized burnt crust is amazing. It's the best part of the pizza in my opinion. These are my go to toppings:Pepperoni, pineapple, green pepper, mushroom, onion Ordered sausage before and it was just too much on my opinion. As for appetizers, I've gotten the mozzarella sticks and bruschetta. They are both good but nothing special. It's nice to eat some light appetizers if you're waiting 40-50 minutes for your pizza.",5,0,positive

486,"After a year of living in the Windy City, I've finally gotten the chance to try Pequod's to see what the hype was all about in regards to ""Chicago's Best Deep Dish Pizza!""Then I realized that everything is relative to what you like in a pizza. is it the sauce, the cheese, the dough, etc. If you are a bread fan, then this place will certainly live up to your expectations. But if you're like me, then you'll just find this to be another great deep dish variant, but not the most ""amazing"" one that I've ever bitten into.For starters, Pequod's reputation means that it gets busy no matter the time or day. My friend and I came here for a New Year's lunch, and luckily called in to ""get priority."" We essentially skipped to the top of the line once we arrived because we called in early to make a semi-reservation. I suggest that you do the same!We were seated at a booth and I really loved the layout of the restaurant. I felt like it had just enough space without feeling overcrowded, and loved the brick walls and sports bar vibe.Our meal started with their Fried Sampler plate which was bomb. Loved the mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers the most. About 20 minutes later, our large deep dish pizza came out with sausage, Canadian bacon, green peppers, and basil. Each topping was an additional $2.50 on top of the pizza price.Right off the back, the pizza smelled real good and I could tell that it was a lot of bread! Pequod's is known for its quality dough, and I can see why! The thin tomato sauce layer held together some amazing pieces of meat. I would say that the best sausage on a deep dish pizza was definitely from here.Personally, I prefer a deep dish with more cheese, sauce, and toppings rather than the dough itself. Because of this, I can't really call this the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, but it truly is one of the best I've had. If you're into bread, then this is surely for you!",17,3,negative
487,"Ok so I'm just going to get right into this:The pizza is so disappointing. If you're in Chicago for a few days and are in the mood to try deep dish I would avoid this. The reason I'm saying that is because it is seriously just all crust. So much bread and very little topping. To have an equal balance of both is preferred but the proportions were way off. They bring it out in a skillet and honestly it was over cooked. I don't want slightly charred pizza at all. Maybe I'm being a snob about this since I come from NYC and we are all about the pizza (albeit thin crust or ""regular""). The sausage was good but the pieces were so thick that they had only put 3. Instead of spread it around by cutting it into smaller pieces.The seating was ok, there are two large floors which is helpful although the wait to sit was about an hour and the wait for our pizza almost another hour. Half of our floor was empty for good reason since there was no AC! So a hot kitchen putting off hot air onto the top floor of a building is not fun at all. I do like that you get to customize your pizza in terms of size and toppings. That's wonderful. I also loved the Whale Tale next door. The service was also wonderful and a good selection of drinks. But I will not recommend this place unless someone I know is really in the mood for a lot of bread.",14,2,negative

489,"My husband and I were disappointed by the pizza here. After going to Lou malnatis (which was so delicious!)  we were told by the locals to go here saying it was amazing and it's where all the locals go for deep dish pizza. Honestly, the wait itself wasn't bad. We were told the wait would be 20-45 minutes then another 60 minutes for the pizza to be made. I think we waited 15 min to be seated and maybe 40 minutes for the pizza to come out. And this was Sunday night around 530. They also let you wait at a bar two doors down the block if the restaurant bar is full. We ordered a small sausage mushroom pan pizza. The pizza was not hot at all. My husband and I were actually able to touch the pizza pan with our whole hand and it felt just warm. I don't know why they had to carry it or with the special tong things. The pizza dough was so THICK. It's like a 4:1 ratio. I'm not even sure it was baked fully cuz I thought it tasted a bit soggy. The sausage tasted overwhelmingly of fennel seeds. The only compliment we had was that they used real mushrooms instead canned. We walked out agreeing we liked the broccoli cheddar bites we had at the bar next door while waiting for our table.",7,2,negative

495,"So normally this place is on point when it comes to pizza (thin and deep dish) but I ordered a thin crust last night (7/28/17) and I think the cook was mad at life or something and took it out on my order. I ordered fried mushrooms, a 12 inch thin crust with meatball, mushroom, & onion, a can of Coke & a can of Sprite. -1The Price: First of all that all came out to $40 prior to the tip (yikes) so I expected the normal magical unicorn dust flavors that Pequod's produces for the price. Nay kind Sir or Madam reader, here's how pizza night went downhill fast...-1The Appetizer: Well the mushrooms had breading that was too salty, and the mushrooms themselves had a weird after taste; like someone spit cinnamon Big Red gum in them before breading them!-1The Pizza: The pizza itself was a whole other hot mess: too much flavorless sauce and an ABUNDANCE of onions. I like onions...but I don't know anyone who likes them this much. I mean they were under the cheese, in the cheese & then for the piece de resistance, on top of the cheese. It looked like someone loaded a tee shirt cannon with onions and shot it on the pizza dead center. As for the meatballs (which should have been the star) it looked like someone took ah(uno/one) meatball chopped it into millionths and then placed the meatball dust on the pizza. The crust was thick and soooper dry. It sapped all the moisture out of my mouth like a 3ply industrial paper towel once it hit my tongue. The abundance of sauce should have helped the crust situation but again if you recall it was flavorless & tasted tinny. It tasted almost as though the sauce went from can to pizza. This all made for a terrible Friday pizza night. I know you guys get busy but everything is still usually always at the top of the pizza game. I don't want to believe that Pequod's is slipping because it's normally fantastic, but the only thing that tasted right in this order were the cans of pop! So one of you guys need to pop back into the kitchen and give the dude (or dudette) that preps your pizza a hug & a raise or something before this type of quality becomes a Pequod's standard.",16,8,negative
496,"The first dinner of the bachelor party was Chicago deep dish at Pequod's. I've been to all the other places in Chicago, so I saved this one for the party. There were 14 guys, and we ordered two large pies. Order a few pitchers of beers, and that's enough for all. We ordered one pie with sausage and pepperoni and the other was a cheesy garlic pie. I'm getting hungry just writing this review, but they were both great. Caramelized crust, and delicious toppings. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm coming back here for more.",3,1,positive
497,"I've tried Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, and this. I think after these three experiences, I have to say that overall I'm really not a deep dish pizza fan. In terms of ranking, I'd say that Giordano's goes at the bottom for me (I gave them a 2/5 in my review). Lou Malnati's would come second best with a 3/5, and if there were half stars, Pequod's a 3.5/5. I was starving by the time I got to Pequod's, and everything tastes better when you're hungry. For appetizers, four of us split the combo which came with zucchini slices, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, breaded shrooms (not the drug kind), and onion rings. they were okay- the veggies were pretty juicy, the batter was crispy, and the dipping sauce paired well, but it's nothing memorable. and again, I don't think they would've tasted as ""good"" if I hadn't been so damn hungry (I'd give it 3.5/5).We split a large pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and green peppers. The reason why I rank this place above the two others is because the whole pizza actually had some flavor and the crust was nice and buttery-tasting compared to Lou Malnati's and Giordano's which I thought both fell flat in terms of just being tasteful- I don't know what they lack, salt? butter? the sauce doesn't have enough spices? the dough just tastes like bland dough? not sure but what they lacked in their deep dish, Pequod's made up for it a bit better, and the browned cheese was delish. I'd still give a 3.5 to Pequod's deep dish pizza though, cause it came out mostly burnt on the sides (don't eat burnt stuff yo, it's cancerous) and deep dish just leaves me way too full to feel good about myself. It was okay and I'd recommend this above the other two but still not something I'd go around raving about and saying it's something you HAVE to try.",12,7,negative

If you have never been here, you're missing out. If you plan on coming here, be prepared to wait during peak times. Most people waiting at Pequods end up waiting at the bar next door. If you ordered drinks or food at the bar next door and you are called at Pequods, the bar will actually call Pequods to hold your table!

Now, apply this logic determining what you value in pizza to determine which deep dish place is your favorite. Pequod's ain't perfect, but it can be perfect depending on your pizza preferences. In my college heyday, I gorged myself with quite a bit of Giardano's and Lou's, but never got around to trying what many deemed to be the ""best deep dish"" in town aka Pequod's. What I got: Personal size half sausage, and half ground beef + basilCrust: PERFECTION. Described to be a ""caramelized"" crust and boy, can you see it! Giardano's has the soggy cardboard crust of death. Lou's crust has great taste but still can get dry or mush in the middle. Pequod's has a beautiful crunchy crust THROUGHOUT including the middle bottom. Tell me thy saucery!Everything else: sausage was pretty bland, Lou's sausage is by far superior. I also like the ground beef itself by Giardano's better. Passing grade for the cheese. I did like the fact that the sauce is not too watery.Atmosphere: very casual, has seating upstairs and downstairs, 45min or more to get your pizza cooked depending on how busy it is. Bar and hockey type of atmosphere.Bottom line: If perfect crust is what you desire - this is a must go. Too soon to call it for me in regards to the superiority of this to Lou's, definitely better than Giardano's and Uno's. May not be worth it for an extra long wait though.

We have been waiting for 2 hour and 45 mins. The hostess at front kept telling us that you are next. However, we 5 people, were standing right next to her and saw another group of 5 just came in. And the same hostess led their way to seating. We were shocked and felt it was very rude. She still kept saying that you are next and the other group has priority seating - which we never heard of or you forget to tell us?? If we are not next, please just be honest. Because the other group are Caucasians, and we are Asians? You honestly treated us differently because we kept seeing people behind us were seated. Second, after almost 3 hour wait, you give us the table for 4 people. We are group of 5. We seated - very uncomfortable and crowded. We saw the table behind us - which can fit 5 people, we politely asked the waitress - can we switch to that table? Because they are done. The waitress says that she has to ask the front. Shortly she came back and said to us that - that 5 people table need to give for group of more people. Excuse me? We saw 5 people just sitting there and they left. And you told us that table need to wait for more than 5 people? So the entire time we were sitting at 4 people table and we saw the table behind us - which can fit 5 people was empty the whole time.

Everyone has their preferences and gripes about deep dish pizza.What I will say is that deep dish isn't something I can eat as often as thinner crust pizza. It's a special kind of thing, which is what I like about Pequod's. It's got that feeling of an old-style dine-in pizzeria that makes me feel like I'm a kid again, coming to a pizza joint with my friends after soccer practice or something. It's got TVs, goofy shit on the walls, but serves beer. It's like Chuck E. Cheese's out-of-work uncle who smokes Pall Malls and buys underage kids booze.

The caramelized crust is out of this world - I could slice off just the outsides of the pizza and eat it by itself. BUT enjoying the pizza bit my bit and getting to the crust at the end of each slice is just as good of a reward.

I decided to try this one out my next time in Chicago because it seems as though it's more of a Sicilian pizza than deep dish. For starters the wait was an hour on a Thursday night, which is fine I don't complain about lines especially when the place is actually packed and all seats are being used. The pizza, something was great about it and something was lacking. While it comes out looking beautiful, it just didn't have A TON of flavor. But then I loved it because it was a good Sicilian pizza. I'm not sure, tbh I really couldn't put my finger on whether or not I loved it or it was decent. I think next time I visit I'll go again during a time it's not as busy.",7,2,positive

It was a great experience, however, we tried the traditional deep dish pizza and some appetizers. The pizza was very good, but our wings came out cold and soggy. We sent them back and they apologized and gave us new ones. They didn't comp us, and the wings came out 20 minutes after we sent them back, so by the time we got them back, the pizza was coming out too so it was annoying. The food still tasted great, just disappointed on how it all went!",5,3,negative

532,"I couldn't give Pequod's less than 5 stars. I've been here on multiple accounts and received nothing but great service and quality food (BIG PORTIONS). I love deep dish and I love cheese pulls. Each slice of these pies are solid cheese pull slices. I think what makes their deep dish different (and my favorite part about the pizza personally) is the burnt cheese crust. It's a surprisingly amazing taste and unfortunately something I'm craving most days. Don't be turned off by the ""burnt"" description because it couldn't be done any other way. The deep dish is delish! 5 STARS PEQUODS!! Side note: you will most likely be put on a wait. Don't give Pequod's 4 stars because you had to wait 45 mins-Hour to be sat down. This place is televised and is truly a Chicago gem. Tourist and locals flock here. Worth the wait so just keep that in mind when writing your own review!",7,1,positive
533,"SoCal native just visiting the area.Had to try the famous Chicago deep dish!The crust is the best! Sauce was a little bland, and the basil was hardly noticeable. But overall the pizza was worth a try. Visited pretty early on a Saturday (1pm) and it wasn't packed. I think they had about 6 beers on tap. Noticed a Sculpin IPA-- little taste of my hometown San Diego, ha. Pretty good, stomach-filling pizza!",5,1,positive
534,"Never order delivery from these idiots.   They screwed up the order by putting jalapeño peppers on my pizza.  Then when I called the manager tried to give me a credit for a future  pizza and assume that I should just eat pizza with jalapeño peppers.  I explained these would make me sick.  He said they would send another pizza in an hour.  It has been 90 minutes and no second pizza.  They do not answer my calls.  Note that drivers have no change.  Another reason not to do business with this disreputable company.  I've eaten in the restaurant several times and the pizza is great.  When it's busy they fail at customer service.  To be fair, a manager contacted me Video yelp to try to straighten this message out. However his efforts were pathetic. He stated that he wanted to resolve the issue but stood with his manager who banned me.  Then invited me to return. When I pointed out that I did not want to go in there and then be asked to leave, he did not continue the conversation.  While I understand that yelling and using profanity is no way to resolve a situation, they seem to think nk that people should just quietly take being ignored and mistreated when they make mistakes.  I did not get angry until my second or third call three hours after the ordeal began.  Their system has no way of tracking mistakes and service recovery efforts. So I stand by my original advice to not order delivery from them.",4,6,negative

541,"It was okay. I'm a Chicago native and their restaurant was an average sports-related jock place with fairly good pizza. I wasn't super impressed the way some people are. But some people are also garbage. I must stress that I did not DISLIKE this place, but it also was not interesting or wildly unique. It brings the Southwest side -- where I grew up (by Midway) --to the Northside, which is why I posit that people up here love it and think it's amazing. Whereas it's just the same stuff I grew up with.",7,3,positive
542,"We came here at 11pm right after we landed at O'Hare. It was a great treat to have our first meal in Chicago be what it's most famous for, the deep dish pizza! And I have to say that Pequods didn't disappoint. We ordered a small deep dish to share, which was huge! It was enough for both of us to have again for breakfast one morning. The pizza came out very fresh and hot, and you definitely know it was made to order since it takes 45 min to wait for it! The wait was a little long but worth it. I would definitely recommend to come here!",8,1,positive
543,"I grew up in the Chicago area, so Pequod's has had a special place in my heart for a long time, and I've gladly eaten it like 6 times in the past few months. However, last night was the last time I'll be there. My group of 5 arrived and was told there'd be a 30-45 minute wait, so we eventually took our buzzer and went to the bar next door to wait. After a period of less than 5 minutes, in which no alcohol was consumed (because we'd barely even been seated), our buzzer went off and we took our seats at Pequod's. Some of my party members wanted beer to start off, and our whole table was refused alcohol service, eventually citing one of our friends as the reason after we pried for justification. As everybody there had years of restaurant experience we understand the rules and procedures. The problem is that the basis for their claim that we were over-served was our friend's speech and movement, which is actually her regular speech and movement and is related to physical trauma from months ago. After explaining this to management, they stuck to their decision and offered no acknowledgement that this may be offensive or discriminatory. Our friend was saddled with the guilt of being the reason we all left the restaurant in anger. This could have, and should have been handled with much more tact. It is situations like this that often get hospitality businesses into legal trouble, and Pequod's management needs an attitude fix to avoid this in the future. It's a real shame we all grew up loving this place, but now there's a stain on our memory of it. The manager we dealt with gave us the name Joel.",4,9,negative

546,"Been here twice now and can say it's officially my favorite deep dish (or pan is what they call it or stuffed etc... the crazy excessive fat delicious chicago style pizza!). To me it comes down to the crust. It light, buttery and crumbly with the caramelized crust. Our favorite topping is with sausage and giardiniera Mmmmmmmmm.First time came on a Saturday night, it's a nightmare, 2 hour wait then 45min wait for pizza once you order. Went today Sunday lunch at 1pm, walked right in, no wait for a table. So I'd recommend lunch time for sure to not have the wait dampen the experience!",5,3,positive
547,"I understand taste and preference is an individual experience, but I have had better pizza.  I prefer Due and that type of crust.Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good, it's the management that is a problem.  My assistant booked a reservation for me and a few clients - one just in from Scotland that very day.  We arrived 20 minutes early.  We were told we would probably not be seated for more than an hour.  When we pressed that we had a reservation, we were told that we were put on a list, but the seating time is not guaranteed.  I assure you, this was not communicated when the ""reservation"" was made.  An hour later, we were still seated outside, waiting.  My assistant called and asked to speak to the manager (I didn't force her or anything, she was upset with the whole situation - I had also talked to the management myself).  The manager told her we were not there. She had to describe what we were wearing.  Now, the manager had already been outside, called our party's name and we replied accordingly.  He walked back inside.  So, he knew we were there, told my assistant we weren't and it was officially an issue.  Twenty minutes later, the manager came out, said he was sorry for the confusion, assigned blame to my assistant and we were seated.  Unless you have all day to wait or just don't mind, Pequod's has tasty pizza.   Personally, the management's ruined the experience and we won't be back.",4,6,negative

Pizza isn't great. The first time I dined here the vegetables taste like they were canned, and the pizza tasted a little odd. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went again. The poppers taste like they were bought from a frozen pack as well as the marinara. The pizza didn't taste any better this time. Since my boyfriend likes their pizza we ordered again for pickup, this time the pizza was much better and I enjoyed it. No veggies this time around, perhaps that's why. Chicago has much better pizza options but I guess this place is worth trying.",14,2,negative
550,"If I ever crave deep dish, this is my go to spot. When I have out of town visitors, I recommend this place over anything else. The pizza is delicious, thick and I dare say JUICY (with cheese). The absolute best part is the crust. It's hard and chewy and delicious. It's so good a lactose intolerant person like me thinks it's worth the pain to come once I'm done. Typically I order sausage for my toppings, but I've also had giardiniera (yum) and green pepper mixed in. It's hard to go wrong. One or two slices are filling, so this place is great for groups OR for someone that's extremely hungry. Speaking of groups, there is an upstairs space for seating if you have larger parties. I've also tried their meatball sandwich, tasty, but I wouldn't make a trip out here for that. The only con is that the wait times are so very long, so this isn't a spot I come to without planning for a wait. Keep in mind, you also have to wait a while for the pizza since it takes a while to make it (like all deep dish). I recommend doing priority seating online, which isn't really a reservation, but it does help with the wait sometimes.",10,3,positive
551,Order the deep dish To Go and the pizza was 95% all crust-very little cheese and sauce. It was good but due to the overwhelming amount of crust I would have to say this is my least favorite Chicago deep dish pizza. My first experience was dine in and we loved it so not sure if dine in vs pickup is the difference.  Are they skimping on the cheese and the sauce totally or only pickup?  The whole group was disappointed and especially me for suggesting.,3,1,negative

555,"I was prepared for a wait, so when I called for delivery and was quoted an hour and a half, I was cool with that. 2 1/2 hours and multiple phone calls later, our pizza arrived.And if the pizza was amazing, the wait would have been mostly forgiven. But it was not amazing. I'm sure the fact that it had been sloshing around in a warming bag in the delivery guy's car for an hour didn't help, but the pizza sucked. The bottom crust was super thick, super flavorless, and a mysterious combo of crumbly and mushy. The sauce and the sausage were good, but the rest of the toppings were generic, boring, and in the case of the garlic, still super raw. If you have to eat here, I'd recommend eating in the restaurant, but I've had significantly better pizza at a number of other Chicago places, so I'd give this one a miss.",9,2,negative
556,"Five star for sure!This pizza is amazing.  I find some deep dish style pizzas to be a little much - I'm more of a thin crust guy, but this really hit all the marks for me.  Toppings were plentiful and nicely toasted, crust was absolutely incredible and there was a good overall balance between sauce, cheese, and crust.I'd go out of my thin crust comfort zone for this any time.Service was good as pizza places goes, no complaints there whatsoever.  Will definitely be back!",7,1,positive
557,"Chicago has so many options for deep dish or pan pizza, but that caramelized cheese crust sets Pequod's apart from everywhere else. I usually like to save my crust for last to dip into whatever fallen toppings are on the plate, but that crust is just too good to wait. Eating at Pequod's means that you may wait for 45+ minutes for a table, but fresh in the restaurant is the best way to eat it. I've ordered it for pick and delivery and while it's good, it doesn't stand to the excellence of dining in. Their sauce is so well seasoned, the crust is crispy and they have fun toppings to choose from (pineapple, variety of olives... what can I say, I'm easy to please) and it even tastes good reheated. Waiting to dine in or delivery can be a little tedious, but once you're eating that pizza it's easy to forgive and forget.  Pequod's is a vessel filled with crispy, cheesey, gooey, oily goodness and my mouth is Moby Dick and I'm gonna destroy and consume everyone and everything on board.",14,3,positive
558,"Delivery Review Only! I had a pretty bad experience with Pequod's recently. They delivered the wrong pizza (it was the delivery guy's fault, my name wasn't even on the receipt), I rang them up and they said they'd replace it with the right one. Great, right? The next delivery guy shows up and demanded a $3 delivery fee?!?!? I'm like, dude I already paid that fee for the first pizza and you guys messed it up. He wasn't having it so I told him to take the delivery fee from the other driver who messed up. At the very least, Pequod's could have handled this...I don't know if it's because I was upset, but as I started in on the new pizza I realized it's pretty much just bread...you don't even really get the carmelized crust with delivery.I think it's better at the restaurant because they serve it in the pans and the bread it warmer, but I will never order delivery again and I may take a long term pass on the restaurant due to the bothersome interaction.",7,5,negative
559,"Stellar deep dish and different than the typical giordanos, Gino's, and Lou's. The crust here is different, and the sausage is made in house apparently. These differentiating factors make the pizza here unbelievably tasty and heavy! Great with a refreshing beer to wash it down. I also like starting with a salad, and their house salad is a great starter to the meal. Even super crowded on a Monday afternoon, so that tells you something about their delicious pizza.I wasn't a big fan of the service though I have to admit. This is probably the only reason pequod's isn't a five star joint for me, but excellent pizza and vibes nonetheless!",6,2,positive
560,"When in... Chicago, you must try a deep dish pizza. It is my first go at a Chicago style pizza & my friend picked the best place that offers generous portions of toppings, cheese & red sauce.

I can also taste the fresh ingredients, which makes this pizza a standout as well.",8,0,positive

I hate writing bad reviews because these establishments have real people working to make a living. But I am appalled by the number of fake positive reviews and inflated rating.None of these people here who give good reviews of this place have probably ever had real good pizza. I don't get the raving great reviews and horribly regret going here. Of all the good places to go eat, we went here and had to go out of our way to get here, in hopes the pizza would be delicious. It took us a 30 minute drive from downtown to come to this rickety area. That is usually a good sign but not for this place.There was a very slim layer of cheese on the pizza. It was 90% bread, 9.99% sauce and maybe close to 1 % of actual cheese. It tasted more like a burnt garlic bread, minus the good flavor. I shouldve went to the grocery store and bought some Texas toast. Would've been worth it more than this atrocious round bread.Please take a look at my pictures of the pie we received. It looks nothing like a pizza. And tastes nothing like one.To make a long story short: the waitress was so dismissive and oblivious half the time. She forgot we needed to order ( you have one job) then tried to be abnormally fake, extra sweet to our toddler. So much so that even he said he didn't want to be there.The atmosphere was more like a pub or bar. It reeked of stale liquor and was dark, and cramped. Such a joke. Not to mention THE 40 MINUTES IT TOOK TO MAKE IT.40 minutes??? To burn some bread?? LOL. okay.You want pizza???? Real nice, thick, cheesy, goey, delicious pizza???

566,"Not sure about all of the rough reviews, because Pequod's was amazing! We ended up here late on a Saturday night after the Patriots game ended from Tripoli's tavern. It was our first night in Chicago so we were looking for a deep dish fix and thankfully Pequod's had late night hours to accommodate us. Service was top notch from the moment we stepped in until we left. Our waitress was friendly and peppy and explained the menu, jumping us right to the page with the deep dish (she knew) and explaining how many servings/pieces each size of pizza was (whether you would have leftovers or not). She also indicated the 'wait time' as some are calling it or how long it takes them to make you an amazing pizza. Geez, people. We opted for the small pan pizza with pepperoni, jalapeño and Italian sausage and an order of cheese bread with homemade, I repeat HOMEMADE marinara. The marinara was amazing and the bread was also pretty great and came out quick after our order was taken. The wait for the pizza was probably less than what was quoted to us.  The pizza--came served hot, oh so delicious and flavorful. We loved the burnt, crisp crust, a different spin on deep dish. The Italian sausages were ginormous and it was stacked with pepperoni (worth that extra charge per topping). I was only sad that I couldn't finish my pizza in one sitting. And, prices were so reasonable-our bill was under $30. We also had Gino's on this trip, and while a classic staple of Chicago, it didn't compare to the food quality received at Pequod's. I would love to try them again next time I am in town.",16,2,positive

It was a Friday night so we knew we would have to wait...luckily our friend called ahead and put our names down for call ahead seating. We ended up only waiting about 10 minutes for our table of 4.

I also have never had giardiniera before - and that was life changing!",4,0,positive
569,Solid deep dish option. A little less thick than other varieties in the area but just as food. The charred crust is definitely the most note-worthy part of the pizza. The small is huge and sauce is delicious. The anchovies are good with salty goodness. The best part is they deliver pretty far. Pequod's is a great option for late night eats. But give yourself an hour and half for sure if delivery.,6,0,positive
570,"We had unfortunate car trouble that kept us from going back home to MKE, so we did an intensive search to find Chicago pizza on Christmas Day! We were happy to find that this very popular place was open so late at night. It was pretty late (maybe already 10pm), so we were only picking up, but inside it was surprisingly very busy! I think the staff were surprised too at how many people would be coming out on a cold Christmas night! We thoroughly enjoyed solid Chicago style pizza with their ""carmelized"" crust. Very filling on a cold Christmas night. Would definitely look to try again and consider braving the Wait to sit down.",5,4,positive

574,Sorry but pequod's lost their recipe when the millenials took over in the kitchen. I remember it being way better. Thin crust was actually thin and the sauce was really good.

It really didn't have a lot of flavor and the crust didn't seem all the way done.

576,The atmosphere is very casual and local. You are welcomed with pretty friendly service. They are nice and patient. The pizza is less doughy and saucy compared to all the other deep dish pizzas.

584,"This was my first time eating deep dish pizza and o boy was I impressed. I came on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait. When I thought about deep dish pizza, I thought that it would be a thin crust surrounding the pan filled with sauce and cheese. However, there is more crust than I had imagined and it is so light and fluffy, which is something I had never experienced when eating pizza. There was just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and they didn't overdo it with the toppings. It wasn't that oily either, which is unlike the pizza I have had in New York. I loved it especially the cheese that crisped up on the side of the cast iron pan. My friend and I got a large pizza with sausage and pepperoncini on one side and pineapple and Canadian bacon on the other (don't judge my friend really likes pineapple on pizza). If you like spice, definitely get pepperoncini. We could not finish the large even though we wanted to and would get a medium next time. This is a must try if you are like me and have never been to Chicago before!",6,0,positive

586,"Decided to go visit the Pequod on North Clybourn Avenue after the movies. The host began to lead us to the upstairs section. I requested to be seated downstairs since my boyfriend couldn't walk up the steep, what appeared to be at least a 20 step staircase. The host refused and began to explain that they were only seating guests upstairs since they wanted to give the wait staff a final rush. The restaurant had PLENTY of open seating in the lower level. Upon requesting for the manager, the manager sternly said this is a regular procedure. After discussing several options with the manager on-duty. He finally agreed to let us sit at the bar, place an order and wait for his server downstairs to get off of her 20 minute break before moving to a table on the main level. 2 minutes after sitting at the bar, looking over the menu. Another handful of guests began to trickle into the restaurant. After another minute, he screamed ""Busy (another hostess's name), take them to table 7."" Three additional groups after us were immediately guided to seats on the lower level. WTF. Aren't restaurants in business to serve customers and maximize efficient table turns? Perhaps this place needs to reconsider their 'policies'. Here is my point. You had open seats with at least 12 tables open, why couldn't your patrons who clearly expressed the inability to walk up the flight of stairs not be accommodated. All this angst was uncalled for and has made this visit most likely my last visit.",3,4,negative
587,"My favorite Chicago pizza joint by far. I skip out on the flashy tourist joints like Lou Malnati's every time I come back to the city, and head straight here instead. The numerous positive reviews are accurate, very homey down-to-earth midwestern vibes. The caramelized pan crust is phenomenal, I appreciate it when places focus as much of their effort on the crust as they do for the toppings.  Simple, and great quality. Service was efficient and very nice.",10,0,positive

590,"I had guests over on a Sunday night and had called the night before to place the order. On Sunday morning, I called to remove a pizza as some guests were not going to be able to stop by. The pizza was supposed to come at 7pm, it did not come until 8. By that time the crust was extremely soggy and the pizza was lukewarm. When the driver handled me the receipt, it still listed all three pizzas (and the price for 3) despite the fact that he only had the two. He assured me that they were working on the refund for the pizza I asked them to remove. A few days later the charge posted and didn't reflect the refund so I called to ask. The manager assured me the refund should post by Friday and told me to wait. I checked today and no refund had posted. I called again today and the manager informed me that no one on their end had worked on a refund nor put any notes about a refund in the system. He first incorrectly told me that ordered 4 pizzas and received 3, which was not the case. After needing to walk him through it, he finally initiated what I hope to be an actual refund. This should not have taken this many calls and due diligence on my end to remedy their mistake. Extremely unprofessional, don't waste your time here. Get Lou's instead.",10,2,negative

592,"Oh the caramelized crust!!!...Honestly my favorite pizza ever, anywhere. It differs from the traditional deep dish pizzas found elsewhere in the city. More along the lines of pan style that must be attacked by knife and fork. Having been to the Pequod's in Morton Grove originally. I fell in love. So when it was time to visit my family for the holidays. This was my first stop immediately leaving the airport. I've been craving it for over a year since my move to San Diego. And it did not disappoint. We got my go-to deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno. The cheese gets crispy and caramelized along the edge providing that crunch to go with the soft dough and buttery pie-like bottom crust. The toppings are plentiful and savory.",4,2,positive

Thick, heavy, BURNT and dry are all of the textures and qualities I get from Pequod's. Long waits, loud angry suburban patrons and rude waiters trudge through the hype to an expensive, and unpleasant dining experience. Last time I made the mistake of visiting we tried some wings, which, alike the pizza, were dry and disappointing. The had the added bonus of having a generic taste to them as well.For me, even the chains like Uno and Lous beat Pequod's, but Exchequer will always have my heart.",3,7,negative

601,"I love the pizza here. It's unlike your typical deep dish pizzas in this city. Caramelized crust and fresh veggies are on point! This was until I dined in . . . Within 5 minutes of sitting down I felt like I was working in the kitchen and making the pizzas myself. Soooo hot in there! On top of that, I had to sit in this heat for over an hour waiting on my pizza. And I wasn't the only one. My poor server was SWEATING to the point where I thought her perspiration was going to drop on my pizza when it finally came. She was cute though In all, love the pizza but can this place invest in some AC? Judging by how busy it is, I know they can afford it. I'll come back in the winter when I need to warm up.",9,0,negative
602,"Pequod's chooses to focus on crust over cheese. This deep dish pizza has a biscuit like buttery crust that is covered with a thinner layer of sauce and cheese than competing deep dish stores. Their signature caramelized crust is actually a layer of cheese on the outside side edge and is fantastic, albeit a little burnt. But no complaints from me, huge fan of burnt cheese. Wait can be long, but there is a nice bar next door that you can grab a drink while waiting. Still a thin crust pizza fan at heart but enjoyed the change of style for the evening.",5,1,positive

Maybe because it took forever, it was soggy and not crispy, but either way, so doughy. While flavorful, it wasn't worth it IMO...",2,3,negative
604,"Usually, the wait is quite long to be seated. I recommend coming during the weekdays because we were seated right away. Reservations are not allowed but you can call ahead. They inform you ahead of time that pizza takes 40 minutes to be served, which was pretty accurate. My friend and I ordered a small pan pizza with pepperoni, jalapeños, and extra cheese. The small comes with 4 total slices which was plenty for both of us to share. My friend wanted the extra cheese which was a good call because it made the pizza taste that much better. The pepperoni was well seasoned and crispy around the edges just how I like it. The caramelized crust can be a hit or miss. Half of the pizza was caramelized perfectly but the other half was pretty burnt making it hard to eat. It's a great place to try if you want to try other pizza besides Giordano's and Lou's.",12,1,negative
605,"Ok, so after what must have been a year of planning, procrastinating and failing to get into this place for dinner, a group of us finally braved the wait, the 50-minute pizza prep time and went in.The good - the pan pizza (we got pepperoni with pepperoncini) was REALLY EXCELLENT. Long after my stomach was overfull with the pizza my taste buds were still craving for yet another slice. Seems like a sure way to pick up some serious weight...The less good - the service is somewhat rough. There seemed definitely to be a feeling of ""we're so good and so popular that we'll do what we want, treat you how we want to and if you don't like it there are a 100 people waiting behind you"". Yes, yes, you're good and popular and all, but service is still supposed to matter. This is the only reason for my not giving 5 stars. I hope they pay more attention to that.Still a great experience.",9,2,positive

607,The best deep dish pizza in Chicago hands down. Their burnt cheese crust is amazing. Be prepared for a wait almost any time you go in. It's very popular since they only have one location near downtown. Here is how I would compare it to the competition. Pequod's is the best overall. Giordano's has the best quality cheese. And Lou Malnati's has the best sausage pizza. Chicago Oven Grinders is another unique beast of its own that's definitely worth trying. Avoid Gino's East if you can.,7,0,positive

Pizza came 20 min late after a 1.5 hr original estimate, so nearly two hours wait which we were both totally prepared for to get an excellent pizza. When the pie finally did arrive, the bottom of the box was completely soggy as if it had been resting in a puddle for an hour and the delivery driver offered some free cheese bread as a consolation. In most cases we probably wouldn't even have eaten it, but we were starving and out $45 so we are it. It was disgustingly soggy as you can imagine.We'll never order delivery here again and I don't recommend any one else does either.

Personal favorite toppings - giardiniera + basilMake sure you eat it there as the crust has a 15 min tasty life otherwise gets soggy and need to put back in the oven.

617,"I will start by saying I was overly hyped for this pizza so maybe that's why I put it at 3.5 stars. We got there and there were told it was a 45 minute wait for pizza once you ordered it. Cool, thats what I expected. We were meeting a friend who lives in Chicago (we were in town from Houston) We were put on a wait and given a pager to notify us when a table was ready. After 20 minutes we went back to find out how much longer because if it was going to be 20-30+ more we were going to go next door and have some drinks to pass time. They told us 10 minutes. Finally at 20 minutes we asked again and they already had us marked off even though our pager never went off and we had moved from outside, to inside the door because it was windy. They were able to get us seated promptly.  We ordered drinks. I ordered a gin martini, and yes I know its a pizza place so i wont complain that it wasn't great, thats on me. The beers I had to follow were cold. The salad we ordered was fresh and the dressing was really great. The appetizer combo was good (fried zucchini was my favorite) Then...our pizza. The cheese crust beautiful thing I had been waiting for since I saw it on tv some time ago. The gentleman that brought it out was courteous and asked if he could serve the first slice and we accepted. The pizza looked great. It just didn't taste as great as I thought it would. I have had other Chicago pizzas, and although this one wasn't bad...it wasn't my favorite.  I felt like there could be a little less breading, with more sauce and toppings. The cheese crust was good but not as flavorful as I was expecting either. I dont think my review should keep anyone away, because I was overall happy with the visit.

That would probably sound cooler if I was the actual bodybuilder, but it was actually my friend so instead it was time to pig out and see how fast I could go from fat to fatter. The servers were über-friendly and the pizza arrived in stages but looked great. We ordered pizzas with peppers and sausage, mushrooms and ham and even a basic pepperoni thin crust pizza  for the annoying, picky guy (me). I inhaled my entire pizza and thankfully, the servers were gracious with the coke refills to keep my momentum going. The other kids at the table ordered and devoured the bruschetta in record time and everyone seemed to love their pizza. I'm from New York and not a fan of deep dish Chicago style which is why I ordered a thin crust pie. It also explains my pizza snobbery and why I'd be unwilling to grant five stars to anything that didn't knock my socks off. But again, this is good pizza. Great atmosphere.

635,"One of the trademarks of Chicago cuisine is its deep dish pizza. While the origins are unclear, deep dish has been a critical defining element of Chicago food for decades, and every time I visit Chicago, I am compelled to go to at least one deep dish pizzeria.Having tried Giordano's and Lou Malnati's in the past, I decided to give Pequod's a try. Located in Lincoln Park, it was rather out of the way of everything else I wanted to do (namely sightseeing in the Loop, and shopping in Chinatown), but I wanted to try it at least once.At the time of writing this review, the base price for a large deep dish is around $18 with no toppings, and then about $2.50 for each additional topping. When it comes to pizza, I like to have many toppings, so I got pepperoni, sausage, Canadian bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. I shared the pizza with 3 other people.I felt that for my appetite, I should have shared the pizza with 4 others instead of 3. The pizza is very thick and filled with toppings. I only managed to eat a single slice - though I did have one piece of garlic cheese bread before that (fairly standard as far as that flavor went). The pizza was perfect deep dish - the crust was crunchy, the cheese was layered and thick, and the toppings all blended together nicely.One of the downsides of deep dish, I feel, is that it's not nearly as good when delivered, because of how thick the pizza is. The pizza gets soggy quickly, and towards the end of the meal I already started to feel the cheese start to be more solid and not as tasty. The trade off is that deep dish, when eaten fresh, is incredibly rich and full of flavors.There are different schools of thought as to whether or not deep dish is ""real pizza"" - some say that pizzas are meant to be more flat and meant to be a nice balance of 50% crust and 50% toppings, whereas others would say pizza is pizza as long as the ingredients are there. Regardless of the case, I do feel deep dish is an incredibly unique way to experience pizza, and it is honestly my preferred way of eating pizza. Pequod's ranks easily as the best deep dish I've had yet, and may be one of the best pizzas I've ever had.",12,3,positive

We walked past her and immediately 2 seats opened up at the bar, we sat down and ordered right away. Pro tip - always look for bar seats! The pizza was a little disappointing this time around. We got a medium deep dish, half cheese half sausage. The sauce was more tomato-y than I remember, and the pizza seemed a little underdone. Maybe it was just an off night.

If you come here on the weekend or in the evening, expect a bit of a wait. And the pizza themselves take pretty long to cook too. But they did have the great idea to open up a cocktail/beer place next door called Whale Tail, so you can booze up a bit while you wait for your table. The only downside is sometimes the pizza can be hit or miss. There's days where it is bland, which I know is crazy to say after proclaiming it to be my favorite pizza spot. But when they hit the mark, it's the best the city has to offer. A good tip is to bring some home and eat it the next day for leftovers after pooping in the oven a bit (no microwave nonsense). It's even better the day after. The staff is also really nice. From the friendly waitresses' to the older gentlemen (with the great head of hair) who is always working the host stand.",11,4,positive

We arrived, and were informed that our reservation had been canceled without being notified, and that there was nothing that they would do. No apology, no attempt to accommodate, just too bad for for us. Quite a way to treat customers. There are lots of good deep dish places in Chicago. Avoid this one.",1,1,negative
651,"I was picked up by my Lyft driver, Antoinette, heading to Gino's East but when I asked her where the best pizza in town is, she drove me to Pequod's. It was close to 9pm and a line out the door so you know it's probably good! Fortunately for me, there was a seat at the bar. They had a great beer and drink selection, which is good because you may have a couple before your pizza comes out. It took about 45 min for my pizza to be served, and it was totally worth the wait! Absolutely the best Chicago style pizza I've ever had , hands down! Cannot wait to come back.",6,0,positive
652,"Pequod's Pizza, one of the most famous destinations for deep dish or as they call it, pan pizza in the city most famous for it is a destination worthy of a dedicated visit.. A dive bar atmosphere pervades, but it manages not to feel seedy or gross. The inside is deceptively massive with multiple floors and rooms, so even though it gets packed, the wait time is only occasionally prolonged. The longer wait is for the pizza to actually be cooked, but we end up only waiting maybe 20 minutes even though we're told it will be 40.  There's even beer available from some of the local craft breweries and not just the big domestics as you'd expect at a dive. The deep dish is succulent and doughy. Each slice requires diving in and indulging in a monstrous bite. I love a good pepperoni and this pan pizza has a good pepperoni.",8,3,positive
653,"Of course I had to stop by a deep dish pizza joint when in Chicago! We came around 10pm on a Fri night and waited around 20min. Our server told us that it would take around 45 min for the pizza to cook but ours came out in about 30min. We got a small 10"" pizza with Italian beef, onion, and spinach. This was the perfect size for two people because it gave each of us two huge pieces that really made us so full!! I mean, unbuckle your belt full..I loved the crispy crust and red sauce. The cheese was super gooey that when we took our first bite, it was all stringy! All in all, it was a great deep dish pizza. It didn't blow my mind but it left me feeling satisfied!",5,1,positive
654,"This place is much better than Giordano's, but doesn't beat Lou Malnati's. However, the crust at Pequod's is very unique. I'd come here just to try the crust. It's very chewy and has a slightly sweet flavor.",2,0,positive
655,"I have been a fan of Pequod's since the mid 1990's.  I've dined at their Morton Grove, IL location as well.  Great pan pizza...perhaps the best if your seeking a non-traditional stuffed or deep dish crust.  The fluffy, caramelized pan pizza crust gives this pizza an additional feature which practically has you licking your plate.  Excellent ingredients, well prepared pizza, plenty of appetizer options makes for an enjoyable pizza dining experience.",4,0,positive

657,I don't understand this as a number one Chicago pizza. For me it falls flat. The caramelized crust isn't enough to keep me coming back. The pizza is more bread like than anything else. It's as if they substitute out a pizza dough for a loaf of bread. The ratio of dough to sauce to cheese just doesn't do it for me. There is way better pizza in Chicago for me pequod's doesn't even make my top 5,4,1,negative
658,"Disappointed.  Flew into Chicago and 1st stop was Pequod's Pizzeria.  We were seated right away on Tuesday for lunch.  However we had to wait 5-10 minutes for waiter to come take our food and drink order.  We ordered the pan cheese pizza and a thin crust pizza with pineapple, mushroom and onions, a salad and french fries.   Salad and French fries came out first.  French fries were good however there was a dead fly in our salad.  We lost our appetite for salad.  So we just told them to take it away.  Pan pizza can out and it was underwhelming.  Tasted a bit dry.  However the thin crust pizza was laden with cheese and toppings.  It was very good.  I would recommend the thin crust over the pan pizza.  We had to wait another 10 minutes to get a waiter to give us the check and another 10 minutes for them to come back to process the payment. I heard a lot of great things about this place but next time I think I'll just order to go.  Service was slow and they didn't seem apologetic about finding a dead fly in our salad.  Disappointed in service and food.",5,3,negative

The first time, after waiting for three hours and receiving no pizza, I called to check on it and they said they had lost my order and that they could reorder and deliver in two hours. The second time, after waiting for two hours, the order showed up completely wrong - the ticket itself was correct, but the pizza was not at all what I ordered. I called and without missing a beat (this must happen all the time) they said they could either remake the pizza and deliver in two hours (seriously??) or give me a credit, but I couldn't have my money back. I honestly love this place and have been going for years, but the last time I ever eat there will be for free when I use that credit.",3,1,negative

You never know you might find out if their pizza is for you.",5,0,positive
662,"Ordered from here on a Saturday night and took about an hour 1/2 for the food to be delivered. We decided to go wild and ordered mozzarella sticks, onion rings, spinach thin crust pizza, pepperoni and sausage pan pizza, carrot cake and red velvet cake. * Mozzarella Sticks - cheesy goodness and the marinara sauce that came with it has extra tasty. Not sure if they put cheese or something else in sauce, but it was delicious. (5 stars) * Onion Rings - crispy and crunchy. They come with BBQ sauce which made them even better (4 stars).* Spinach Thin Crust Pizza - the sauce was bland city. I wouldn't get this again. (1 star) * Pepperoni and Sausage Pan Pizza - so meaty, great amount of sauce and nice crispy crust. They give you nice chunks of sausage, which have a sweet taste to them. I recommend ordering this pizza with these toppings. (4.5 stars)* Carrot Cake - was good, but the slice was super small for the $5.95 price they charged (3.5 stars)* Red Velvet Cake - my friend said it had a pizza taste to it (this was said after he brushed his teeth) and was the worst red velvet he ever had (1 star).All and all if you going to order/dine at Pequod's I recommend sticking to the appetizers and pan pizza.",11,4,negative
663,"Overrated in my opinion.  If you like a lot of baked bread this is definitely the place for you.  Not sure how this place got so hot but it's not worth the wait and there are so many good pizza options that you shouldn't let yourself get caught up in the hype.  Saving grace is the burnt crust, I actually like that.",6,1,negative
664,Two stars because I found a hair in my salad. The pizza was good; first time having deep dish in Chicago and I was pleased. We ordered the medium size to share between 3 people and there was leftovers. We had half pepperoni and half pepperoni and meatball. The crust was nice and crispy and there was an ample amount of toppings. Definitely a fun place with friends or chill date.,5,1,negative
665,"Came here tonight with some friends, I've had Chicago deep dish and was expecting that in my head, however, it was different than the other deep dish I've experienced since it was ""pan"" pizza. I personally enjoyed this better than the typical deep dish. We got pepperoni and meatball, it was delicious. We had a Pequod's salad and French fries to start, the fries were seasoned with a really good flavor. The dressing on the salad was amazing.

667,"Now this is what I came to Chicago for...some DELICIOUS deep dish pizza!! It's a telling sign when multiple people I know in Chicago tell me that Pequod's is their favorite pizza joint. We came here for lunch and there was still about a 30-45 minute wait. I like how Pequod's isn't a chain (compared to Lou's) and it has a much more homey vibe to it. It's a great pizza pub. It's not located in the downtown area, but it's a definite must if you're visiting Chicago. The trek out is worth it.My buddy and I split a small pizza. They don't have pre-set pizzas on the menu; they really encourage customization. We settled on the cheese only with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and onion. Talk about out-of-this-world pizza!!! I'm a huge fan of deep-dish and to get an authentic taste of Chicago deep-dish pizza was amazing. Everything, from the crust to the toppings, was delicious. I love how the crust is caramelized and I loved the thickness of the pan pizza. Not to mention, the sausages were huge!! Let's just say that each bite was magical.The wait once you're seated can be a while because they make each pizza to order. It might be a good idea for them to take your order while you're waiting to be seated in order to speed up the process. In any case, the wait is definitely worth it and it's probably one of the best deep dish pizzas I've had. I can't wait to go back when I'm in town!",13,1,positive
668,I LOVE THIS DEEP DISH PIZZA. I've lived in Chicago for a bit now and tried a lot of different deep dishes and this is the best. I am also newly vegan and got it without cheese with all the veggies. It was delicious. Def recommend this place to anyone who wants good pizza!,4,0,positive
669,"I love a good crust so I was super excited to try deep dish in Chicago. Pequod's is away from the center of Chicago but it was still packed. Luckily, we had made ""reservations"" (not real reservations, just cuts your wait time down). We were still seated right away, but were told the pizza would take 45 minutes. Bummer. We started with an order of wings which were nothing special. There's a few sizes you can choose from and you can pay for additional toppings. I chose spinach and fresh garlic. 45 minutes later our pizzas came out piping hot in a cast iron skillet allowing for a crispy, thick crust. Pequod's had more of a sports bar feel, which I did not expect. Overall a solid spot for deep dish.",8,0,positive
670,"Generally, I'm a pretty calm individual. Unless it comes to pizza. I will literally fight anyone who bad mouths Chicago style pizza. (Why are there so many people who hate on the deep dish?! It's a lot of people I have to fight!) So when I got the opportunity to visit Chicago, and got the opportunity to try authentic deep dish, I was in a pizza-induced haze for the weeks leading up to the trip.My boyfriend's brother lives in Chicago, and recommended Pequod's as a place the locals eat at. Now, I don't know how accurate that statement is, especially since I'm not a local, but it was crowded nonetheless! Very crowded. As a party of 4, it took a little while to get seated, but not long at all to be a bother. (I've had longer waits at an Olive Garden.)We ordered two pizzas, with a multitude of toppings, and waited. Both my boyfriend's brother and the waitress warned that it was going to be a while, so I got a salad also. It was delicious, and helped pass the time while I waited for the magnificence that is Chicago deep dish. And when it came, delivered piping hot to the table, I swear I almost fainted.I wish I got pictures, because it was literally one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. Much like one of the wonders of the world, it'll take your breath away. Don't even talk to me about my first bite. It's just a void in my memory because as soon as I put a bite in my mouth, I ascended to a different plane of existence. When I came back down, I can remember the bubbly, gooey cheese, and the flavorful robust sauce, and the crunchy, caramelized crust. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now...Oh, how I wish I could go back! The pizza was so good! The service was fantastic, too. And the price, for the literal pounds of food you're getting, is very worth it. And the interior is very cozy and very homey. One of my favorite parts of Chicago, for sure!",19,7,positive

673,"Be warned on the weekends they don't take orders ahead of time. Pizza takes 75 minutes not 50, we ordered a medium.

I called before to make a reservation, hostess said no it's not necessary for two people, I'll put you on the priority list. Got there, your on priority list, it will be 20 minutes, was 40 minutes.

Pequod is located outside of downtown Chicago, so I made it a mission to try it during my short stay! The pizza price would be based off of number of toppings. As suggested by our waitress, we got a medium for a party of three. We were worried that 8 slices were three was not enough, but after eating, we were glad we listened. As shown in my pictures, the pizza has a lot of breading. A lot of reviews complained stating it's not deep dish, which is true. The menu clearly says pan- hence all the breading. My only complaint is that it does take 25-30 minutes to make each pizza, so be prepared to wait!",3,4,positive

682,"Wow 5 Stars without a doubt for Pequods delicious deep dish pizza! Known as the newest favorite pizza and deep dish in Chicago. Many locals and especially tourists are more familiar with the popular pizza Chicago brand names such as Lou Malnatis, Giordanos and Uno but there is a new favorite in town in Pequods. Loaded with toppings, surrounded by a crispy and cheesy yet light and airy crust, Pequods delivers a unique approach to the ever traditional deep dish in Chicago.Located in Lincoln Park, Pequods is a tiny restaurant pumping out a lot of ZA! With a tremendous following, Pequods is a favorite to a lot of people in Chicago. I have never tried the thin crust but a lot of people swear by it.. I enjoy a crispy thin crust but when I'm going here there is no doubt I am getting the loaded pepperoni deep dish. It is an incredible pizza and will leave you in a serious food coma.",7,3,positive

684,"Be prepared to wait for this Chicago classic. I came around 5:30 pm and ended up not getting a pizza until 8pm! Plan accordingly guys! I think you can take the food to go as well but we dined in so it took a bit longer. We ordered a large pizza (for 3 girls) with a variety of toppings and extra cheese. We also got a cheesy garlic bread appetizer. The appetizer was ok. It's just bread with a lot of cheese. I was starving so I thought it tasted good but it was pretty generic. They were also super skimpy with the marinara sauce. Our pizza was super cheesy. I don't know why we got extra cheese! Deep regrets. It has enough cheese. The toppings add up so choose wisely. Our pizza ended up being ~$45 total (from a base price of $18). Each slice weighed like 5 lbs. That's a lot of food. The vegetables are really fresh and the premium meats very good. You can't go wrong with your favorites.Service is good, albeit slow because of its popularity. The space is cramped and dark but I think that is the genera design of these pizza places. I will probably not go back because I don't like this kind of food plus the wait was no fun. But when in Chicago - you must eat deep dish and Pequods is a great place to go get some.",16,8,negative
685,"Can we talk about lunch specials?  So many times a lunch special does not feel special, but Pequod's does!  Monday - Friday you can get in on a smoking deal!  $4.95 for their personal pizza and a fountain drink is ridiculous (in the best way possible).  Now be aware that is just for a cheese pizza but you can start piling on the toppings for $0.80 each to customize that pie.  I put Giardinera on mine and was repping like a true Chicagoan.  I opted for a lemonade as my soft drink and since it was a weekday off I did choose to them buy myself a beer because pizza and beer, hell ya!   Had some 2 Brothers on draft and was loving my local lunch.  The pie was more a a deep dish style and the cheese had some nice caramelization around all of the edges. Do not be fooled it is not burnt!  Perfect sized meal for lunch but they do make things to order so it will not be a quick meal if you have somewhere to go.",5,3,positive

687,"Disclaimer: I'm a native New Yorker. So I'm temporarily expanding my definition of pizza to include the Italian Pot Pies that Chicago inexplicably calls pizza. Is Pequod's the best pizza in Chicago? I mean, it's better than Unos and Giordano's and Malnati's. But is it the best pizza in Chicago?The first time I went I braved the wait and got the small with sausage. I like the classics. I thought it lacked some serious umami and it gave it a kind of bready flavor. On the other hand, I was a fan of the carmelization and could see the potential in it. Still, the hype persisted, so a few years later I gave it another try. I liked it a lot more the second time around. I got it with the sausage and the fresh garlic,  which has become my go-to for deep dish. The garlic provides the punch that was missing the first time, and it was a much better experience. So it Pequod's the best pizza in the city?My favorite pizza (in Chicago) remains Coalfire, which isn't deep dish and therefore is an actual pizza. And, well, please refer to my disclaimer at the top. I'm probably in the minority here, but my favorite deep dish remains My Pi in Bucktown. There is an additional punch of flavor it gives you that Pequod's hasn't quite been able to match. I love Pequod's crust game,  but everything else falls just a little short by comparison. Despite that, unlike the Au Cheval burger debacle that I will vociferously go to war over, I wouldn't object to anybody saying Pequod's is the best...deep dish...pizza.",14,4,positive

The pizza had just the right amount of sauce and was done perfectly. When I arrived there was no wait and I just sat at the bar. The service was attentive as he always kept my drink fresh.

The wings were okay and looked like they came from a food deprived chicken. The pizza is massive and has this nice charred crust but I've come to the realization that I'm just not a deep dish fan. The toppings were fantastic but the pizza just lacks the amount of cheese and sauce that I like. It feels like you are eating a salad of toppings with some crust on the side.

But I prefer the cheese to be a component in my deep dish (because otherwise, I might as well have a lasagna, right?) The two of us split a medium with garlic, onion, and basil on top.

I ended up ordering to-go because it was already pretty late on a Friday night and there isn't a huge abundance of seating in the restaurant. Long wait aside, this is some quality pan pizza and after trying Lou Manalti's as well, I can say Pequod's is definitely the superior pizza. Ordered the large (14 inch) pan pizza, with pepperoni, mushroom, olive, and sausage. All the ingredients were fresh. Pizza wasn't too oily. Mozzarella was stringy. And sauce had good tart zing. On my second slice, I realized they do use a lot of crust on the bottom, but when you're eating it you don't really notice.  The caramelized crust is crack. Single-handedly the best pizza crust I've ever had. Bottom line: great quality deep-dish pizza.",9,1,positive
712,Ok so I've heard through word of mouth and reading online this one of the go-to places for deep dish in Chicago. Granted we ordered delivery I would give this place another try in store. The woman taking our order was not great had to repeat everything several times and she just didn't have a lot of common sense so ordering was a bit of a headache. When it got here (restaurant is less than 3 miles from hotel) it was barely hot and sorely lacking sauce. The salad was good and the toppings on the pizza were good. Overall don't do delivery!,4,2,negative
713,Favorite deep dish pizza. I'm not a huge deep dish fan but if I had to choose it would be pequods. Show up early or show up after the rush. The pizza takes a while so be prepared to wait.,0,0,positive
714,"Delicious!  We had a table of 11. We had reservations at 5 and were seated immediately.  Our waitress advised us to put our pizza order in right away as they take 40 minutes or more. We had two deep dish, one spinach and mushroom and another with sausage, peppers and pepperoni.  We also had a flat pizza half cheese and half pepperoni.  My nephew is on a special gluten free diet and the manager took the time to discuss options and they settled on sausage that they would cook especially for him.Service was excellent!  We have had many deep dish pizzas in Chicago and think this is the best we've had.  I highly recommended this place!",5,0,positive
715,The crust was amazing!!!! If you want a savory pizza go with the Hawaiian pizza! If you are feeling bold do a split between that and maybe pepperoni and mushroom a large (14' works perfect for 3 people)! The wait was worth it!,4,1,positive
716,"Ehh not the best, I'm a local and love deep dish pizza once in a while...okay maybe three times a year because that stuff is heavy! But I wasn't a fan of the burnt crust that makes this place so popular. Which is fine because you will either love it or hate it. It's just not my cup of tea. The service was great though, they did forget a topping but were nice enough to deduct the cost of the topping and then some for the inconvenience.",8,2,negative
717,"No matter what they tell you when you call in to make a reservation just know that these guys DO NOT take reservations! The lack of professionalism, and being packed in like a sardine, is not worth the wait for this pizza. Go to Lou's instead!",2,0,negative
718,I see it advertised on Chicago's Best and everyone says how great it is.  I was at an Air bnb and decided to order.  I'm sorry but it was just ok... the sauce was bland.  Maybe it's me?I will try them again.  The delivery was fast.,2,2,negative
719,"First of all don't be fooled by the pictures the topping is only two or three small slices of meet or whatever you ask for .      I had one of the worst experiences ever with one of the managers when I told them what's wrong with my pizza she said in order to fix it it'll take about 45 minuets just like what it took us to wait for it when we had to wait an hour to be seated and another 45 minuets to get the pizza. Or she will take care of it and since we waited enough we agreed that they'll take care of it, unfortunately when it was time to get the check we found that she took care of the topping that it was missing only which was the protein topped and no way I'll have a pizza with only cheese. After a long argument about what they mean by we'll take care of it they agreed to take of another topping I paid just to be done and leave it was absolutely not professional from her. Trust me It's an overrated place if I didn't have this experience to be fair I'll give them 3 stars",3,4,negative
720,"After reading the reviews for a few different pizza places, my boyfriend and I decided to check out Pequod's while in town last night. We got there around 5:15 on a Thursday and were seated right away on the second floor where it is much calmer and quieter. When we left an hour and a half later, the place was packed and the downstairs was very noisy. So yes, get there early if you don't want to wait! We ordered two appetizers to hold us over while the pizza was cooking: jalapeño poppers for him ($7) and half order of hot wings for me ($5). My wings were very good- spicy and plenty of meat on them. Plus they give the option of ranch or blue cheese which was nice and also novel for me because at many upstate ny places it's blue cheese or nothin' and I'm not a fan. I'm not sure how long the pizza took but it didn't seem long at all because it came out very soon after we finished with the appetizers... perfect timing! We got a 10"" deep dish pizza with pepperoni and black olives (~$15). My boyfriend wasn't sure about getting the small pizza to split for fear of not having enough, but it was plenty! We actually each could only eat about one and a half slices- and there were four all together. The pie itself was very tasty. Crunchy and chewy crust, lots of toppings, tangy sauce and I actually really liked the toasty burnt cheese ring around the crust which is their specialty. I realized that deep dish is not my favorite--- I'm a thin crust girl at heart! But I'm glad I gave it a shot and I don't think there's a better place than Pequod's to do it.",10,2,positive
721,"Ordered takeout on a Sunday and was told it would take 50 minutes. When I arrived, it took them 10 minutes to figure out and tell me that they had forgotten to make my pizza. Given that it is deep dish, it would be another 50 minute wait to get my pizza. They told me they would comp. the pizza (I still had to pay the tax which was weird) and deliver it free of charge. However, when it arrived, they charged me a $2.75 delivery fee. On top of it all, the pizza was way too doughy compared to other times I've had pequods and it seemed like they skimped on the toppings. Only giving them above 1 star because the carmalized crust is good, but not good enough that I'll be coming back after this poor service",6,1,negative
722,"Now THIS is the deep dish pizza that we had heard so much about when planning our trip to Chicago. Be ready to wait a long time (over an hour after being seated), but an attentive waitress kept our sodas refilled and we had great conversation while waiting. And, the pizza was worth the wait. This truly felt like a neighborhood spot where you come for the good food and friendly service.",7,0,positive
723,"Worst customer service. Pizzas great but management is lacking basic customer service. Long story short, I don't care how good the pizza is after my experience with management. I know my experience is a daily occurrence & the owners should be aware they're losing customers & profit due to their inability to hire employees who have common sense.",2,1,negative
724,"I went here on a trip based on the recommendation of a Chicago native. The pizza was incredible -- especially the burnt cheese edges. If you're in the area, it's well worth it. Very casual, noisy sports bar vibe and be prepared to wait around 40min after you order. I enjoyed it, though I'd probably do take out if I went again.",5,0,positive
725,"If you like a loud, bustling place where you don't mind long wait times, plastic drinking glasses, and difficult-to-find parking, you might like it here. But if you're hungry you might be hangry by the time you get your pie. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is terrific, but with all the wonderful pizza places in Chicago I won't go out of my way to go here.By boyfriend, on the other hand, loves this place. He likes the bustle, loves the pizza, and doesn't mind driving around for 15 minutes to find parking and then another 30 minutes or more to get seated and then another 30 minutes  for pizza.",7,1,negative
726,Fantastic.   Came here with the family.  Travelled from Houston and were told to visit Pequod's.   Holy Cow.  Get the deep dish pizza.   Delicious and filling.   Enjoy.,0,0,positive
727,Favorite burnt style crust in Chicagoland area. Way different than what you're used to. The individual pizzas are the way to go. Whenever i go bigger the pizza seem more dry and lacks sauce. So if you go big ask for a xtra sauce so you won't be disappointed with a hockey puck arriving to your table.,0,1,positive
728,"This is a constant debate between friends who love it and friends who don't think it's great. I personally am a fan. It does have a lot of crush which might turn some people away, but that's what I like. I got spinach deep dish and would highly recommend.",4,1,positive
729,If you ask me deep dish or thin crust I choose thin crust every day. But as far as deep dish in Chicago Pequods really does it right. Everyone I bring here from out of town falls in love. The crust is delicious here - definitely unique to pequods. Best time to come is when they open so you get seated right away. Order some apps - but stay hungry. I've only ever been able to eat 1 generous slice of deep dish. But it's been well worth it. Leftovers ain't too bad either!,7,2,positive

732,"I've gotta say that I definitely like Pequod's better than Lou's!! I've been to Chicago twice now and have tried both places during both visits. Pequod's definitely takes the cake on this! ...or should I say pizza? Hehehe. They do a pan pizza, so I guess it's not the traditional deep dish in a sense but it's still my favorite in Chicago! And they give generous portions of pepperoni! Every bite literally had at least 3 slices of pepperoni in it. It takes about 40 min for their pizzas once you place the order so we called ahead and just did take out! The middle ended up being a tad bit soggy but it was still all good to me. It's more of a bar vibe in there so it's a great place for big groups. Definitely a must visit when coming to Chicago!",6,0,positive
733,"The service was terrible at a peak time- it took so long to place our order that by the time we left we'd been there over two hours.  We came with a family of 8, ordered two pizzas.  One was under cooked and the other was perfection.  For the cost and wait, I expect near perfection and better service. UPDATE: shortly after posting we got outreach, which is meaningful and show they care.  I'd try again, but perhaps purposely come at a less busy time.",4,1,negative
734,"AWESOME deep dish pizza!! Much better than both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. I don't know why it's taken me so long to try this place out! I suppose the other two aforementioned pizzerias are more famous to non-native individuals roaming about Chicago for some deep dish delight (such as myself) because they are established chains and have quite a few locations on the map. However, Pequod's blows either of those other two out of the water!My friend and I were seated in the adjacent Whale's Tale in order to be served faster, but we were assured that the pizza we would be getting was produced by Pequod's. Additionally they told us that we would only be able to order the appetizers available at Whale's Tale as well, and not from Pequod's, which wasn't an issue for us as we didn't get any appetizers. I'm not sure exactly how the relationship between the two establishments functions, but it worked out to our benefit as we were seated immediately, were able to place our orders as quickly as possible, and were served the pizza in only 25 or so minutes. I believe that the maître d' said they actually served the pizza at Whale's Tale even more quickly than if we had placed our order seated in Pequod's, which I also don't understand.Small 10"" Pan Pizza w/ pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and green pepper -  My friend and I initially wanted to overload the pizza with all the toppings, but the waitress serving us mentioned that having too many could cause the pizza to undercook, and so we only got got these four toppings, which I am super glad we did now in retrospect. I LOVE the ""carmelized"" crust on their deep dish, which is essentially just some slightly burnt cheese. It adds a nice crunchiness to the crust and actually doesn't have too much of that acrid flavor associated with burnt cheese - it does have a small amount of it, but just the right amount. The bread was so soft and fluffy - I was surprised how much bread there actually was in each bite. Initially I thought there was too much, but as I kept on eating I began to enjoy the fact that there was so much of it. It really helped to hold each bite together, and there was so much flavor in the toppings, sauce, and cheese, that I didn't feel like the bread was excessively drowning out and diluting the flavor of any of the other components in the pizza. Again awesome AWESOME deep dish.Overall an amazing deep dish experience. As a Californian, I've always heard about the wonders of deep dish pizza in Chicago, and up until now I've always been slightly disappointed. Pequod's is amazing and has definitely set the bar for me for deep dish pizza! If you've never tried deep dish before in Chicago, I would definitely DEFINITELY recommend passing over Lou Malnati's or Giordano's and trying this place out instead, especially if you only have time to try one place. Unmistakably the best deep dish in Chicago that I've tried so far!",22,4,positive
735,"**This rating is based on Chicago pizza joints. Pequod's would score a higher rating when compared with pizza in Austin, TX for example.I feel that most every Chicagoan has their favorite when it comes to pizza. For me, growing up, it was Giordano's. While Gio's is still a classic, a few years ago my favorite switched to Lou Malnati's which I only tolerated as a kid funny enough (not all locations are created equal, the Lincoln Park location is one of the best). I've heard rumblings over the past few years that Pequod's was not to be missed. My brother had heard the same and we finally tried them out.The atmosphere has a pretty standard sports bar/pizza place vibe that works. A Euro Cup match was being played while we ate which was nice. Now for the pizzas. First, I would say don't even mess with their thin crust. We tried a slice just to test it out and to me, it was on level with microwavable pizza in terms of flavor and texture. Their pan pizza is definitely an upgrade. We got a large with sausage, mushrooms, and fresh basil. As a whole, I'd say it was good, but no new craving has been created and now I feel the need to go to get my Lou Malnati's on before heading out of town.I will say that their sausage and burnt crust were the two clear highlights and the bottom of their crust was crispy throughout. They were not cheap with toppings either as they piled them on. Also, there was a guy there who I'm guessing is either the owner or the GM and he was really really nice and you could tell he had genuine care for his patrons. They do a solid pan pizza here that is worth checking out.P.S. Always always always avoid ordering a personal pizza at any Chicago deep dish place. It's no where near as good as any medium and above sized pie.",16,2,negative
736,"This is my favorite deep dish in a city known for deep dish pizzas. Great crust, quality toppings, but what puts it over the top is the crisped up cheese on the crust---so good. They own a bar next door if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table",3,0,positive
737,"I don't get deep dish pizza. We waited over 2 hours on a Saturday to get some pizza from Pequod's. The space is cozy, but has 2 floors. Our waitress was friendly enough, and our appetizer of jalapeno poppers came out quickly enough, but we had to wait another 45 minutes for our pizza. (a wait we already knew about). The pizza itself was a deep pool of tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings. Basically impossible to eat with your hands, which led me to use a fork and knife. It was pretty tasty, but not really much of a pizza. And honestly, I prefer the chain deep dish pizza, Uno's, because the crust is much more buttery. It was good, but definitely not worth waiting close to 3 hours.",9,1,negative
738,"Great pizza! To me, the ratios of dough, sauce and toppings is just right . It takes awhile to get your pizza but they let you know that before you sit down. I recommend coming early instead of during the dinner rush as your wait will be way longer !",2,0,positive
739,"Pequod's was my first crack at authentic Chicago style pizza in Chicago. In fact, it was the very first stop we made upon arrival into the Windy City and it certainly did not disappoint. Their specialty is the ""caramelized crust"" edge on their pan style pizzas. The cheese was oozing out onto the side of crust and it was full of cheesy goodness. This is how they differentiate themselves from the competition and they execute it very well. We got a large sausage and pepperoni deep dish which was essentially a meat lovers pizza. Each bite was bursting of flavor and left us completely stuffed at the end. The only issue I had was that it was too crusty for my liking. I prefer a traditional deep dish that's not as doughy but that's just a matter of preference. The ingredients here were fresh, they don't used canned tomatoes which is splendid. As with all authentic Chicago style pizzas, the waiting time will be long since they have to bake the crust to a nice golden brown.  Getting the buffalo wings as appetizers in the meantime is a solid move. They were delicious and it certainly made the wait for the pizza more bearable by chowing down some delicious wings. They have a good selection of craft beers too which is nice. As a few people in our group were San Diegans, we had to go with a pitcher of our beloved Ballast Point Sculpin. Service was friendly and efficient as well. We were there until past closing at 2am and they did not rush to kick us out. They provided prompt and courteous service even though we were literally the last customers of the night. Overall, Pequod's definitely earns their reputation as being one of the finest deep dish pizzerias in Chicago. Although I prefer Lou Manati's, I am not at all surprised that many people have Pequod's ranked as the king of Chicago deep dish.",24,3,positive

742,"I almost gave this a four-star review after my last couple times coming here.  It is over run with kids now and almost unbearable to eat at the bar, but the pizza here is the best deep dish I have ever eaten.  By the way, I am fat as fuck and eat a lot of pizza.  I've tried a lot of places but this one has been my favorite for the 18 years I've lived here.  Also, as much as I do bitch about it being over crowded with 12 to 21 year old meat puppets the service has always been up to the task in fixing any fuck ups on your order.   We use to call in our pizza a head of time and eat it there.  Worked like a charm for years walking into the place and the Za is on the table 5 mins after sitting down.   Don't try that now as it's a nightmare and you will be disappointed.   We recently tried this and sat there for over an hour waiting for a pizza we called in 30 mins prior.  When it finally came out the shit was fucking cold.  Another waitress/manager saw the look on our faces and stuck it back in the oven.  After 5 mins in the oven it was fucking delicious. On top of it she didn't charge us a dime for anything.I know this doesn't read like a 5 start review but honestly the pizza is that good, - just take it home.",8,12,positive

But the pizza was fantastic. It's not quite true Chicago deep dish- the crust is pretty thick- but we still loved it. I'm holding back on 5 stars because service was a little chaotic. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen most of the time, and it took a while to get our waters.",6,1,positive

First impression I think it is fairly ranked depending on what you prefer.  PROS: - The sauce is really good and nice an peppery.- That ring on the outside is not burnt crust it's actually burnt cheese and they do that on purpose and it's amazing.CONS: - Not much cheese in the cheese layer below the sauce which surprised meAll in all it wasn't my favorite, just because I prefer a cheesier pie - but still very good. Probably rank it as a tie for second with Giordanos but for different reasons.",7,0,positive

We ended up finding a bar seat.  The wait for pizza was advertised at 50 minutes but ours arrived after about 35 minutes.  In the meantime we ordered a Peqoud Salad (half size), which was more than enough for 2. Also ordered a tasty 3 floyds beer. Only 4 tap selections, but at least a couple were craft. The pizza was excellent. It had melted cheese on the side edge that was a little burnt and tasty. We also got meatballs and spinach on it. Both great options.",5,0,positive

752,"Very tasty pizza but for that price i would like to see more cheese. It's mostly bread and sauce. I believe their sauce and the way the cook it well done is the key. Maybe next time I go I will order extra cheese if they allow it. Therefore beware cheese lovers there is a paper thin layer of cheese on this pizza and the only way they can get away with this is because of how they caramelize the little cheese that is on there which amplifies the flavor.Also be prepared to for a possible long wait during busy hours, the restaurant is not very big.",2,1,positive
753,"Recommended to me by numerous people before my trip to Chicago, and most definitely praised by locals while I was here, I was on a mission to get to Pequod's. Seriously, this girl in an UberPool we were with was talking about the usual big dogs of deep dish since we said we were from out of town, but the moment I brought up Pequod's, she yelped (haha) like there were ants down her pants.It was a group of 5 of us, so we got the large (14"") pie with pepperoni and sausage. We each had a couple of drinks so one slice was definitely enough, and two would bring you over the top. I had two :)While I still prefer the classic New York slice, I can definitely get behind the deep dish from here. The crunchiness of the crust is what sealed the deal, balancing out the gooeyness of the cheese, and the tasty (and not too salty) pepperoni and sausage. It truly tasted like they used some top notch ingredients and put a lot of love into their pies. To sum it up, there's no beating their meat! Might be fine in the back alley, though...",9,0,positive

We went on the website and requested a table for 2 at 4:30 p.m. about a week prior. When we got there we were immediately seated. I highly suggest you do that, the website claims it cuts the wait time in half. I know this place is always crowded so I was super happy when we were seated right away. We probably picked an early enough time. The place was pretty packed.When we were seated we ordered our pizza immediately (since the wait for a pizza can be up to 2 hours - ours was 2.5 hours). We also ordered fries and mozzarella sticks as apps, good choice because we were STARVING and smelling pizza and seeing people eat around you was not helping the wait. Oh boy I just wanted my pizza lol. We were told to order extra sauce, and thank the lord we listened to that kind gentleman because when our pizza came out it was AMAZING. We got a medium, extra sauce and pepperoni. I seriously am craving this pizza as I'm typing this it is that good. Any and every time I am in Chicago I will go to pequods.

758,"Don't get it, not sure what all the fuss is about. Somewhat average pizza, maybe its' popularity is because of its' past reputation. Tried a large tomato cheese pizza and also a pepperoni and vegetable pizza. Both were the same, lots of dough, some tomato sauce and some cheese. Not sure what all the raving is about since the dough is not very tasty. Actually the best part of the dough were the ends that touch the pan which were burnt with cheese. However overall, it was a very bready pizza. Along with that we had the Caesar salad which again was average at best.For dessert we had a brownie again average at best, it was very cakey and dry.  Being a tourist, I was very disappointed, as I expected much more. In fact I've tried a deep dish from the Uno's chain and found it to be superior. I guess I've been there, and done that, but not worth a return visit.  Sorry to lambaste a Chicago institution but I honestly was expecting a lot more.",5,3,negative

760,"Trust in the crust, not in the service.Pequod's is considered by many (the vivacious LeAnn P among them) to serve one of Chicago's best pizzas, and after a visit this past weekend I can believe the hype.It takes either a very special pie or a very special lady to get me to eat deep dish (as I much prefer thin crust); in this case it was a little bit of both.  Fortunately we came early enough in the evening before great masses crowded the place, so getting a table was no problemo.Knowing that their Chicago-style was legendary (3,000 reviews on Yelp, god damn!), we hastily asked for a 10"" pan with pepperoni, sausage, and green peppers.  Pequod's is famous for their burnt cheese crust, which comes out black and delicious (much like Drake).Thirty minutes seems like an eternity when you're craving the 'za, but eventually it arrived and we dug in with little hesitation.  Great sauce, plentiful toppings, and a blackened cheesy pan crust had me singing their praises.  It was incredible, folks.  I'd say my expectations were high and even they got surpassed.  I still feel weird eating pizza with a knife and fork, but when it's as good as Pequod's I could honestly care less.Bread = 4.5Circuses = 2.5The 'za was as good as the service was bad.  But in what way?Our server Alex greeted us, got in our pizza order and brought us drinks, after which she pretty much vanished.  When our deep dish finally arrived, a different girl brought it out and sliced it for us, who later also brought us more refreshments......so where did Alex go?  Maybe she quit.  Perhaps a family emergency?  Noooooope!  Turns out, she was just chillin' at the bar, hobnobbing with some locals while enjoying a glass of wine and a slice.  Apparently, her shift had ended.  Areyouf*ckingkiddingme?I had no words.  None to describe how flabbergasted I was that our original waitress totally bailed on us without warning.  A quick ""hey, I'm closing out, (new waitress) will be taking over for me"", would have sufficed but we didn't even get that much.  When the check came, I wanted to confirm that Alex wouldn't get diddly squat tip-wise for abandoning her customers, but as the server was listed as ""CZ01"" (whatever the sh*t THAT means), I've really no way of knowing.The men's bathroom had a ton of graffiti in it, but not the cool kind like at Emporium Barcade where it's intentional in an edgy sort of way.  Here, it was a normal, clean-ish bathroom that a bunch of people straight up vandalized. lolIt's not that I wouldn't want to return here-- because the pan pie is really, REALLY good --but since everybody and their grandma claims that they're ""Chicago's best pizza"" I feel obligated to try them all before making a 2nd lap around town.Get here early to avoid the swarm of people, and pray that your server doesn't randomly disappear.",21,10,positive
761,"My sister & I came here Monday afternoon and we made it in time for the lunch special. We tried Lou Manalti's the other night, but we weren't amazed. On the other hand, Pequod's took our breath away.The Chicago Lunch Special is Monday - Friday 11 AM to 3 PM. You get a 7"" cheese pan pizza and soda (no refills) for $4.95. If you want to add any other toppings, there is a charge per topping. For two lunch specials (w/ toppings), the bill came out to be around $12.One thing that I hate about Chicago deep dish pizza is the wait, but Pequod's was worth it. The crust was buttery and flakey. The sauce was amazing and it was cheesy (but not too cheesy). I highly recommend going here as the flavor is outstanding.",5,4,positive

763,Pequod's has really gotten down how to get the perfectly crispy crust. If you love a crispy crust then you will love Pequod's.The taste is great and is a good location for deep dish pizza.The only thing I will add is that they could be a bit more generous with the toppings. I could count the pieces of ham that received on a pizza on 1 hand. Most other pizza locations overload the pizza with toppings.,6,0,positive
764,"Been here several times now and the quality is just not consistent. It's a fine balance between burning the outer cheese too much and keeping it just at the right crispness - and they fail often. Sauce also hit or miss. Today it was too sweet. Sausage was great though. One of the most consistent things here. Crust - fluffier and thicker than Lou's buttercrust and overall tasty. Just be sure to ask for the outer cheese to not be burned to the point it's all black. Tasty crispy caramelized cheese isn't totally black, it's a dark brown.",6,5,negative
765,"The hype is definitely real. So this is how Chicagoan does pan pizza. Buttery flakey crust with nice and zesty tomato sauce. The caramelized crust is also really good. Here, you  build your own pan pizza, base comes with just cheese and sauce so add additional as you wish. Weekdays lunch special is probably the best deal. For $4.95, you get your own personal pan cheese pizza then add whatever toppings. Weekday lunch service is pretty quiet so if you're a tourist then I would recommend coming during this time.",6,2,positive

768,"We just spent $35 dollars on disappointment. We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushroom on Memorial Day for delivery. At first, I thought somehow my fiancé had just gotten sauce on the box, himself, and the table. I open the box to find most of the pizza was sauce and dough. We each ate a slice, and then decided the rest wasn't worth eating. We were both hungry and pausing between bites. This really didn't taste anything like the pizza we had at Pequod's before. The following weekend we had a frozen pizza from Costco that was a million times better. What we learned from our $35 dollars of disappointment: do not order delivery from Pequod's. Did I mention we waited close to two hours for this pizza?",3,3,negative

770,Place is much bigger than I thought.  We were seated on the 2nd floor. Needless to say even our big group of 23 people were quickly seated even though the place was so busy on a Thursday night.  It was my first time but we came here due to one person in our group saying it's the best deep dish pizza ever.  Well it was very good but it's not the best :). We ordered 5 large pan pizzas from regular cheese to sausage garlic to pepperoni garlic.  I'm so full as I ate 4 pieces.  The waitress was nice.  Don't know about the prices since I didn't pay.  My only complaint was the place was loud and we had to yell to talk and hear each other even though we were sitting so close to each other.  I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.,4,1,positive

773,"Forget Giordano's or Lou's, Pequod's definitely has the best deep dish in town. Whenever we have friends coming in from out of town wanting some deep dish we always take them here. Main reason we don't come here more often for our pizza cravings is because the wait is usually 1-2 hours on any night of the weekend.  The staff is friendly and the food is great. Definitely order some appetizers since you'll have to wait about 30-45min for the pizza. I'd recommend the breaded mushrooms and bruschetta.",4,0,positive
774,"This is my favorite pizza in the city! The staff is INSANE about checking and double checking ID's here, which is so weird for a pizza restaurant.

776,"Best deep dish in my opinion. I'm usually a thin crust type of gal but after my experience with Pequod's. Would have to say it's my top deep dish. Been here a few times whenever my friends or family visit I would take them to Pequod's and they absolutely loved it. Some even order some to go on their flight back to California. It has all the right flavors. Perfect crust. Not too hard or soft. Just about right. The last few times I was at Pequod's. I order the vegetarian, can't go wrong with just pepperoni, and also the meat lover dish. Also order a side of fries and garlic bread as well. Just to warn you if you decide to come here get ready to wait. There's always a wait here that's how good it is or if you prefer not to wait. Order to go. Or come on an off time. There were days I've came here around noon during a weekday and longest I waited was 15 mins but weekends your average wait time would be 2hrs. There's only street parking so it's hard to find if you're driving but I always uber here.",10,3,positive
777,Came here on a pizza tour; this was my second time here.  Ambiance: Large and crowded place. Pizza: We had the sausage pepperoni and it was quite yummy although quite heavy (maybe because we had been at two other pizza places before that).

782,"Hate to be harsh, but I found it totally meh ... Went for lunch today around 12:45PM, and it was a 40-minute wait. Sadly, I don't think it was worth it. Ordered the large cheese pan pizza, and here's how I would describe it: was mainly a crust, with a doughy ""filling"", and then a very thin layer of tomato sauce on top. It comes out kinda burnt too. Where was the cheese? Not sure that this is true deep dish pizza. And while I realize it was a cold day, it was so cold inside the restaurant that we - and everyone else dining - were wearing our coats while eating. (We ate downstairs so hopefully it's different/better upstairs.) On the plus side, our waitress was friendly and attentive, you get free refills on your soda, and the cheesy garlic bread and mozzarella sticks (ordered as appetizers) were fine. Alas, after all the hype, I don't feel the need to come back, as there have got to be better pizza options in this great food city of ours ...",8,5,negative
783,So maybe it was because we ordered take out but i honestly was not impressed.

I ordered fries for an appetizer and they came out quickly. The fries were really good and had some kind of seasoning on them to make them stand out. The pizza took awhile to come out and I expected that since it is made to order and deep dish pizza. The pizza was good  as advertised. The only downfall for my time at Pequod's was the wait to get cashed out.",2,1,positive
787,"Always great, and always worth the wait. Pequod's is, in my book, serves the best pizza in the city of Chicago. If you plan on coming though, know that during peak hours will could easily have an hour or more wait until you get seated, and then another 40 minutes to an hour before you get your pizza (not because they are slow, but because the deep-ish dish pizzas they serve take a long time to make). The bar has a good selection of beer, and the service is always friendly. On my most recent visit, about 2 weeks ago, we learned that the owners of Pequod's had opened a bar next door called Whale Tale. The great thing about that place is is that when you put your name in for a seat at Pequod's, your buzzer will work next door at Whale Tale. The people over there know that you are most likely there waiting for a table, and so the service is appropriately fast. Back to Pequod's though. Sure, ambiance-wise, it's a Blackhawks bar, but the pizza is the star of the show. Their pizza is, like I said before, deep-ish dish. I usually describe it as like a halfway deep dish. Pizzas are made in cast iron skillets and there is a layer of cheese baked in underneath and around the crust giving it a perfect, crunchy, parmesan seasoning all the way around. To me that is the best part. Pizza topping selections are plentiful, and they are not shy about loading them up onto the pizza. I've never had a bad experience here, but there was only one time that I was here that I didn't have to wait less than an hour for a table (I think it was the middle of the afternoon for some reason). I can not recommend this pizza enough. You should also note that they do have priority seating that you can access and set up from home before you venture out and take your chances with the wait time. That is definitely worth looking into.",16,2,positive
788,"In the last couple of years that I've come here, I've learned that the servers are snobby, rude people, but the pizza had always been great, so I've put up with their attitudes. But then yesterday I had this crappy pizza that did not seem the same pizza I've learned to love and be proud of. Whenever my relatives would come to Chicago, I'd put up with the long wait times cuz it was worth it all the way. Did something change with the recipes or ingredients? We ordered two large ones and before the cheese used to overpower and melt into the breading of the pan pizza, now it just looked like some toppings on a piece of bread if that makes sense. Anyway, I was disappointed. :L",5,4,negative

790,"4 stars for the very accommodating and very good service...but is it worth the Michelin hype? I didn't think so (3.5 stars for the pizza). The pizza crust is good, but when you order sausage in your pizza, you expect more than a few measly bits of sausage on your pizza. Seriously. My first slice was huge but had two tiny pieces of sausage. Good on the veggies, though. The next slice, which was smaller, did not fare much better. Alas, Pequod's, you will never replace my love of Lou Malnatti's with its stick of butter in the crust and wheel of sausage. Just to be clear, I didn't expect a wheel of sausage...just an adequate amount of sausage to reflect the medium pie we ordered. *sigh* Next time I'm in town, I will go back to my favorite, or even Giordano's which is a solid second in terms of pizza. This is clearly at least a third or a fourth. I really wanted to like you!!!",11,1,positive
791,"Visited Pequod's last week. My brother, nephew, and myself came out from California. I must say, you folks in Chicago don't know how good you have it there. You cannot get pizza half this good in California unless you make it yourself. We got 2 medium pizzas, sausage and pepperoni and sausage and onion. We are 3 big eaters and still had 2 pieces left over. The carmalized crust lived up to the hype, wasn't doughy at all, sauce was fantastic, and the sausage pieces were golf ball size. I loved the fennel taste and garlic. Servers were good and kept the water and beers coming as needed. I really enjoyed the old town feeling there as well. A dinner like that in CA would cost $100+, it was only $65 there. CA really sucks, at everything!!! I'm moving.",8,2,positive
792,"It is with great disappointment that I write a poor review for Pequod's. I just recently visited with great enthusiasm to eat Chicago Deep Dish at this location, but I left very saddened and dissatisfied with my experience. My main complaint is in regards to the timeliness and service. I had just arrived home from a long road trip and was excited to eat at a former favorite Chicago establishment. I visited on a Sunday evening around 7pm. When I arrived, I was greeted and told there would be a half hour wait, which I was ok with, expected, and accepted the pager to await to be seated. About 20 minutes had passed and I noticed a couple of parties that came in after me we're being seated before me. I waited a few more minutes and then approached the hostess to see where I was in line as I was concerned that I may have been overlooked. The hostess was quick to notice that she could not find my pager number on the list, despite having a pager number assigned. She apologized and said she would have me seated next. I was quickly assigned a table and as the other host was directing me to it, she explained that my pager had been called as indicated by the circle marking on the device, but didn't understand why it didn't go off to alert me that my table was ready. Again, the hostess apologized and said it was good that I mentioned something otherwise I could have continued to wait unknowingly as they proceeded to go through the waitlist disregarding my assigned pager number.My server came and took my drink and pizza order shortly after. I ordered a Small Deep Dish pizza and having been here before and aware of the signage regarding cooking and wait times for a deep dish, the wait began. There were a couple of parties across from me who just received their pizzas when I ordered, they ate and left as I waited. I also noted that I was watching the end of the 4th quarter of an NBA Playoff Game and started to watch the following playoff game close to Half Time.Basically I waited quite a while as the tables across from me had new parties seated and waiting whose pizza orders, one of which was a Large Deep Dish came out and was served at the same time as my Small Deep Dish was served. I expressed my concern to my server regarding the wait time, who seemed somewhat agitated that the wait time was an issue to me, explaining the cooking time can take up to 50 minutes. I could have mentioned, that was the only time I was checked on since I had placed my order and I explained that I was not arguing or complaining, just voicing my concerns regarding the obvious situation regarding the timeliness. My server said she would have a manager come by though I did not ask. I was already feeling miserable about the whole experience that honestly I just wanted to pay and leave. (Of note, I noticed the servers were using hand held pads for ordering and charging which I am sure could easily time stamp the events as they were placed.)A manager came over and apologized saying that he understood the situation, explained that it was busy, and  it just happened that all the pizza orders came out at the same time. I was offered 25% off my bill, which I honestly did not care to account for as a new server came by to check on me and who I asked to have my pizza boxed, that I just wanted to close out and pay.As a Chicagoan who has lived here for some time and has had positive memories of this place before, I will no longer return nor recommend this place to residents or visitors alike. Is it a pizza to experience? Possibly, but it is definitely not worth the wait and with so many options for a good Chicago Deep Dish, there are a number of better pizza places in this great city.I understand this review may not be significant to anyone that could go through the thousands of positive reviews, but for anyone that does happen to read through this, I hope you have a better experience if you decide to eat here.",16,7,negative

795,"Since discovering Lou Malnati's last year, I've decided that I like Chicago deep dish more than I thought I did. On our way to the airport, we were limited on time and therefore came here upon a friend's recommendation. I liked the feel of this spot. A bar/pizza joint. The service was excellent. Everyone was so friendly and nice to newbies like us. I liked their caesar salad. It was nice to munch on it while we waited for our pizza that takes about 20 minutes to make. So in comparing the two, I think I like Lou's better for a few reasons. Pequod's crust was too burnt/crunchy for me. There wasn't enough cheese. I like Lou's because of the perfect chunky tomato sauce to cheese ratio, as well as it not feeling insanely heavy by being too heavily breaded. But I do like this spot's vibe and their beer selection.",16,2,negative

797,"Pequods was recommended to us by numerous people, giving it the title of ""Best Pizza in Chicago"". We were anxious to try the amazing caramelized cheese crust everyone was raving about. We arrived at Pequods on a Friday at 5 pm, thinking we would beat the dinner crowd. Upon arrival, we were told the wait time would be 20-45 minutes. After a little more than an hour, we were finally seated. We placed our order, and our waitress informed us that the pizza would take about 75 minutes. I wish they would have told us that earlier, but we decided to wait it out since we already made it this far. They weren't lying when they said 75 minutes. When the pizza finally arrived, we devoured it in less than 10 minutes. Was it amazing? Yes! Would I wait 3 hours again? Probably not. Next time, we're gonna try to avoid the weekend dinner crowd. Waiting 3 hours for a pizza is kind of ridiculous. Plus, they have a great lunch deal. Now back to the pizza. The bottom of the crust was buttery and golden, with just the right amount of crunch. The caramelized cheese crust was just how I imagined it would be. It had a nice chew to it. The ratio of bread to cheese and toppings was perfect. Not too heavy like most deep dish pizzas. I'm officially giving Pequods my vote for best pizza in Chicago.Four stars for wait time. But I guess good things come to those who wait.",11,3,positive

806,"I wanted to kick off my first trip to Chitown right with a deep dish pizza. I was originally going to go to Lou Malnati's but my well-traveled friends steered me to Pequod's which is apparently where the real Chicagans go.My group of 4 waited an hour to be seated at 8pm on a Thursday. It took close to another hour before we actually got our deep dish pie. Caesar salad (9) - Pretty basic. It was pricey considering the salad came with nothing but what tasted like packaged croutons and one lone cherry tomato.Large w/ italian beef, mushrooms, onions (30) - Chicago is know for its italian beef sandwich so I figured may as well hit 2 birds with 1 stone and get it on my pie. The pizza came piping hot and the cheese were perfectly gooey. Pequod's is known for the burnt cheese that coats the edge of the pie and that was probably my favorite part. I'm usually not big on crust and unfortunately Pequod's wasn't an exception. I like my crust to be crispier but theirs is on the doughy, airy side.Was it delicious? Hell yes. Would I wait 2 hours again? Doubtful.Should you go if it's your first deep dish experience in Chicago? Definitely.",8,1,positive

They took us up these old metal stairs to the upper floor. Loved the atmosphere! We were given shabby menus that you know thousands have seen and ordered the pan pizza which they were known for. We were told it would be a 40 min wait (they also had a sign as we came in that notified customers of the wait time). We ordered their bruschetta as we waited. It was phenomenal! The pizza seemed to come quicker than we expected. IT. WAS. AMAZING! It will haunt me in a good way. Staff was great. Heard about the Whale Tale. Can only imagine how crazy this place gets during the prime season. Will most definitely be back!!!,6,3,positive

812,"Came here with my friend for lunch to try another Chicago-style pizza place, since I had tried Lou Malnati's during my visit to Chicago last year. We were seated immediately upon entering. The interior is not huge; the restaurant is deep but not very wide. The atmosphere was very pub/bar like, which I did not expect. Service was friendly and our waitress was great. She said it would be about a 45-minute wait for deep dish pizza, so we tried to place our order quickly. I think the actual wait time ended up being just a little over thirty minutes though. I also ordered one slice of thin crust just to try, and added one of the ""premium toppings"" of Italian beef (apparently also very Chicago) to it. It was a big slice and not bad, but I prefer my thin crust even crunchier (think New York-style pizza, and yes, I realize that I shouldn't be expecting that while in Chicago). All of the deep dishes start off with just cheese and you customize your pie from that point after picking a size. Each additional topping costs extra, and the cost of each topping depends on the diameter of your pizza. You can also order half-toppings (I think it means it is only put on half of your pizza) and premium toppings. The deep dish was decent, but not particularly memorable in my opinion. I enjoyed the ""caramelized edges"" mentioned on the menu, but instead of the crunchy crust I was expecting, it was actually just darkened cheese which they must sprinkle along the pan's edge. I think I prefer a crunchier crust overall, which is why I usually get thin crust during the rare occasions that I eat pizza at all.I'm glad I tried Pequod's and their food is not bad, but I think Lou Malnati's better suits my tastes (just a personal opinion).",10,3,positive

814,Not a big pizza person but the pizza here is unlike anything I've ever had. The caramelized cheese makes the pizza and it is supported by great crust and sauce. Don't be afraid to order randomly off the menu the quality of food shows through all their dishes. Service is always great and thorough even when they are extremely busy. Always worth the wait.,4,1,positive
815,Overall a good pizza but the hype was high and the pizza was just good.  The crust was overdone and while there were PLENTY of toppings the taste was just good.  Nothing wrong.  The brochette had a nice tomato based topping on garlic bread but was not worth the almost $8.  Calling ahead helped greatly with the wait and the service was good.Added a pic,6,2,negative

Atmosphere: 5/5Multiple TVs playing sports 24/7, what's not to like?Rathskeller like lighting, fun.Pizza: 1.5/5 (we ordered deep dish and thin crust).Sauce: bitter, tasted like it was cooked and not laddled on fresh. Cheese/toppings: Small gobs of mazzorella on the top, did not cover whole pizza! Light on the meat.Crust: too much flower, cracker like consistency (too much flower, acidic bite), and no char!!!

820,"Yeah, decided to try and give them another shot today. Figured I'd try carryout this time. Went to see a movie across the street, then afterward walked in, and placed my order, pre-paid and all. They said an hour to an hour and 15 it would be ready. Came back after running misc errands at about an hour and 20 minutes later. Nope...needed 10-15 more in the oven. Took 30. There's just no drive for service here. It's a shame that the food is an easy 5-star rating but the general attitude towards the customer is a 1-2. Do better. Im kind of done with this place. Lou's has exceptionally better service and if Pequods is #1A for pizza Lou's is #1B. Im fine with that.PS: Funny side note: They have the 2014 Zagat survey of their restaurant posted on the wall inside near the carryout pickup...Service is rated a full 8 points lower than food.

The interior is cute and reminds you of any of the other Chicago pizza joints, and the waitress, while overwhelmed, was still friendly. The sausage pizza was absolutely AMAZING!!!!! I have been a die hard fan of Gino's (despite being told it's a tourist pizza, not the real deal) but I may have to change my allegiance...I had been told this was where true Chicagoans go for their deep dish, and now I totally get why.

827,"I've ordered delivery from Peaquods a couple of times in the past and had I never been to the actual restaurant, this might be a 5 star review.I feel like the longer I live in Chicago, the more I hate deep dish, but of all the deep dish places, this is one of my more preferred...It's saucy, there's a hell of a lot of toppings (so you don't feel ripped off paying $30+ for a damn pizza), and though heavy - you don't feel as terrible as you do after eating Giordanos, per say.My visit to the actual Peaquods though (and I've been twice), was kind of disappointing. The actual pizza parlor is a little reminiscent of a dive bar (similar to the feel of Pizano's on State/Gold Coast). My complaint though has to do with the waitstaff. It really seemed like they were doing the minimum. ""Can i take your order?"" ""here's your food"" ""Here's your bill."" It just took away from the deep dish pizza experience.That all being said, I still recommend Peaquod's to all my out of town friends (vs. some of the other well known deep dish chains in Chicago).",4,7,positive

Our pizzas came about 45 mins after ordering (which was quicker than the expected 50-60 minutes). Got two deep dish personal pan pizzas, one pepperoni and one with pepperoni and veggies. The crust wasn't too massive (which is why I don't like Giordano's), but I didn't think it had much flavor either. The toppings were nicely cooked and there was a good ratio of sauce and cheese.Nice atmosphere, the front windows open, good selection of drinks and apps to keep you satisfied while waiting on the pizza. There must have been group seating upstairs, but the downstairs has a bar and two and four tops. Next time I'm going to pop over to the new nail place just across the street to get a quick mani while waiting!",7,0,positive

We shared a small pan pizza with pepperoni and mushroom and it was delicious! They are generous with their toppings, which helps balance the thicker crust. I also really enjoyed their tomato sauce, which is surprising because I'm usually not a fan of super saucy pizzas, but the flavor was phenomenal.  I've been in Chicago a few years now and have been to all the major places. Pequod's pizza isn't what comes to mind when I think of ""deep dish"" due to the fact that it's not stuffed. Instead it's a thicker caramelized bread crust that's balanced with a generous portion of good quality ingredients. Regardless, it's a Chicago must! I really enjoyed the pizza and would definitely recommend it!",10,2,positive
835,Excellent deep dish pizza in a dive-y setting. We had a small and it was plenty for the two of us with leftovers to take home. Loved the carmelized crust.

836,"The reason I came back was bc the pizza is done right !! So so good  Good timing: did a 9pm delivery for the identical pizza & it was delivered to my house tonight at 10pm, but it was very skimpy on the toppings including the cheese. I also had only 7 pieces of green peppers and the onions were a great portion. That cost 1 star in my book. Was kinda bummed. The second observation for tonight's meal was the $6 cheesecake that was smaller than small and very much not the value I'm used too at this restaurant. When I say small, I'm talking like""is this a bad joke or something?""I went to take a picture of it but my boyfriend had already eaten most of it. My comparison for this is that the $8 cheesecakes at the cheesecake factory are litterally 4x the size and gourmet to the heavens... I was really let down about this tonight bc we saved it for after the movie and we were so excited running and racing each other to the fridge to get there first.. it was our date night tonight. So This cost 1 star also. I have eaten at your restaurant many times before and it's always everything that I want in a pizza joint. So I know you can do it right.Tonight fell a little short.",5,3,negative

838,"During my short weekend trip to Chicago, I had the pleasure of trying 3 of (from my research) the top deep dish pizza joints in the city. Pequod's is ranked #2 for me.I highly recommend going to their website and making a reservation right away. They will text you a day before to confirm your ressie and you're set. When we walked in on a Saturday night at 7pm it was PACKKKED. The party of 2 ahead of us was given a 2.5 hour wait time. We were a party of 7 and we were seated right away. MAKE A RESERVATION.Loud, large dive bar feel. + bruschetta - Skip it. It's bland and not good at all here.+ ravioli pesto and marinara - Both were tasty, but nothing to brag about. If you're craving ravioli and want to order one, I'd say go with the pesto.+ PIZZAAAAAACRUST - their ""caramelized crust"" is their specialty and what separates them from the rest. It's basically burnt layers of cheese -- ok that doesn't sound too appetizing but trust me, it's so crunchy and SO good. TOPPINGS - You can choose your own toppings (from basic and premium lists). They say  not to pile too much on.-- Sausage and pepperoni - per our waiter's recommendation. Basic, but SO SOLID. I think would've been better with mushrooms and bell peppers.-- Bell peppers, mushrooms, and Italian beef - also per our waiter's recommendation. It was good, but the beef didn't really go well with the pizza overall. I wish we would've gotten more veggies and tried the meatballs instead.I think if we weren't starving and did more research on which toppings to choose, we would've enjoyed our pizza way more. Nonetheless, Pequod's is still a MUST on your hit-list for Chicago eateries and we're glad we got to enjoy it with little hassle/wait.",16,1,positive

Their beer paired well with the slices. The crust of the pan was rather bread like and dry. The sauce was balanced a little acidic not too sweet. The amount of cheese was nice and the burned cheese on the crust was delicious! The sausage was big chunks of great quality. The thin crust pizza had a lot of cheese (too much really) as well as a quite dry crust. We don't plan to come back, the pizza competition in Chicago is no joke and this was pretty mediocre.

You've been waiting to get a table for a while, and the food is going to take even longer once you're seated, and you won't be sad you ordered the wings while you're waiting.Delivery is pretty great, too, but don't order when you're hungry as it usually takes a while (90 min or more, sometimes 2 hours) even if you're close by.

For a dollar more you can add a topping. I'm not sure if I'm misremembering, but they used to consider a beer (Miller Lite?) as a fountain drink, but they haven't continued that as of recent visits.The wait for the pan takes around 30-40 minutes, so I kill that time by hanging out with the friend(s) I've brought here. The pizza is enough to fill you up, and it's just a quality crust with the right amount of crunch, give, butteriness, and burn.I'm not particularly a follower of ball game or other sports, so take everything I say now with a grain of salt: the sports vibe here is as Chicago as it gets without having to go to Wrigleyville.Love this place.",3,0,positive

Every single seat in the house was full and there was a huge crowd waiting for a spot when we left. If you can handle the crowd and the wait times you'll have the best deep dish in Chicago.",9,1,positive
875,"It has all the feel of a friendly neighborhood restaurant with my favorite deep dish pizza in town. The interior is cozy and warm and the building is multi-story.The signature of the deep dish here is the cheesy, caramelized crust. It looks blackened and burnt, but it tastes delicious! The crust is actually not all that thick or bready despite it being deep dish. The pizza sauce has a nice sweetness to it that's not too overwhelming and the cheese is delicious. As for toppings, we had Italian sausage and spinach. I would certainly recommend the sausage.",9,1,positive
876,"Ok pizza- perhaps a little overhyped but had some tasty parts.  Ordered pizza for pickup- deep dish and a thin crust pizza. Flavor was decent but the pizzas were a little imbalanced in terms of bites.  Sausage, spinach, and onion on the deep dish- a lot of dough in each bite and the dispersion of toppings could have been more even.  Some pieces had a single large hunk of sausage at an arbitrary location so only the bites when you got to that part of the slice would have sausage :(.  The thin crust- the ninja turtle pizza as I call it (pepperoni and mushroom combination) was the better tasting of the two pizzas bite for bite but was a little salty, greasy, and had a hint of olive flavor although there were no olives ordered.  Environment was popping though and seems like a great place for a group outing.",4,2,negative
877,"Pequod's serves up the quintessential Chicago deep dish experience. It's a fairly small restaurant in a residential neighborhood across the street from a movie theater. We got extremely lucky as there was practically no wait on a Sunday night. Our server was great, super friendly and willing to accommodate changes to our order. The pizza took about an hour to get ready, so definitely order some appetizers. Their cheesy garlic bread dipped in marinara is delicious and extremely hot, so give yourself a minute or two before you devour it. I highly recommend the wings as well. I personally prefer the barbecue wings over the buffalo, which has a nice kick if that's what you're feeling. As for the pizza, there's no doubt about the ""deep dish"" part. It's thicker than the ones served at Lou's. One slice can count as two slices of a normal pizzas. You get to pick your own toppings. We ordered a large and I'd say it would easily feed 5 hungry adults. Overall I was very happy with the experience and would come back!",14,3,positive
878,"This place exemplifies a great pizza experience. The pizza I get is what they are known for, Chicago Style! Yet the do it a little different the dough is so thick unlike other Chicago style pizzas the toppings are mostly on top. While it may not sound great it is because it makes the pepperoni always done perfectly! If you don't like it crunchy the pepperoni just underneath will suit you. I have tried other toppings and from the ground beef , mushrooms, peppers and sausage everything maintains it's flavor but yet doesn't over shadow the sauce that is great in its own right. Now the very edge of the pizza comes out burnt so don't be alarmed!! This is a must visit for anyone in the area! They usually have a 45min. Wait on the weekends so I am a fan over the personal pizza lunch special!!",7,1,positive
879,"I'm a New Yorker and swear by NYC pizza. NOTHING is better. However I will say Pequod is nothing to play with in the pizza game. I came here looking for the best deep dish. I didn't have time to experience all the deep disp spots so I looked at a few reviews and narrowed my search down to two places Lou Malnati's and Pequod. Don't waste your time, money and calories going anywhere else but Pequod for deep dish. 4 stars because it's not NYC pizza.",2,1,positive

881,"Look, you either love it or you think its nothing special. The ingredients are great. Sure, sometimes I wish it had a little more sauce, though I've got enough to go around ;) But what sets it apart from the rest is the crust. The caramelized crust makes eating it a delight. It might be the best part. At the other well known Deep Dish Pizza chains in Chicago, more often then not, people don't eat the crust, and that's just sad and wasteful. Shame on them for making dry, thick, no-fun crust. Stomach real-estate is scarce. Fill your core with good crust. ""Pequod's .. it's crust-have pizza."" - me",7,3,positive
882,"Each time i've been here, the quoted wait time has been longer than it actually has been to get a table. I really enjoyed the pizza. I would describe this pizza as more ""bready"" than some of the other pizza institutions around town, but it was quite good. The pizza is well assembled and if you were really bold you could even eat it with your hands because the sauce and toppings are not overflowing like other establishments. This is a solid pie, I would put it in its own league!",5,0,positive
883,"Best Chicago pizza! I'm in from Miami during hurricane Irma and I am coming to my pizza spot! This place never disappoints me! Start delivery to Bay Harbor Island, Florida!

884,"I feel like I need to give Pequod's another chance because so many people have said good things. My first try though wasn't that great. I got a thin crust delivered, so that could be why the crust wasn't crisp. The tomato sauce didn't have flavor and I thought the crust was too thick for a think crust. The bread was a little dense too. I didn't eat much of that. I will give it another try and go for the deep dish next time.",4,1,negative
885,"When I have friends come in from out of town they always want deep dish. Everyone will tell you to try this or that. Here's the thing. Pequod's is my favorite deep dish in the city.

What a treat this place was - the pie was just as it was on TV and maybe even a little better. It takes a while, but they tell you that up front and well worth the 40 minutes.  In that 40 minutes, we had a couple beers and a chicken wing appetizer. The wings were very well done with ample sauce. When the pizza arrived, I immediate regret ordering a medium for two people. It could feed 6. The browned cheese on the outside of the crust was the highlight. I coulda eaten just that. The place is great. Good atmosphere, only one moderately grumpy employee (who isn't at 10:30 on a Thursday night?), clean and great food. Eat here, you'll love it just like I did.",11,2,positive

Too much dough at the bottom in comparison with Giordano's pizza. I would rate their pizza 4/5, was not ""wow"" personally.",2,0,positive
890,"Was an unfortunate let down.  After multiple, glowing reviews I was excited to enjoy this apparent pizza institution.  To the point, ordered lunch size 7"" pie with sausage and mushrooms.   After first bite, added the salt and pepper.  Once halfway through, likened the experience to a ""biscuit pizza"".  I don't get it.  Dough was dry, not enough cheese, had to create a good bite rather than the meal supply plenty of flavor.   Server was polite.  Counts for one of the above stars.   Next trip back, not likely to hit this place again on the way to O'Hare.",6,1,negative
891,One of my favorite pizza places in Chicago. A little different with the burnt cheese crust but it's delicious. They always have a long wait if you go around lunch time or dinner time. I usually get the pepperoni with mushrooms or hot peppers. They do have some limited beer selections. I would recommend anything really on the menu. I also like my pizza well done which add a crisp taste to the crust.,7,0,positive
892,I frequent the Webster regal theater and my friends love eating here before or after a movie. I tried this place twice. Once for the pizza and the second time I got a salad because I wasn't feeling the pizza at all. I hear everyone talk about how great it is but to me it's just 'alright'. I don't really think their is anything special about their pizza or the taste. If you're looking for a unique taste don't expect to find it here but if you just want pizza and beer at a reasonable price for the area... Then go here!,4,0,negative

896,"I'm a big fan of deep dish pizza and Pequod's is definitely one of my favorites. I'm used to the suburban location, which is a lot smaller, but this location was larger and much, much busier, which was expected. Went here on a Sunday night around 7:30p with a pretty large group (11 people).  There wasn't a problem getting seated, which was nice, but we were a bit crammed in a round booth table. The server was really nice and very patient as she took our drink orders right away as we waited for some of the others to get to the restaurant. There wasn't that big of a selection but they had a decent sized list. We ordered two orders of the appetizer platters which was just enough for our large group. I really liked the fried zuchinni, but wasn't that big of a fan of the jalepeno poppers. We ordered 2 large and 1 medium pan pizza. It took about maybe an hour to arrive but it was worth it!. We had one with Italian beef and giardenera, another with just sausage, and the last with mushroom and spinach. Everyone enjoyed all of them! The crust was crisp to perfection. Definitely enough for 10 people! There were some leftovers but not a lotFor first timers--I recommend ordering an appetizer since pizzas take a while to cook, and if you are ordering the deep dish pizzas, go no more than 2 toppings, as it might get a bit overwhelming.",14,1,positive

Walking in to put my name on the wait list there was a sign that stated your wait time for pizza was 50 minutes after you order! Okay no big deal, I ordered wings, which were pretty darn good, to kill the time along with a pitcher of beer. An hour later I started to question the pizza wait time just as a  manager came over to explain that my pizza was accidentally given to another table, therefore my wait would be pushed back another 30 minutes!! It was already about 11pm I was so tired, but nevertheless we waited. The manager sent over a complimentary order of wings and took the pizza off of the bill. However, the pizza was the wrong order but we were not going to send it back after waiting 1.5 hours",3,2,negative

Haven't tried much else on their menu but it all looks good.",6,0,positive
899,"Pequod's was pretty busy around 7:30pm on a Sunday night. We had a party of 11 and we were seated right away which I think was pure luck lol because this place is always packed. We were able to sit in the corner booth by the fireplace which was a nice touch cause it was pretty cold on that side. We ordered 2 appetizer combos which had breaded mushrooms, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and jalapeno poppers. I liked all the options and it was cooked perfectly. I would def order this again to have a taste of 4 appetizers. I also think it was around $10 for a platter which isn't bad. We got 3 pizzas. 1 large sausage pizza, 1 large veggie (mushroom and spinach), and 1 large half giardiniera and italian beef. There was a confusion when we ordered the last pizza because we wanted the full pizza to be italian beef but only half of it have giardiniera on top. All the pizzas were delicious and cooked great. It did take like 45-1 hour for the pizzas to come, but it was well worth it. I'm very loyal to Lou's, but Pequod's is pretty up there. If you're visiting Chicago, you should def check this place out.",16,4,positive
900,So delicious! We came here for lunch on a Sunday around 2pm. There was no wait for a table for three of us. Or server was friendly. We ordered a thin crust and deep dish. They brought out the thin that was done just a few minutes before the deep dish so we could get started enjoying it. We got sausage pepperoni and both were very tasty!,3,0,positive
901,"Best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago. That's my opinion, but you need to try this pizza before you disagree. Let me explain my stance:They get the ratio of ingredients right. Dough, there's a lot of it, but it's light and fluffy. It's the backbone of the pizza but it doesn't dominate. It's delicious and hot and bready, and it won't feel like cement in your stomach. The crust is still sturdy and crispy.Cheese, less cheese than the other deep dish slices, in the best way. You taste it, but you're not chomping through puddles of grease in a cheesy swamp. The burnt ends are a culinary treasure, chewy with sweet, intense flavor, makes the crust the best bite.Sauce, the best standalone sauce in the city. Sweet! You can taste the tomato. It's not too acidic. Thick and applied liberally. Toppings, so generous. If you order pepperoni (the best topping) you get a tight weave of pepperoni that covers the whole pie. There's no other pizza place that borderlines too much pepperoni, it's a wonderful problem to have. In summary, the construction of this pizza makes it the best in the city. It's okay to disagree with me, but not before you've tried it.Order in and out are both challenging experiences. There's usually a pretty heft wait if you're dining on the weekends. Navigating the crowded entrance way to pick up your takeout order is pretty frustrating. Whatever.",18,7,positive
902,"Delicious pizza, authentic and old school setting. The perfect experience for my first Chicago deep dish. Really enjoyed the pizza and ambiance here.

903,"This is easily one of the best pizza places in the country. I came here as a stop from business trip. I ordered the personal pan 10 inch pizza with sausage Canadian ham/baconAnd mushrooms. The crust of the pizza was probably one of the most unique features of food that I have ever tried. You could tell that a lot of thought and effort went behind perfecting the the sauce, don't get me started on the sauce. You could tell that it was authentic and homemade. The sausage was definitely something worth writing home about it looked like a quarter size the meatball but it tasted like a perfection  the textures of the meat to bread were excellent and blended very well with the homemade sauce of the Pizza. I think overall the most unique thing about the meal was the sauce and meats. I'm from Philly so take this with a grain of salt, the best cheesesteaks/Philadelphian food can be found at Hilton in Philly",9,0,positive
904,"If you are up by Wrigley, you need to stop in this pizza place! My favorite pizza in Chicago is Lou Malnati's but this is a very close second. We ordered a thin crust and a pan pizza and they were both awesome. The topping were free and the pizza had the perfect proportions of cheese, toppings and sauce. The service was excellent. We had a waitress that was training and she did a great job. As others have said, parking is difficult so we took an Uber.",6,1,positive

I placed an order for deliver (thin crust, sausage, mushrooms, garlic, and tomato). Starting with the positive....toppings are AMAZING!!! So fresh and delicious. Why 3 stars? Probably the worst crust I have ever tasted. It totally had no flavor and tasted like regular bread versus pizza dough. Also the delivery took almost 2 hours.

We were told there was a 60-90 min wait to be seated plus once seated 45-50 wait for our pizza order. We were super sad and not in the mood to wait 2.5 hours for pizza, so we ordered it to go and took it back to our hotel. (This was a 50 min wait). The bar area is super small, so we couldn't get a seat. We decided to sit outside and wait for our pizza. We did meet some cool people while all of us were waiting for our pizza or to be seated. We ordered 1 pepperoni and 2 pepperoni and sausage pizzas. Yes, the crust is caramelized and yummy! The toppings yummy!! The only negative is that there is not enough cheese in the pizza. It tasted more like bread and toppings. We did try Gino's East for deep dish pizza the next night and that was more tasty. Toppings and cheesy! Yum yum.

It was mostly cheese and bread, I didn't taste much garlic. The pizza was great! I'm not usually a fan of pan because it's too much crust but I didn't feel that way at Pequod's. The pizza was loaded with toppings. The edges were crispy and cheesy. And the crust was not too overpowering. Sauce was good too.",4,1,positive

Two large cylindrical slices of bread topped with gooey melted cheese and a strong taste of garlic. Probably not the best idea to order before trying to down an entire deep dish. Main course was a 10"" with mushrooms ($13ish). Gobs of marinara sauce soaking thick bready goodness. Very filling pizza though I did not like the chewy burnt crust along the edges (marinara didn't help there).

By around 5pm, the place was completely packed with a wait to be seated. Appetizer Combo ($9.95): Deep fried zucchini, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, and mushrooms! 2 sauces accompany the plate of deep fried goodness: ranch and the most perfect cocktail sauce. I enjoyed all but the jalapeno poppers which had a tad too much cheese. Perfect appetizer to share.Medium Pan Pizza ($15.50): Toppings range from $1.45-$3.50 each for add on. We added sausage & pepperoni to our beautiful 6 slice deep dish pizza. I absolutely LOVE crust on a pizza and Pequods delivered.

930,"I recently had dinner here with a group of 10 people, ages ranging from mid-30s to late 40s.  We had attended the Cubs game earlier in the day and decided to have pizza for dinner.  I have been to this pizzeria previously.  The pizza is always outstanding, but the service is average at best.  However, several individuals in the group were visiting from out-of-town and wanted to have dinner at Pequod's.  The service our group experienced was horrible.  We waited about an hour for our table, which wasn't unusual for a Saturday night.  We were seated and our waitress asked to take our drink orders.  For our group of 10, we ordered two pitchers of beer.  The waitress quickly informed us that based on instructions from the manager, we were ""one and done"" so we could at most order one pitcher of beer.  We were shocked by her response and asked her to explain.  She was incredibly rude and indicated that her manager concluded that we had attended the Cubs game and appeared to have consumed too much alcohol; therefore, the pizzeria made the decision to limit our group to one drink per person.  We asked to talk to someone else.  A second employee of the restaurant approached our table, looked at one of the members of our group, and stated ""he entered the pizzeria and was slurring and had glassy eyes"", so our alcohol consumption was being limited.  This employee's assessment was false.  The individual in our group who was being accused of this behavior asked clarifying questions, and the employee, appearing embarrassed, left to find the manager.  The manager came to our table and explained that he had asked his employees to monitor our group and determine if we were fit to have more than one drink.  He subsequently apologized and acknowledged that his staff had clearly misunderstood his instructions.  While I appreciate the manager's response, his staff's behavior to our group was offensive.  While our pizza was very good, I will not return to this restaurant.  There are too many good pizzerias in Chicago that treat their customers with respect.

Sure, it's not in a tourist trap like Mag Mile or Navy Pier, but I think you should ask yourself at what lengths will to go to in order to obtain premium pizza. If your answer is a couple blocks. There's no hope for you. Just kidding, you'll be fine, but you're missing out. Grab an Uber, take the bus, idc just go to Pequod's.",2,1,positive
939,"My boyfriend and I were in town for spring break and came here for dinner on a Sunday night after seeing a movie. It was a little past 6pm and there was already a good crowd outdoors waiting to be seated. Thankfully as a party of two, we were seated immediately. I had read about Pequod's on a list of top spots for Chicago pizza, but eating here was completely unplanned, which made it all the better.We ordered a small pepperoni and sausage pizza with cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer. We didn't expect the garlic bread to literally be two slices of bread with cheese and garlic on top. We could have done without it, but since it takes an hour for the pizza to be made, it was nice to have something to chew on.My recommendation is to come hungry! A small pizza is more than enough for two in my opinion. The crust was super crispy and the sauce was sweeter than expected but still really great. They were very generous with the toppings. We ate half and took the other half to go and honestly we loved it even more the next morning after heating it up.",10,2,positive
940,"Dont understand what all the hype is about. Waited over an hour for a table. They had one poor girl working the host stand, not enough. When we finally got sat our table was in the middle of a loud room on the second floor with uncomfortable chairs. The salad came out before the beer without utensils. The pizza took ages. The crust was burnt, or as they say ""caramelized,"" but the rest of the pizza was decent. Our server seemed too busy to take care of us. Of all the places to get deep dish in Chicago wont be returning to this one.",2,2,negative
941,I have ordered pick up twice from this restaurant. Both times the pizza is cold and the pick-up time was 1.5 hours. It seems they need help determining pick-up time vs. serving fresh food. I will not be back.,1,1,negative
942,"Hello, FOOD SNOB here.I would have given this place another star but they really need to have a better air conditioning system. Especially when it is 90 degrees outside. It is very uncomfortable when your sweating and eating hot pizza. The pizza was good but I wish I could have enjoyed it more. I especially loved the CARAMELIZED Crust. Great environment. Great service.There was a show on one of the cable stations rating this Pizza 2nd best in the country.I dont think its quite that good, but it is good.",8,1,negative
943,"BEST PIZZA EVER.I genuinely don't know what else to say about this place other than the three words posted about. For the first time, I am speechless about what I ate. I got the deep dish pizza. It looks burnt at first but they actually line the baking sheet with cheese and so it's just cooked cheese. It's delightful and brilliant. Beware, it is also so so filling.",2,0,positive

From the crust to the sauce to the cheese to the toppings, everything balanced out perfectly. I found the sauce at Lou Malnati's to be a bit too acidic for my tastes, but that was not the case at Pequod's.Would 100% return for deep dish if I visit Chicago again.",6,1,positive
946,One of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago and it's worth the wait. It's usually about an hour or more wait but with good reason. Call ahead earlier in the day and get your name on the list.

947,"Great pizza! Had been hearing about it from other people so was curious to give it a try. I liked the option to add on so many different toppings - we were feeling particularly ""adventurous"" so we got anchovies on half of the pizza, and it was SO good. The deep dish here is definitely really yummy, although I must say that I'm not very good at telling similar foods part so I couldn't really tell you how it was different from Lou's. Maybe slightly less cheesier?? Idk. But regardless I would say it was definitely great!",5,0,positive

950,"Disappointing Pequod's experience on Super Bowl Sunday.  My friend had a party, and ordered (through Door Dash) at noon for a 6:30pm delivery.  Now, I get that's it the Super Bowl, so they were likely busy, but they should've been prepared.  And that's why my friend ordered at noon.The door dash driver was there on time, and kept sending my friend updates that he was just sitting there waiting for them to give him the pizzas to deliver.  He finally arrived an hour after we were supposed to originally get them. Getting late pizzas wouldn't have been such an issue, but the order was completely wrong.  One was supposed to be a thin-crust half-Hawaiian, half-cheese, but instead it was cheese and pineapple on one side and cheese and ham on the other.  The deep-dish was supposed to be half sausage and half pepperoni, but the pizza instead had no meat and had green peppers on the whole thing.  The pizza tasted okay, not great, but the garlic bread we got wasn't good, either.Again, I get Super Bowl Sunday is a big day for pizza places, but this should not have been a surprise to them  Getting the pizza late AND having the order be completely wrong, especially for the price paid, is extremely disappointing.  I'm sure the experience in the restaurant is much different/better, but this was not a good experience.",3,3,negative
951,"Getting deep dish in Chicago was a no brainer for me during my first trip to the city. With so many choices and opinions, it was hard to choose which one to try. After some recommendations and online reviews, we decided to try Pequod's. I was pretty much sold when I heard 'caramelized cheese crust' (a specialty of theirs). For appetizers, my friends and I got the cheesy garlic bread which is super cheesy (!!) with the right amount of garlic and butter, it was a great way to trigger our appetite while waiting for the pizza. I've been warned by locals that the pizza at Pequod's is delicious but not the best representation of a Chicago-style 'deep dish' pizza, and I can see why. The crust is best described as a thick crust and the pizza itself was not the ""so deep you'll get lost in the ooey gooey layers of melted cheese and toppings"" kind of deep dish. Because of this, my boyfriend was not too impressed. I, on the other hand, thought it was pretty good and would have no problem returning (but maybe after trying other deep dish spots). What made this pizza truly stand out and worth trying is the caramelized cheese crust. The cheese added a nice texture and salty/cheesy flavor to the dish. Overall, the pizza is a solid 4 and the crust, 5 -- I mean, who doesn't love burnt cheese?",15,4,positive
952,"So this was a pretty good deep dish. I found it very annoying that they don't call their pizzas what they are- calling it a pan pizza when it's clearly not. Anyway, the crust is probably the best I've ever had, but the filling left much to be desired, nothing special, at all. However, overall it was an enjoyable deep dish pizza.",5,1,positive

954,"OK. OK. So my first review was a bit grumpy. But C'mon, a 3 hour rolling delay for a table?For fathers day my very lovely family ordered a carry-out pizza from the Morton Grove location and brought it home.And it was (drumroll please)...fine. It was better than Giordano's or Uno or Gino's. But not better than Pizzano's or Lou Malnati's. Not enough cheese despite the wonderful burnt cheese around the edges, the crust was thick and really just bread, the sauce was OK. I'm glad I tried it.",7,2,negative
955,"We checked out this Chicago pizza place on our way home from road tripping to the west. We picked it because it had great reviews on none other then YELP.COM. my husband and I have been to Chicago a few other times ( mostly just flying into and out of O'HARE) so we have had other deep dish/ pan style pizza. Unfortunately this pizza was just ENNNN, nothing too special but it wasn't bad. The edges were crispy and blackened, melted cheese and slightly greasy pepperoni, the good kinda. Other pizzerias defiantly have better style pizza with lots of layers of cheese and mountains of toppings more like a pizza cake. Pequod's was 90% dough, layer of sauce and the traditional cheese and pep. Also it roughly took about 40 mins for the pizza to be fully completed, ( which was a really long time for to-go order placed on a Tuesday at roughly 2 pm --- I cant image how long you would have to wait if your going/ ordering at a busy time ) which is kinda of a long wait for 1 medium cheese and pep pie... I don't think we would come here again because basically it was just okay, nothing special, just an average pizza & an atrocious wait time..",6,4,negative

This pizza was absolutely the worst,(a solid 4/5 because I'm a New Yorker) my ego cannot concur enough with my taste buds.  Original Deep dish was a solid 4/5, thin crust was clearly also a 4/5. Beer selection was great. Ambiance was very fun, family friendly and casual.  I enjoyed the garden salad as my appetizer.The Staff were friendly and accommodating.  I bothered them a lot for multiple beer runs, pizza slices and a plethora of odd request like their phone numbers and if they wanted to go out on any dates to no avail which left them to clearly give them 4 stars.In all honesty this place was awesome.  Food environment and everything was on point.

I don't know, but whatever the case, it just didn't live up to the expectations I had.I went on a Saturday night (it was very busy, so much that I could barely hear my friend while we waited to be seated) and found that the crowd consisted of your standard Depaul area crowd. The wait was much longer than anticipated (over an hour!) and when we finally were seated, service was a bit lackluster.We ordered a cheese pizza which boasted a caramelized crust, but when it arrived it just looked burnt. The taste wasn't that special either and I found myself wishing for some Giordano's. Sadly, I don't think this place is for me.",0,1,negative

964,"My personal favorite deep dish pizza in the city! The pizza is delicious, and I normally don't love deep dish pizza. I love the crispy pepperoni as well.The only negative thing I will say is that we ordered a Caesar salad as an appetizer and it was literally a bed of lettuce with about 4-5 croutons and that was it, and it wasn't even the right kind of lettuce for a Caesar. The dressing wasn't mixed in either, so it was not at ALL worth it to get the salad. However, take it for what it's worth--their specialty is deep dish pizza and not salads.If you've ever heard of Pequod's before then you probably know this, but expect to wait a LONG time for your table--but it's definitely worth the wait!",8,0,positive

969,"***Pequod's Pizzeria is an okay deep dish pizza spot though I definitely prefer Lou Malnati's***Pequod's is a pizzeria and bar located just outside of Downtown Chicago. You will have to take a taxi or drive to get there. It feels like you are in a Chicago institution once you step inside with the patrons, the small business look and the Chicago sports décor throughout the room. It has less of the touristy and restaurant chain touches / trappings of the more well-known Chicago deep dish spots.What Pequod's most excels at is their crust. It is a true pan pizza and has an exceptional caramelized crust. This caramelized crust does not just deliver a great crispiness to the pizza crust, but it also delivers a really addictive flavor. Pequod's burnt crust has the kind of distinction that Pizza Hut hopes to achieve with their pan pizza crust but does not.The sauce and toppings are all fine, but the center of the pizza has a lot of soft bread / crust, which keeps the pizza from being one of the best in the city.Service was fairly quick and friendly.Prices are okay given that the portions are generous and the pizza is so filling.I am not a huge deep dish pizza fan though it was nice to try a more local deep dish pizza spot in Chicago. It did not change my mind about deep dish pizza, but if you are a fan of deep dish pizza and live in the area, Pequod's is worth a try.I am not sure what the parking situation is, but it looked like there was free street parking in the area.",16,0,negative

Medium easily serves 3 people (and that's if they have big appetites). Mozzarella sticks were extra cheesy, stringy, and crunch on the outside. There's an attempt to do a sports bar theme but it's not totally cohesive. The music choice is cliche radio hits but that's all negligible in my overall rating of the place.",4,2,positive

I understand it's a sports bar with pride, but we didn't come during a big game, or during any game. There were maybe 6 other parties in the restaurant -- it was pretty obvious we were here as tourists just expecting genuine Chicago-style pizza.

987,"I'm a huge NY style/thin crust pizza person. I feel like you get so much more of the flavor that way. But, obviously, coming to Chicago, I had to give the authentic deep dish a try. Many recommended Pequod's as one of the best deep dish pizzas. We planned it out right by going in the late afternoon. We were able to get seated right away, but it still takes 45 minutes once you are seated to get the pizza. Imagine if you had to wait in line for 2 hours and then 45 minutes after getting seated? That's the norm for a place like this. We went with the regular cheese and added some green peppers. Didn't want to compromise the authentic cheesy taste too much by adding too much. The pizza was delicious and one medium was perfect for 3 people. Boy is it cheesy and bready. But, not too much bread as I was expecting. I liked how the crust was crisp, giving it more flavor and helping it stay together well. I think the crust was pretty memorable - they flavor it very well, and it's the perfect amount of crisp.. The cheesiness was exceptional, as you could see it as you pulled apart each piece, which you want with pizza, am i rite? Glad we were recommended this spot when visiting.

993,"So everyone always says if you are ever in Chicago try a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. On recommendations from a few friends people suggested to try out Pequod's Pizzeria. We hopped into a cab and came straight from our hotel which wasn't that far actually. While arriving here for dinner they told us it would take about 45 minutes and our name was on the list. So while waiting we just hanged outside since the place inside is literally super packed with all sorts of people. I was thinking of just getting a personal to share with me and my friend but on recommendations from the server she said we should get the 10 inch small size. The personal is a 7 inch pizza. Guess what we didn't even finish our pizza which always happens because one we don't eat a gang load and it was a total waste. I think personally when you tell a waitress that you aren't really hungry and want to just try something a personal would be fine. Especially since the crust is so thick and huge. It is like your eating a big piece of wet tomato bread. Hey I might be getting hated on for this but seriously I wasn't at all impressed, maybe it's because I like things on a smaller scale and that I feel a lot better if I do finish things!",8,2,negative

1009,"I LOVE their pizza -- my husband and I agree that it is hands-down the best deep-dish pizza we've had in Chicago. They caramelize the crust and it is wonderful.The star down is for wait-time when it's busy. They're really great when it's an off time and they're not busy. Super friendly and helpful, but they need to do something about how they handle customers during the busy times. They don't take reservations, instead they have a priority seating list that puts you at the top of the wait list when you arrive. When I went with a large-ish group, they told me we'd have about a 45 minute wait. It took about 90 minutes, and we had something scheduled (and paid for and reserved) right afterwards, so it was super stressful trying to get dinner before we went to our event, and we weren't even really able to enjoy ourselves -- just ordered a couple of pizzas, had a beer, and had to take off. So, not the best place to go for dinner if you have somewhere else to be later, but still good food.Like I said, when they're not busy, the experience is great. They always have a game on and have great food. The service staff makes great recommendations for beer when asked and the atmosphere fits in well with a sports bar -- a little dark on the inside, but all the better to watch a game, eat pizza, and have a drink. If you come with a large group, be prepared to be a little squished. They don't have a ton of room and are quite busy during the dinner hour.",17,2,positive

I usually don't write yelp reviews, but I felt it was necessary for this pizza. I ordered a half sausage with cheese and half spinach and mushroom with cheese deep dish pizza. If you like a deep dish pizza with 95 bread and no cheese or toppings, then this is where you want to order from. I don't know if they decide to not try on takeout orders, that's what I've heard, but this pizza was so bad, I needed to write a review. I felt ripped off. Please observe picture. I prefer uno's, due's, lou's, giordano's, and even dominos to pequods. Would probably never order myself again, but if my friends want to order pequods, I hope it will be better than this past pizza.",6,2,negative
1013,"Chicago is well known for their deep dish pizza but you would for sure be missing out if you didn't try Pequod's pan pizza. I could eat it all day, every day. The dough is thick and the perfect mixture of soft and firm. The sauce is not too chunky with vegetables (onions and tomatoes) and this comes from someone who hates chunky sauce. The crispy edges of the pan pizza is so good! The garlic bread was also scrumptious, as were the mozzarella sticks. One of my favorite Lincoln Park treasures :)",5,3,positive
1014,"I have eaten at Pequod's and have had it delivered.  Both are extremely delicious and the delivery enables one to not have to wait forever.  Their spinach/garlic pan is so delicious with the caramelized crust.  The last time it was delivered, the pizza seemed a bit doughy and I would have liked it to have more cheese/tomato sauce.  Perhaps it was a random occurrence since I don't remember Pequod's being super doughy like this before.  I have also tried their thin crust with basil and it is delicious.  I recommend Pequod's for both deep dish and thin crust.  All of their ingredients are well-done and they do not skimp on them.",7,0,positive

I don't know how they do it time after time but it's delicious and I'm addicted to it. The wait is WORTH IT. Also their pequods salad is a great addition to their pizza.

1019,"I am probably saying something that is considered sacrilegious in Chicago, but, in our household's opinion, Pequod's pizza is totally overrated. Aside from having to wait on hold for more than 15 minutes to try to get it ordered for delivery, the pizza we picked up had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The Italian sausage tasted like unseasoned ground beef and the tomato sauce had no flavor. Sorry for this, but this may the first pizza we have not finished and didn't want to save for leftovers.",1,0,negative

1023,"I've tried giordano's and pequod's now and I can see why people like both. However, I think I might choose pequod's over giordano's because of the way the crust is made. I liked that the crust was crunchy and the pizza was soft. I created my own toppings when I went and got mushroom, onions, and sausage. Choosing the toppings I think can also make or break the pizza flavors. It seems like this place is always busy so know that there will be a wait. I didn't know this because it was my first time there. But you can call ahead to have your name written down, and once you get there, they will move your name up to the top. So you do still have to wait, but it won't be like an hour. Once you place your order of pizza, know that it will take about an hour to make the pizza. So it's probably a good idea to order appetizer if your starving. I ordered the jalapeño poppers which were fantastic! Recommended to us by our server. It was just me and my bf that was there so we ordered an appetizer and a size small for pizza. Size small has 4 slices but keep in mind that it's a chunky slice. I was able to only eat 1 slice because It's so much going on in just 1 slice.",8,2,positive

I almost called over the waitress to say are you sure this is what a piece of cheesecake should look like"" but judging by our table request, we didn't bother. So, busy, loud space, good pizza, expensive tiny dessert. Lots of our friends love it, so maybe it was just an off day.",9,4,negative

1028,"Went to this place after Cubs game- here's my first impression as I walked in- DIRTY! Staff looked exhausted although it was end of night. Pizza wait was 40 minutes although person at bar said he had been waiting over an hour... not that many people in restaurant, maybe heavy carry out causing wait time? I had a Italian sausage, with sweet peppers. Ok this may possibly have been the worst Italian sausage I've ever had- it resembled beef jerky- the peppers, nearly raw- warmed up is how I would describe- bread was way to big not a sausage roll- friend had meatball sandwich, as I write this it's 7:30 am 8.5 hours later and he's puking- the meatball sandwich was ridiculous- it looked like they started making a pizza then realized it was a sandwich? I know this is a pizza place first but come on if you mess up a simple sandwich how good can the pizza be? I mean seriously. My guess this place is frequented by people right out of college that were eating Dominos pizza for the past 5 years in college. The older group probably ate there years ago wandered in and realized the pizza wasn't as good as they thought. My guess is that if any of you 4 star reviewers took a tour of that kitchen you'd drive straight to Cosco to buy a pallet of toilet paper cause you'll surely need it.. I agree that Lou's is way ahead of this place-oven grinder another good place as I remember although haven't been there in a while, might feel the same way- I like well lit restaurants that don't have a wad of gum sitting on bar when I sit down. Maybe I hit this place on a bad night- I doubt it though... The bartender was very nice, she gladly took our money with a big smile-",10,4,negative

1037,"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. My family and I came to the restaurant back in July because a lot of people we spoke to recommended Pequods over Giordano's and Lou Malnati's, let's just say they couldn't be more wrong. The experience from start to finish was one of the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. We waited over 3 hours for a table of 10. At first I didn't mind the wait because we were a large party but by the time it was 12am and we were still waiting it was kind of insane. When they finally called our table we were seated upstairs and while walking upstairs we noticed the entire restaurant was empty. I think maybe one or two parties were left but there were so many tables available i couldn't believe they took so long to seat us. By the time they seated us we put in our order right away and then waited another hour for the pizza, for 4 pies of pizza! At that point we had been waiting for 4 hours, 3 hours to sit then another hour to eat. It was 1230am and I decided to ask one of the waitresses why the pizza was taking so long, she looked up at me and said ""don't you see I'm folding boxes, I'm busy, I can't help you."" I understand she wasn't our waitress but it wouldn't have been so hard to say ""sorry if you give me one second I'll grab your server and she can help you."" Anyways, to top it all off, when our pizza finally did come it was the most mediocre of pizzas I've ever had. There was no cheese, the entire pizza was just dough, I wouldn't call it a deep dish or actually a pizza really.I wouldn't waste time coming to any of their locations. Lou Malnatis and Giordanos were far better in my opinion and there's no sassy waitress folding boxes there.",5,6,negative
1038,"Not a fan. I like deep dish pizza, just not Pequod's crust. It is a biscuit like dough and very dry and crumbly in my opinion. Caramelized cheese was nice but not enough to compensate.",4,0,negative
1039,All time favorite pizza in the city and maybe even ever... it's amazing! The crust is doughy in the middle and crunchy on the bottom and the caramelized cheese on the edge is the best part. Also has a great cheese and sauce ratio. If you go before 5 you usually don't have to wait but go any later and it can be up to 2 hours BUT you can wait at the bar and get som pre pizza drinks.,4,0,positive
1040,"Good place, really. Comfy room and great service. I can't find a single thing to complain about, but I have a hard time coming up with a big compliment either. The pizza was good, but not exciting. The charred edges of the crust were nice but the dough to toppings ratio here is a little bread heavy for my taste. I enjoyed it and have no complaints, but it's hard to come up with anything that impressed me overall. The people were nice, but not overwhelming. Bottom line, don't be afraid to visit this place. You'll enjoy it. It's a good spot with good people. You probably won't find yourself raving to your friends about it later though.",11,6,positive
1041,"I've ordered at the restaurant and also have had delivery, both very similar in the quality of food! In my opinion, is superior than Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno, Gina's or Giordano's.

1042,"I was really excited to try Pequod's after all the hype I've heard since moving back to the city.  Perhaps I'm old fashioned, perhaps I'm no longer hip, but I thought that other than the delicious burned cheese crust - the pizza was just average.  It's certainly not up to the level of many other less-trendy deep dish spots in the city.  I suppose to each his own, but I'm glad to have tried it on day there wasn't much of a wait - If I had waited an hour for pizza like this, I would have been very disappointed.",4,3,negative

1046,"While in Chicago, we were on the hunt for the best deep dish. We only had a chance to try two, so I can't compare Pequod's to all the other deep dishes of Chicago. With so many different places at our disposal, we went with Pequod's because of the solid reviews. Although it wasn't our favorite of the trip, we still thought it was good! The small (10"") was more than enough food for two. It's cool that you can do half toppings here, we loaded it up with veggie toppings for me and meat for the meat eater. I couldn't really taste the cheesy crust, and to be honest prefer Lou Malnati's crust a bit more. We came at an obscure time and there was no wait. It's a bit of a trek, but it's worth checking out if you're like us and want to check out the best of Chicago.",11,1,positive

It took a minute for our server to greet us and we weren't really checked on much, until we requested for the check. I really enjoyed the pizza though! Crispy crust and it was soft and hearty with toppings on the top -- I really liked it. Definitely the type of pizza to put you in a coma. I wanted to ask for extra sauce on the side because the pizza is quite bread-y but as I mentioned above, we did not receive much service.",5,0,positive
1050,"Hands down, Pequod's is the best Chicago deep dish. Pequod's is always a staple of my Chicago trips. I always try to eat there at least once while I am in town. The first couple times I was in Chicago, I did the touristy thing and went to Giordano's, etc. I did not know about the Holy Grail of Chicago pizza yet. A friend of mine told me I was missing out and needed to stay away from the tourist trap pizza places and experience true Chicago pizza. I had high expectations for my first time when I went to Pequod's, and they definitely were met and exceeded! I was not disappointed. If you go on a weekend, you should expect a wait, unless you utilize the call ahead seating that they offer. The pizza does take some time to make, but it is expected. Their pizza is actually true deep dish pizza, with the perfect combination of dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. (Instead of having loads of cheese and toppings filled with a thin layer of dough.) I can't even put in words how amazing the flavor is, especially with the caramelized cheese on the crust! That's probably one of my favorite parts!!! The atmosphere is great inside as well, especially to watch your favorite team. Lots of televisions and you will have a view of multiple screens from wherever you are seated. I was impressed with how reasonable the price was at Pequod's as well. If you haven't had Pequod's deep dish yet, you need to go try it ASAP. It will change your life and you will not want to eat any other Chicago deep dish ever again.",11,2,positive
1051,Got pick up from here last night. Not too bad but the thin crust was a little too doughy for my liking. The pizza had a unique flavor to it which was pretty good. The wings sauce was good but ruined by soggy wings. I wish people wouldnt leave wings submerged in a gallon of hot sauce. It takes a way the crispiness. otherwise this was not a bad first experience,5,3,negative
1052,"Ok so this review is based on delivery. The pizza is amazing. My favorite pizza in the city. However, delivery is not what it uses to be. I initially called at 6:10pm today to place an order. I followed the prompts and was on hold listening to some awful music for 20 min. 20 minutes. Unreal. Then the music stops, and I get pushed to voicemail! The fact I even stayed on hold that long showcases how much I love this pizza. I call back and decide to choose the pick up prompt, which resulted in me speaking to someone right away. I advised what happened and instead of saying they will look into it, she said she could take my order herself. Had I known this I wouldn't have waited for 20 minutes.Now the fun part. I got my order taken, was told it would be here in about 1.5 hours (8:05pm). Pizza didn't come until 8:30. That is 2 hours of waiting. That's a bit ridiculous in my opinion. I'm not that far away, there was no rain, and traffic around 8pm isn't really heavy. I ended up calling the store asking if anything had happened because it's been 2 hours. The girl who answered said to call back in 10 minutes if the pizza didn't come. I mean, shouldn't this be addressed at that moment in time, regardless? What is 10 minutes after 2 hours of waiting?!?!? Customer service should have been better. I should have been given to a manager to discuss. Had I known I'd be eating at 8:30pm I would have ordered somewhere else, eaten by 730pm (at a normal hour).Pizza came lukewarm, not hot. Normally, I would say something, but I was so hungry from not having had anything to eat all day that I just said forget it. They won't do anything anyways- they didn't do anything when I told them I've been waiting over 2 hours and the pizza guy was 30 min late. For the price, I would have expected a little better customer service. I order pizza all the time and come in very frequently, so this experience makes me a little weary of ordering delivery from here. Maybe it's best to go sit at the store, and hope not to be stuck upstairs on the summer where it feels like 100 degrees!I want to emphasize that I called at 610 in order to beat the rush and be able to get my dinner by 730. Unfortunately, it's 9pm and I just finished. I'll report back if pequods reaches out. I'm not really holdingy breath though.",11,4,negative
1053,"The best pizza in Chicago. The best location is in Morton Grove. If someone tells you Lou Malnatis is the best, than they are a fake and don't understand real pizza.

Make sure you call in advance because the pizza takes over an hour to cook, and don't worry about ordering too much the leftovers taste even better. Enjoy.",4,3,positive

We ordered a pizza to go because the wait was over an hour and it's too crowded to wait inside and not a great waiting space. I was sorely disappointed by the deep dish and it was the worst deep dish I have had. The crust was really dry and there was a few dollops of cheese but mostly dry bread with sauce. I'm not sure if it was an off night since it seems like most people seem to like it, but definitely not what I expected.

Ordered ahead and used the text service to expedite our meal. The pizza came out within the time they said, however it was soggy and watery. The sauce was not seasoned at all and the pizza at all was flavorless. However, the one fantastic part of the pizza was the caramelized cheese crust which was delicious. Rest of the pizza was awful. Thankfully, the server spoke to the manager and they took the pizza off our bill. Unfortunately, both me and my companion got food poisoning from the single slices we ate. I will try Pequods again as I'm hoping it was just our bad luck that our pizza was terrible.",6,3,negative
1063,For 15 years I have gotten great takeout pizza from Pequods. Last night my wife and I chose to actually eat in at the restaurant. It was not at all crowded (that is unusual) but a large sign at the greeter's table warned of a 40 minute wait (at least) if you dared order pizza -deep dish or thin crust.  The greeter did say we could get slices in ten minutes. Slices came in about 20 minutes burned up and singed. 1/2 order of spaghetti ordered with cheese came quickly with a mountain of cheese burying a tiny bit of spaghetti and a small single meatball (for $2.95 additional). Unrecognizable as a small spaghetti dinner. One of the worst  restaurant meals I've  ever had!We'll go back to ordering take out pizza from Pequods.,1,5,negative
1064,"I went on Sunday with some friends and the waiting was wait too long. We asked our pan pizza to go because we though that it would take less time that if we wait for a table at the restaurant. But it wasn't like that. They told us that we had to wait for 1:15 hours, and we were waiting there for 2 hours. It was really frustrating because they were telling us that they were checking our order, but they were not doing it. Finally, one of the workers appeared 45 minutes later than our original waiting time with our order and other 10 more orders. Our biggest surprise was that when we arrived home 5 minutes later and we ate the pizza it was not that good like if you eat it in the restaurant. The crust wasn't crunchy like it should be, and the pizza was kind of cold. We use to go to this restaurant a lot to eat the best pan pizza in Chicago, but now I don't know if we will come back.",5,2,negative

The wait was around 45 minutes and pizza is super doughy and doesn't have much cheese, and I would have expected the ""caramelized crust"" that they are known for to be more than just the edges.

1070,"It is a nice cozy neighborhood Pizzeria.  I have lived in Chicago most of my life and can say that I have frequented many, many other establishments.   We ordered a thin pepperoni large pizza which was tasty.  It arrived in a timely manner.  The service was ok.  The staff is mainly female (at least from what I could see that day).  We sat at the bar because my out of town friend was starving and did not want to wait a minute longer.  I was surprised that on this particular night (weeknight) it was not busy at all.  The female staff seemed to be more interested in talking to my male friend which I found to be very disrespectful and unprofessional.  Luckily, this is a friend otherwise he would have been replaced very quickly if he was a significant other.  Like I said, the attention was toward him that I did not even or was asked if I wanted any water.  The bar area where we sat was dirty and sticky and no one bothered to even wipe it down.  It gave me a sick feeling so I barely touched or leaned up against it.  I took a few bites of the pizza which I said was tasty.  I guess my friend could tell that I was unhappy by the look on my face that decided to eat as fast as he could and leave the place.  If I were to order pizza from this place again I would definitely order it to go.  Parking was not difficult to find, but with so many other pizza joints in this great city, it will be a while before I head over to this place and order their famous pizza.",7,7,positive
1071,"Probably the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Visited Chicago and had to visit this place. Waited about 1.5 hours for a party of 2 on a Saturday night. I wish that they'd allow ordering before seating so that it's ready the the time the table is. Sadly, it takes 45 minutes from time of ordering to receiving the pizza. But it is so worth it! The caramelized crust makes it a masterpiece. Definitely visiting again when I'm in town",4,0,positive

1074,"We stopped in after a Cubs game on a Saturday around 515 place wasn't that crowded we got a seat right away . The inside is small and hot . The pizza was good , not amazing like I have read . They have a ton of workers with Pequods shirts on walking around , and multiple girls came back to check on us and refill our drinks . So we weren't really sure who our server was . Very small menu , but we went for the deep dish pizza . It was a nice Saturday dinner in the city, if we are in the area again we will stop by .They do have a call ahead seating option , your not guaranteed to be seated right away but if they are busy I would do this option on the way there . I also heard if you order a pickup and decide to stay and eat they seat you fairly quickly. There is street parking (which is hard to get ) but also a Parking garage across the street .",8,2,positive

Will never order takeout from them again.",0,2,negative
1079,"Forget Giordano's, forget Home Run Inn, forget Lou Malnati's, forget Gino's East. Pequod's puts them all to shame. Hands-down, best pizza I've ever had. There's usually a massive wait (especially during Cubs games), and pizzas take an hour to cook, but it is absolutely worth it. The sauce is rich and spicy, and the crust has the perfect amount of crunch to it. Don't get it delivered, though. It completely alters the texture of the crust to a mushy substance. If you do have to get it delivered, order it uncut, and throw it in a hot oven for a few minutes to firm the crust back up. The one thing they could do better is their delivery system. They're very unaccommodating with their delivery zone, and it can take over two hours to get your food. (I've been told by a driver that they keep a short staff of drivers.)",6,1,positive

1085,"hmmm... i don't know.  either we went on an off night, or this place is supremely hyped up.  i honestly don't know if we went on an off night, because people were waiting outside to be seated.  long story short, it took over an hour to get our pizza, and once the pizza arrived, the bottom was burnt and there was not enough cheese. maybe i'm holding this place to such a high standard, but i should right??? Michelin recommend this place, and you know if they recommend it... it has to be good. the crust and bread holding the pizza was just too thick and the sauce was kinda lacking.  the price for a small pizza is roughly 12 bucks, and toppings are an extra 2 bucks.   not to mention, parking is almost impossible to find on the streets, so you'll have to park across the street at he movie theater lot for 10 bucks. =/ i was going in with high hopes, but this place fell short of them.",6,2,negative

As others noted, there was too much crust with respect to the toppings/cheese. Although the crust did taste decent. The quality of the veggie toppings was meh. And lastly I was not a fan of the caramelized crust. I appreciate them trying to do something a little bit different, but it just came across as weird. At the end of the day, there are other deep dish restaurants I prefer. I'm glad I checked this out though.",6,2,negative

1093,"Nice little spot to drop by after a drink filled night in Wicker Park. Stopped by to grub on some deep dish when we found out they close at 2 AM. I was pleasantly surprised that it resembled more of a dive bar than a pizzeria. Being on vacation in Chicago and being that it was my last night, I had to have me some Deep Dish Deliciousness. Unknown to me, they served pizza by the slices, which was to come out a lot faster if you didn't want to wait for a deep dish. Did my inebriated self want to wait an hour for a deep dish? Sadly, my impatience got the better of me.I went with a simple slice of pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza while my girlfriend wanted a white pesto pizza. The server told us my order wouldn't be a problem to make for a slice but we'll have to order a a full pizza for my gf's order. Not a problem...if my slice didn't take as long as her mini white pesto deep dish to come out. What was probably 35 minutes, my slice finally came out. Perfect size for my hungry drunk ass and loaded with toppings. It was better than I expected. My only gripe? The sauge, or shall we call them meat balls, were a little too big and over powering, making the pepperoni and mushroom irrelevant. Luckily, them balls were packed with flavor. Just wish they were smaller in size so I can taste the other toppings. Not before I was 1/4 through my pizza, my gf's pizza came out. If I knew my slice would take almost as long as my gf's order I would've just went with a classic deep dish. We rarely got checked on and had to wave down the servers a couple times to get water refills. Besides that, the servers were very friendly. If we ever stop by Chicago again, I'd definitely like to try what people are saying is the best deep dish in Chicago.",8,3,negative
1094,"Deep dish pizza, yum! I came here with a friend on a weekend for lunch around 11:30AM, and there was no wait. There was a wait, however, for the pizza to come out; I hear it's pretty typical though. We ordered a small pizza with spinach, mushroom, bell pepper, and pepperoni. The sauce wasn't very flavorful and towards the middle, the crust got soggy. For the most part though when the pizza first came out, the bottom of the crust was crunchy which was nice! I really enjoyed it. The outer crust was my favorite part though; it was a bit burnt and it was super crunchy and delicious! Good place to eat, I would definitely recommend it. The bill came out to be around $11 post-tax, which I don't know whether is typical or not for deep dish. Delicious though!",7,0,positive
1095,"When I called ahead I was told that they would not put the pizza in until we were here. I thought, wow they must deal with a lot of sketchy people. Then when we got here they told us that the pizza won't be started until we were seated. It took 15 minutes for them to seat us. They put us upstairs where they have one waitress for 20 tables. They let us know that the pizza would be 40 minutes. We have been here an hour. Our waitress came to the table and apologized that they ""lost"" our order and that it will be an additional 20 minutes. The waitress just came to ask if we wanted to order additional food! Um, no, we'd not like to spend more money here! We'd like what we called ahead for.",3,1,negative

1097,"In a town know for deep dish and never changing the deep dish prerequisites, Pequod's stands out for making a great pie while diverging from the run of the mill pie's you'll find elsewhere. Easily taking the crown as my favorite Chicago deep dish, Pequod's excels exactly where the others, in my own humble opinion, have failed: refreshing a Chicago staple. The pies are deep but not so much that one slice fills you up. The crust is perfectly golden brown but allows the toppings to take top billing. If Pequod's wanted to improve, the only recommendation I could proffer is to open another location or expand their delivery radius to River North!!",10,1,positive
1098,"Loved it! I think it's a tie between Pequod's and Giordano's for me. It's everything you'd expect if you're craving the usual deep dish pizza. Giordano's is more of a ""fancy"" deep dish in my opinion. While Pequod's focuses more on the crust, Giordano's is more about the toppings and cheese (which can be overwhelming and super rich). Both are great. I liked the atmosphere on the 2nd floor. Seemed like a dive bar. I'm surprised they don't have more locations in the downtown area!",6,0,positive
1099,"Just how do they do it?  How does this place achieve deep dish pizza perfection?After some research, I found out some of the secrets.  First is the cast iron pizza pans, well-seasoned after many years of use.  Next is the dough, spread in a thick layer on the bottom of the oiled pizza pain, but not up the sides.  The cheese is whole mild mozzarella, sliced in house to exact specifications, and laid in overlapping pattern on top of the crust but, and here's one of the secrets, also placed up on the sides of the pan.  A hefty ladle of uncooked seasoned tomato sauce goes on top, followed by toppings, dried oregano and pecorino romano cheese.  The thing bakes for about 20 minutes in a 600 degree oven.  The result?  The crust has a beautiful lacy caramelized ring around it, the sauce is sweet and tangy with great depth of flavor, and the toppings are charred to great effect.It's deep dish pizza perfection!  Hard. To. Stop. Eating. It.The only downside is that it's busy and the wait is long.  On a rainy Saturday at 1:30 pm, we waited about 45 minutes to get in, and then it took another 45 minutes to get our pizza after we sat down.  Don't fret, your patience will be rewarded!",10,3,positive
1100,"I don't get the hype....I found Pequod's totally overrated. Full disclosure: not a hater of deep dish, but strongly prefer thin crust. Regardless, I did not find the pizza that tasty. Didn't like the biscuity quality to the crust and didn't think the sauce, pepperoni or sausage was that tasty. I'm not going to advertise for other pizza joints in this review, but there is much better pizza to be had in Chicago. I did like the carmelized cheese on the crust, but this barely tasted like pizza to me, it was like some generic Italian-ish pot pie w/out enough garlic/herbs/flavor. All it was was filling. I tried it, it did nothing to make deep dish more appealing to me.",8,2,negative
1101,"The atmosphere was nice and so were the employees, however the thin crust pizza slices I ordered were over priced for what I received. This pizza does not adhere to the standards I hold Chicago pizza to. If you are high as a kite and need some warm food in your belly before you sack out then this joint could be for you. The staff, atmosphere and late night hour is what this place has going for it but you want to go here for a slice of pizza(it's in the name) for a comparable price. I would not recommend to others.",3,1,negative

Best luck at no wait is off hours or before 5PM.

Beware of Cubs games because overflow tends to find itself there after games.",3,1,negative
1103,Absolutely amazing pizza!  Crust was incredibly crispy and that caramelized cheese...drool...We actually didn't have to wait long for a table on a Friday night (Tip: use their priority wait seating on their website!  It's not really a reservation but they'll put you on the front of their wait list once you arrive).,2,0,positive

We walked in a few minutes after they open, and there were already a few customers inside... a good sign.Took about an hour which is reasonable, so we ordered a half order of fries to keep us entertained (yum and cheap). A ""small"" pizza has only 4 slices but is definitely enough to feed two people. That delicious smell of freshly made pizza, the cheese string lasting forever, the toppings are big and juicy. and stuffed at capacity. The crust is solid... crispy crunchy almost cookie like. The sides are baked with caramelized cheese and is almost 4 inches high. Very satisfying.Staff was friendly and was great at helping us customize our perfect pizza!",10,2,positive

1115,"Now that I've tried most of this city's popular pizza joints, I feel like I can put each one into their own category. By far Giordano's is still my favorite because they have a fierce gooey cheese game going on in their pies. Lou's tends to be more saucy, while here we found it to be overly bready.On our first visit we tried the thin crust which we enjoyed, so we were very excited to get their famous deep dish with an all cheese crust, which is phenomenal by the way. Who knew burnt cheese could taste so good? The pizza seemed to be a good inch of bread high with a layer of sauce and toppings as opposed to more of a deep dish where the bottom layer of dough is thinner and the toppings deeper and more plentiful. It still tastes great sure, but everyone has a preference. My husband likes Lou's the best which is why we were hoping to have this be our new favorite and could that way compromise and eat here when we were in town. I like that it has the feel of a local sports bar and the service was stellar. Our waitress comped one of my husband's beers for taking a long time to come out when we hadn't even noticed or brought it up which I thought was completely awesome and unnecessary. Still do come here and try it to decide for yourself which pizza suits your fancy. The toppings are fresh, the flavors on point, and you certainly won't leave hungry! They also have great lunch specials and you can call ahead and put your name down during high wait times.",21,2,positive

I did not care for it because it lack seasoning and the dough was not well done for me and I needed to add salt on my pizza.  I never add salt to my food but yes the pizza was under salted.  The only thing that I totally disliked were the hostesses.  The one that had glasses was loosing control and was yelling at all of us to get into a single file and had to be helped to mange the buzzers you received to be called to your table.  After over an biy and half we finally got our table they took us upstairs and a hostess with braids was so rude she was taking us so fast up the stairs my cldey sick mother was exhausted and could not catch up to her.  So by the time we got sited at our table the hostess rudely slam the forks, knives in a cup on the table and walked off.   That ruin my appetite.  Set the ambiance from 5 states to 3 No am definitely NOT coming back not worth the wait",11,5,negative

1124,"My first Chicago style deep dish pizza did not disappoint! The place is pretty divey and unapologetically so. Since the pizza itself was going to take about 30-40 minutes, we ordered their cheese bread to start. The cheese bread is almost artery clogging with the amount of cheese that they put on it and was the perfect size to share between three people without being too much. We ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and basil pizza. The crust came out looking like it was burnt but it was just how they caramelized cheese. The crust itself was very crispy on the outside while fluffy and doughy on the inside. The addition of the caramalized/burnt cheese was definitely my favorite part of the pizza and was quite addicting! The pepperoni was pretty standard and I liked their sausage a lot better because it was more flavorful. The only real downside is that the pizza was mainly a really thick crust. Though it was tasty, I could only really get through one whole slice before being sent into a carb-induced food coma. Once we got over the intial wow-factor of the crispy cheese, we mainly picked away at the toppings of our next slices.Overall, I think Pequod's was a great introduction to Chicago deep dish for me and I can't wait to try other spots to be able to compare!",8,3,positive

Ever since I discovered the deliciousness that is Pequod's, it's not just the only pizza place I take friends too, it's where I like to go whenever I'm in the mood for a really good pizza pie. It's not deep dish. It's deep-pan pizza so, while the pizza is two inches thick, most of that is crust instead of normal deep dish sludge. And the caramelized crust is amazeballs. I was surprised how divey it felt when I first walked in but I like that they let their food speak for itself. The cheesy garlic bread is a solid starter, and they typically have pretty good drink specials. I've actually never had to wait too long to get seated, but I've also usually been able to avoid prime dinner time. The one time I had to wait at all, I was able to grab a drink at the bar next door while I waited for my buzzer, so no harm no foul.",6,3,positive

The pizza takes about 40 minutes to come out, so I recommend ordering right away. The cheese is crispy, the toppings are on point, and the crust requires a fork and knife for sure.I do really like the atmosphere, which is like a cool locals bar.

We (all five of us who are all long time Deep Dish fans) were NOT disappointed. Great pie! The crust, the ingredients including the sausage and cheese are top quality. The sauce is excellent with a slight tangy while the acidity is low and cooked out. Going forward when visiting ""My Kind of Town"", I'll now have pan pizza on two different nights. One night at Lou's and one night at Pequad's  (not necessarily in that order).  Expect to wait during peak hours but it's worth the effort! Very reasonably priced as well!",10,1,positive

They have a lunch special during the weekdays from 11:00am to 3pm for $4.95 so I would recommend ordering that. You can get a personal pan pizza with a fountain drink for the price, which is very reasonable. The quantity is sufficient too for one person but you can even share it. My friends and I ordered an extra one to go as well.",5,0,positive
1133,"Hahahah, Pequods.You like deep dish? You like this place.I think the overly-detailed bad reviews are hilarious. This is not burger king. You do not get it your way. You get it Pequods way, and sometimes, you have to just take it that way.But I am not here to talk about how long it took to get my food, nor if the server was rude to me, or if your box had a dent in it. I am here to talk about how the food put in front of me was, which is really what we should all be talking about.",3,3,positive
1134,"My favorite deep dish pizza ever. You just can't beat Peaquod's: quality ingredients, good sauce/cheese/toppings ratio, and the perfect level of char. I know the charred aspect isn't a favorite for everyone, but I think it completes the pizza and makes it into the perfect Pequod's crust. I've been here several times and the service is kind of hit or miss, but fortunately for them, their pizza is so good that I keep coming back regardless. If you're coming in from out of town and you want deep dish, THIS IS IT. Also try your fav topping with giardinera (spicy food lovers only)... thank me later. :)",9,0,positive

1139,"A huge disappointment. There was wait which I don't understand why when majority of the second floor was empty; we were seated upstairs. What is up with people and deep dishes? I was excited to travel to Chicago to finally try the famous deep dish pizza and that was a huge mistake; the grumpy guy that sat across me couldn't agree any less. We had the small pan pizza with onion, pepper, mushroom, basil, pineapple and some other greens. It wasn't bad looking but the taste...he finished his slice and I couldn't even stuff another bite. I think I ate a total of 2.5 bites of my slice and doggie bagged the rest for my mommie. Mom didn't like it either. We also ordered the appetizer combo that came with mozzarella sticks, zucchini slices, jalapeño poppers, and breaded mushrooms. I was super excited for the mozzarella sticks because I can't remember how old I was when I had it; probably in high school. I can't say it fulfilled my craving for mozzarella sticks but it was definitely one of the better appetizers. Everything else was being ingested out of hunger. We also ordered the garlic bread and wow were we upset. It wasn't garlicy or buttery. Hmm. This is a tough review. I feel like it's suppose to be good but I had such a bad experience with the food.",10,5,negative
1140,"I really like the pizza here. I've only had the deep dish. Also have had salad and apps there which were fine but nothing special. My boyfriend has gotten a pasta dish and thought it was good but nothing to write home about. The pizza has a caramelized crust which I've heard some people think is too much of a burnt flavor, which I can understand. It's up to your personal preference whether you will love the pizza or not. The service is just ok, and I've ordered it for delivery which was not a good experience. They messed up on my delivery time and tried to deliver it when I wasn't there, so came back about an hour later after completing more deliveries. I had to microwave the pizza once it arrived and the fries we got were soggy. I would go back for the pizza, but would not do delivery again.",5,0,positive

1142,"This was the least flavorful ""deep dish"" pizza I've ever experienced. The deep dish was more ""pan pizza"" and less deep dish. The sauce was in dire need of salt, the crust was soggy and the meat lacked any flavor at all. Where was the cheese? Several people recommended this restaurant over my favorite Giodarnos and over Lou Malnatis, but I'm convinced they lacked tastebuds. The only positive was our waitress Tessa, who was polite and attentive. I was otherwise, beyond disappointed.",5,2,negative

Because we were traveling internationally and had card issues with fraud alerts, she was kind enough to make our order happen while we sorted out our credit card situation. Had she not done this in order to facilitate our order, we would have probably never tried (or gone back to) her establishment.For the record- we were a late night order, so time was of the essence.Much appreciate her faith in us, and let it be known that- given how great her service was, and delicious the pizza is- we shall now be regular customers, having recently moved here and this being our first pizza order in Chicago. Thank you, Brenda!",8,1,positive
1145,"This really needs no help with a rating. I will tho, since I see some disgruntled NY and other folks who live out of town have given lower ratings. The crust is always just the right amount of crisp and done. It's a deep dish pizza done correctly, where others fail. The toppings are always tasty. I've never had it soggy, its always been slightly burnt, like their signature, and perfectly done thru the rest.So Fort Worth, Miami, Anh (real trendy spelling) and dorky Jake from SF, just stay in your respective smellier cities.",6,2,positive

1148,"It was a new experience for me to tell people all across the city that I'd had pizza, and when they asked ""where at"" I said ""Pequod's"" and the response was *universal* approval. ""You won't find better in the city. Good job."" It was almost as if people were surprised that I, some guy from Vegas, would be able to divine the local secrets of Chicago pizza. This place was awesome. That's the important part. Second most important: you're going to wait for it. We put our names in and went down the street to a bar they had partnered with to wait, instead of just sitting around waiting for a table in the actual restaurant. They gave us a buzzer and we started drinking. About 80 minutes later, the buzzer went off and we headed back to our table. We ordered garlic cheese bread for starters, and it was pretty good. I'd give it 4 stars if I had to grade the bread alone. It was still good, no doubt, the bread could have been a bit better if I had to pick one thing to improve. After we ordered our pizzas, one thick and one thin crust, we waited again and ate our garlic cheese bread and drank our drinks.The pizzas arrived. I'm not a big fan of Chicago-style deep dish. I consider myself a thin-crust man. The thin crust is thicker than I expected, more of a ""pan"" style, ""normal"" thickness. The deep dish was exactly what I expected. Even though I'm not a deep dish person, I ate two pieces and had to stop myself from having a third lest I leave no room for the thin crust. The thin crust was excellent, and the thickness was deceiving: it was crisp and delicious even though a bit airy. I am a big fan of both these pizzas. The toppings tasted great, the sauce was great, the service was pretty good. I'd come here again in a heartbeat. And I understand why everybody was so happy for me when I told them I'd come here.",19,3,positive
1149,"I have always heard people talking about pequods so when I came to eat here with a bunch of friends I was so hyped. We even brought some friends that were visiting from Florida. The place was packed so I thought it was a good sign. We ordered the sausage with pepperoni, pepperoni sausage with jalapeño, and canadian bacon with pineapple. After we ate I felt so bad for bringing my out of town friends. It was so meh. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't good. Good thing Florida pizza is trash so pequods was ok to them. The atmosphere is fun but it gets so packed that sometimes it's hard to get a hold of your server. But when u do they are nice and helpful.",5,4,negative
1150,"Always have their amazing pizza when I can. Love the lunch deals and I love the burnt cheese crust. The wait is typically pretty long but it is definitely worth it for this pizza. I am the kind of person who does come here during the less crowded times. Make sure you go during lunch for the 4.95 lunch special. Also there is a bar next door where you can have a drink while you wait. The buzzer will work in there while you wait. I do like sitting on the second floor better as it does feel cozier, especially for how long you have to wait, and they service I get up there is typically better. The past few times I have been here the servers have not been too warm and welcoming and it looked like they were just fed up by the huge crowds and lines. Us customers just can't help it when the cooks make this pizza so addictive so we keep coming. This is definitely a local mostly location and the best place in my opinion for deep dish in Chicago. This is coming from someone who doesn't pizzadiscriminate.",11,1,positive

1153,"Well, this was a flat-out disappointment.I'd been hearing great things about Pequod's for years:  Hell, since before I even knew Yelp existed.  Now, I'm no Chicago deep-dish junkie--the dreadful Chicago-style place in my hometown kept me away from the stuff for years--but I've now visited the city enough times to have had several of these pizzas that I thought were terrific.  From what I gathered over time, Pequod's was supposed to be one of the two or three best.  To judge by the pie we had on this night, it fell sadly short of expectations.  The crust:  One-dimensionally crunchy and virtually flavorless.The sauce:  Insipid and bland.The veggie toppings:  Hacked up in unpleasantly large bites.  (The sausage was pretty good, though.)That heralded caramelized crust was pretty great, but it could not make up for the rest of this mediocrity of a pizza.Maybe this was just a dud, a bad night.We liked everything else about Pequod's:  The casual, cramped, old-school feel of the place; the friendly, if somewhat relaxed, service; the solid Italian salad we shared as an appetizer (very good housemade dressing); and the beer list.One day, I'd like to give Pequod's another shot.",14,7,negative
1154,"Came here on the suggestion of different locals. Left supremely disappointed. The pizza was not deep dish, which is what we expressed that we wanted when Pequads was suggested.

We ended up picking Pequod's.We came on a Friday evening and had an approximately two hour wait. Luckily, there's a Barnes and Noble nearby to pass the time. After getting seated, we ordered a medium pizza, which was the perfect size for three, with fresh basil, sausages, and mushrooms. The basil seemed to be lacking in both quantity and flavor, but the other two toppings complemented the pizza really well! The crust of Pequod's pizza is also to die for and was yummy.",4,1,positive

We had one drink there before our table was ready. We had the cheesy garlic bread and created our own pizza. The cheesy garlic bread was great, and while I am not the biggest fan of deep dish pizza, it was still some of the best that I have had! It would have been nice if they had taken our order when we first got there and were waiting, as once we got seated upstairs it was about another hour until we got our pizza.

I will never eat here again. I'd rather spin month at a place that might not taste as good but have enough good sense, not to lose my order.

1160,Pequod's is a rock solid pizza and I've been going there for 25 years. It's a bit of a wait most of the time so come early grab a beer and most importantly order in advance so you can sit down and eat your pizza right away instead of having to wait for your pizza order once you finally sit down. The pizza crust is crispy although I admit it could use a little salt. Thin crust is what my son likes. When you can hook a 13 year old on good pizza it creates an experience he'll have his entire life. Speaking of experience the place has a lot of character. Good place to take a date or a family!,4,0,positive

1164,"Before anyone gets outraged for the 1 star rating, this review is only for their veggie pizza. I got a pan pizza while my friend got the thin crust one and both of them were so disappointing, the thin crust slightly less so. It looked like raw unseasoned veggies were just added on top of a cheese pizza. The pizza sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce. The only thing good about the pan pizza was the crust. Rightly done, I am sure this pizza could have been amazing. It took us 30 mins to get a table and additional 30 minutes before the pizza was brought out. So not worth the time or money if you are a vegetarian.",6,1,negative

1169,"I waited to review Pequod's until I had many others under my belt (85+ at this point). I remember loving it about two years ago when I first had it; before I knew anything about the hype. You can argue who has the best deep dish in Chicago, but I want to put a spin on this. If you look at the menu, they call this ""pan"" pizza and I'm glad they do, because I'd consider them the best pan pizza in Chicago, not deep dish. What I'm trying to say is pan pizza is known to be over-compensated on the dough. This is a very doughy pizza. I consider deep dish more balanced with more cheese and toppings and less dough. To each their own. I really like the airiness of the crust. It has a well-cooked bottom crunch, yet a chewy center. The sauce is more savory and is a true sauce, not chunk tomatoes. I hate to say it, but the sausage tasted a little dry and gritty. This is more than likely due to it being cooked on top of the pizza. There was a decent amount of cheese. It was enough, but wouldn't have complained if there was more. Of course I have to mention the caramelized cheese crust. This is the best bite of the pizza and what they are famous for. Don't be alarmed, it does not taste burnt at all! I also got a thin crust pizza. It's nice that they do a braided outer crust. The toppings were abundant and the it was far more cheesy than the pan pizza. I really liked the thin crust. I think everyone should at least get Pequods once to say they did and it may be your new favorite pan pizza. If you like lots of dough, this will be your place.",16,6,positive
1170,"After a few recommendations from locals, we decided to visit and taste for ourselves. We arrived and waited for about 10 minutes before we even got asked about what we would like for drinks. In discussions with the server, she advised that the deep dish takes about 40min to bake. So, we opted to get slices instead as we had a plane to catch. Well, 40 minutes later 2 of us got slices that were warm, not hot, warm. Our friend ended up getting a personal thin crust which is not what he ordered. The pizza was not good for any of us. We were absolutely disappointed with the service and quality of food. Maybe on a return trip, we'll try again and get better service and food.",7,1,negative
1171,What is there to state accept this is the best pizza in the city. They take pizza to another level for taste and the restaurant experience is not bad either. They did a remodel some years ago at the Clybourn location to add more seating and to update the look. The crust and the pizza sauce is just magnificent. This place is definitely worth the trip if you are not close to this location. They also have a location in Morton Grove. bon appétit!,3,1,positive

1185,"I had made up my mind after trying 3 other famous Chicago pizza places that I just didn't like deep dish pizza. Nothing was really that tasty. That's when a friendly local told me to give it one more try at Pequod's. I love to eat so I accepted the challenge.We took the train out to the nearest stop, but the nearest stop was about a 30 minute walk to the restaurant. It was sort of a good thing because we worked up a big appetite by the time we arrived. The restaurant has a cool neighborhood-y dive vibe, which I liked. It felt more like a college bar than a pizzeria. Seating is very limited and about 20 minutes after we were seated, a huge line of people formed at the hostess stand (they began quoting wait times of 1 to 2 hours)! It takes a while to bake a fresh pizza so don't come here if you are in a hurry. I probably should've taken away 2 stars for their awful instant iced tea. Skip it. So gross. I always lose major respect for restaurants that care too little to fresh brew their own iced tea. It's not that difficult to do! At least the beer list has Lagunitas, a must-have with pizza. I made the mistake of letting my husband order the pizza and opted for a medium with extra pepperoni. Let me tell you, Pequod's understands the concept of ""extra."" This pie was loaded with spicy pepperoni and it was good, but I had to pick off pepperoni to give him because there was so much. I really liked this pizza (didn't love it, but it's good). The crust is very light and fluffy and tastes like beer. It reminded me of a classic pan pizza crust, but the carmelization was amazing! I could eat that part all day long. The sauce was very spicy which I also liked. This isn't a fancy place but the pizza is great. It was worth the walk.",23,3,positive

Now its 5:45pm and we still have not been seated, I went to ask how long did we still have to wait for a table, the hostess gave me attitude as if ""how dare I asked such question"" and said we still had 7 people ahead of us.  Couldn't wait for that, had 7pm tickets for the movies and its almost 6pm, I still had another hour for a table and 30 minutes for the pizza... lol. I just placed an order for a carry out to have ready when we left the movie theater.. 20 minutes later, once I finished my drink, went to the same girl and asked to change the time for pick up, wanted to assure my pizza wasn't just sitting there over cooking if it was done earlier than expected. She told me it was impossible to change the time, she said "" the kitchen is extremely backed up, most likely it won't be ready by 9 regardless"". We get there at 9:30, which was the time I asked them to change the pick up time to, didn't check the pizza, was too excited to eat it since I had been craving it for months. when I get home, its an over cooked and cold pizza that I found.

1191,"Pequod's is my favorite pizza in Chicago and that is saying a lot because Chicago has terrific pizza.  To give you an example of how great it is, I never order an all veggie pizza because I usually don't feel satisfied unless there is a meat topping.  This is the only place where I will order one because their thin crust pizza is puffy and delicious, they have they perfect amount of cheese and their seasoning is so good.  Of course their thick crust pizza is wonderful too.  You can't miss with anything you order.",8,0,positive

1195,"Oh, deep dish. Tried 'em all, including now the locally-recommended Pequod's. Cheesier than others, bottom crust a bit thicker, and it sticks together better than most -- but it's also pricier than most, and with it comes a wait time longer than most.

Quick tip:  Instead of sharing a medium pizza between two people, get two personalized pizzas for more caramelized crust.",4,0,positive

1210,"First off: I think deep dish pizza is sort of like a very large hot pocket at best and a tomato soup in a soggy bread bowl at worst. SO, I'm a little biased because I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish. That being said, I thought that the amount of food was fantastic. The portion size is fairly good, though it's not exactly ""cheap eats"" for 2. My boyfriend was disappointed in what he got for the cost, but he also couldn't stop comparing it to regular pizza in NY. Pequod's felt different to me than Giordano's, and I appreciated the decor and the zombie Moby Dick theme, so for that alone, I think this place is solid. I'm a huge fan of sauce, so I actually loved that there was a lot of it, and that's my favorite part about deep dish. The pan style pizza here is served in the pan, and the service was good. The crust is nice and burnt, just the way we all like it. It's not a ton of cheese but still plenty for you to feel like you're going to have a heart attack. I think it would've been awesome for a late night snack but unfortunately, we had too many meals planned to take any home or go back. I look forward to trying this place again next time around.",15,7,negative
1211,"I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 but only because I put salt on the thin crust with anchovies and olives, which seems nearly impossible. Otherwise I'd give the pizza a solid 2.5 and contest reviews suggesting items even in the top 5 of Chicago pizza. I'm not sure how they got on this list but I cry foul...not even in the top 20.

1213,I went here once. It was a long wait and we had to wait in this little coffee like shop a store down. They must be partnered together.

They let you order pizza while you're waiting, which definitely helps. Beer options could be a bit better, but other than that this place is legit.",2,1,positive
1216,"Unless you go by yourself like I usually do so you can sit at the bar or unless you go at an odd hour, expect to wait at least an hour.That being said, the wait is totally worth it if you're looking for Chicago Style deep dish pizza. Pequod's does it better than anyone else and it isn't even close. I used to be a huge Lou's fan and still go there as I don't live near Pequod's, but when I have the time & am itching for the best deep dish around, I make the hour train ride to eat the best.What makes Pequod's the best is their perfected crust. Slightly burnt which gives it a crunch without being overly doughy. Their sauce has some zest and is not pure tomato. The zesty sauce gives the pizza some kick. Sauces that are pure tomato are garbage in my opinion. All their ingredients are extremely high quality. Great beer selection as well.If you're itching for deep dish that is head & shoulders above Lou's, look no further than this gem only true Chicagoans know about. Simply the best.",10,1,positive

1221,"Very mediocre. We were definitely disappointed based on all the stellar reviews of the deep dish pizzas. Our pizza crust tasted okay but nothing great. The dough was a little dry and bland. The wait here is also insane and definitely not worth it. I probably won't go back as it is not worth the wait for the mediocre deep dish. Personally,  I think Lou Malnati's is better. Maybe it was an off night? I came here once before but just got a salad. It was good, really big portion but again, nothing i would order again.",6,3,negative
1222,"I used to love this place in college. I went back tonight and had an awful experience. The hostess with the brown hair, glasses, and winged eyeliner was rude and a smart ass. If I call and make a reservation and you call it a reservation on the phone w/o any further information about said reservation, I'm going to assume I'll be seated within half an hour. An hour later we were seated. Reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't eat until 9:30. The pizza was soggy. I could tell it was soggy coming out but the guy who gave me a slice insisted it wasn't.

Which from my understanding is a very short wait time for a Saturday night. Once we got our table, we were seating upstairs. It almost felt like a ""Speakeasy Pizza"" joint. This place isn't a ""tourist pizzeria"". It's authentic Chicagoan, packed with Chicagoans. It's very loud[in a good way], people just entertaining their guests, having a good time, chatting, laughing, and enjoying some great pizza.",7,0,positive

I would like the default to be no tip and for me to add tip if I enjoyed the service.,4,1,negative
1226,"Pequod's. Pequod's. Let me count the ways I love you. 1. That caramelized crust: It makes my taste buds water just remember that deliciousness.2. That sauce: not too overpowering but spread evenly across.3. The pepperoni and sausage: delicious flavors that compliment the cheese and the sauce perfectly. 4. The mozzarella sticks: the best I've ever had. The cheese and the breading and  the marinara - they've perfected the formula.5. The Pequod's Salad: a delicious salad with meat and cheese and pepperoncini.I've heard about Pequod's ever since I moved to Chicago in 2010. But I never went ... until last week. And now I've been twice in the less than a week. Because the pizza is amazing. The service is great. Everything is amazing. I've ordered the pan pizza twice with friends and it's amazing. The caramelized cheese with a sturdy, yet flaky crust makes an amazing vehicle for the cheese and sauce and toppings. Every bite is a little taste of heaven. I love pizza of all types but this is incredible. It's officially made it's way into the number 2 spot in my list of favorite pizzas, which had been occupied by Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza for over a decade. But now it goes 1) Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder's pizza pot pies, 2) Pequod's pan pizza, and 3) Lou Malnati's deep dish.",17,1,positive

1228,"You clearly need to make a big decision regarding deep dish pizza, so I'll make this brief and hopefully useful: Pequods makes a solid deep dish. They're ""famous"" for their carmelized crust, which is really just burnt cheese around the edges. You will wait a very long time to eat it (45 mins from the time you order, that's not counting waiting for your table). You will be tempted to order a salad, because waiting 45 mins to put food in your mouth seems unbearable. The salad will be the saddest excuse for a salad you've seen, a complete waste of stomach space, but you'll be somewhat happy to not be starving anymore. Your pizza will finally arrive almost an hour later, and you will inevitably think it's the best pizza known to man, mainly because your stomach is half-full of sad romaine. But this! This is hot & cheesy and bready. Your rational brain may kick in and remind you: this is merely cheese & sauce on a thick piece of dough -- don't get so excited. Ok, ok, the edges are crispy, and that part is incredible, you wish you could eat a whole pizza made of the edges. You will then wonder: did I just order this monstrous pizza just to eat its edges? Perhaps. Perhaps you did. But that's what people do in Chicago, so there must be something to it. If that didn't help you make your decision, I'll just add: this pizza may not change your life, but it will fill your belly, and sometimes that's good enough. You'll also experience an authentic, bustling, pizza parlor vibe that doesn't feel touristy (except for all the people who are clearly tourists). The beer selection is pretty basic. The servers are all in a hurry, but remain nice enough. And those salads - please don't. There are lots of places in Chicago and beyond that make a tasty deep dish. Little Star Pizza in CA is still my favorite of them all, and they aren't in Chicago. The end.",19,6,negative

But I still give this place 3 stars because the atmosphere was fun, drinks were great, and I had a great time with my friends. The blackness on the pizza is from the fact they put cheese under the crust as well as on top of it, and so the cheese directly touching the pan tends to get really cooked. Personally, I just couldn't get it out of my head that I was potentially eating carcinogens by eating burned crust... but this is certainly not the restaurant's fault!

But THAT said, it's claim to fame are charred cheesy edges. These are nice, and different, and give a deep flavour to the edges of each slice. Based on a recommendation posted to Serious Eats, we got a basic pie with extra sauce, extra cheese. The sauce at Pequod's is great: zesty but not overpowering. But...yeah. I just didn't enjoy it. It was too ""bread""-y, and one-note (gosh, I sound insufferable). Not helping was the caesar salad we got in a bid to offset the pizza; it was just leaves with a gloomy dressing and hard croutons.

1249,"After seeing the restaurant on the travel channel and we were going to be in the Windy City, we needed to stop in and try. It was a Sunday evening and my wife called to see what the wait would be in an hour. They told her no wait. When we arrived, the place was packed and the wait time was 30-60 minutes for 2. This isn't necessarily their fault. You can't predict rushes of customers. Maybe a better way to say it would be there shouldn't be a wait but we can't guarantee anything. This was only the beginning of our wait. It was suggested that we can also sit at the bar, which is full service. We went upstairs and found 2 seats at the bar. The 2 bartenders were very nice and attentive. They had about 8 beers on tap, all light and hoppy so we stuck with water. We ordered a small Caesar salad to share and 2 individual pan pizzas. About 20 minutes later, the salad arrived. After waiting that long for a salad, it should have arrived in a bowl that had just been woven by master craftsmen. It didn't. It was a small salad, enough for 2 to share if your not very hungry. The dressing was very good. Nice taste of Parmesan. We waited just under an hour for our 2 personal pizzas. There is no excuse for that kind of wait without letting the customers know so they can chose whether they want to stay or not. We weren't given that option and we had walked for an hour to get here. The redeeming things were the staff and the pizza. I ordered a personal pan with sausage, pepperoni and garlic. It was delicious. Probably the best pan pizza I have had. We at at Lou Malnati's last time and, in my opinion, this was far superior a pizza. The caramelized crust was awesome. The sausage, our bartender told us, was made just for the restaurant and had a fantastic flavor and consistency. The sauce was a little sweeter than I usually like but with the crust and toppings, it was perfect. If not for the wait, I would go back again. Maybe try at another time. Pizza gets a 5 star rating. Wait time for pizza gets 1 star. Averages out to 3 stars.",15,3,negative

Waited over two hours for delivery (was quoted 1:30 when ordered, again when I called to get an eta after 1:30, and can be seen clearly on my receipt). The manager(?) was incredibly rude and called me a liar about the quoted time (""I doubt you were told 1:30 - we train our girls to say 1:30-2 hours). Looks like some retraining is required starting with you sir. Life is too short to deal with people like this. Point is...Many pizza joints that are much better and treat their customers with respect.

My friend called the next day to amend the order, still confirming the order to be delivered for Friday at 7:30pm. My friend called again on Friday afternoon to confirm the order to be delivered for the previously agreed time, and it was once again confirmed.Friday comes around and we made a little appetizer to be enjoyed while waiting for the pizzas.7:30pm comes around and no pizza.7:45pm, no pizza.8:00pm, still no pizza.We call Pequod's to see how much longer until we were to expect our pizzas. The person on the phone said the ordered was placed, but the kitchen staff didn't want to make the order, so they tossed it out. He said they were going to make it now though. He apologised and gave us a $30 credit to be used on our next order. The pizzas finally came at 9:30pm, 2 hours after the thrice confirmed time and didn't look very good and was super doughy, so I didn't quite like it. I guess the kitchen staff really didn't want to make this order.I'm extremely disappointed with this encounter with Pequod's. What is management doing to the kitchen staff to make them choose to ignore an order simply because they did not want go make it? Or was it just an excuse for them forgetting to put in our order all together? Please fix how you operate your business!",6,3,negative
1253,"I consider this the best deep-dish in Chicago, but ironically the menu says that they serve ""pan pizza."" From what I can tell, the main difference is that the crust is slightly less thick/tall, but Pequod's makes up for it with an unprecedented crispy and flavorful crust, which is rewarding given that so many deep-dish crusts are just soggy barriers for the delicious fillings.

We live 10 minutes away but with my bronchitis and the rain storm figured delivery was the way to go.Got the pizza at 8:30 (double the estimate). Noticed on the receipt the order wasn't put in until 6pm. Received it medium warm and the onion rings were cold - and they forgot the ranch .... straight to garbage and they are my favorite onion rings in Chicago.

1272,"THE BEST OF THE BEST! Do not waste your time going to Lou Malnati's or Giordano's. Pequod's is where it's at! I'm from South Jersey and am all about crispy, thin crust pizza. However, I actually debated my deep devoutness and commitment to thin crust pizza after taking just one bite of my personal deep dish mushroom pizza from Pequod's.I would be satisfied eating the crust alone, that's how delicious it really is. The crust is made from basically cheese that crisps and caramelizes while cooking. The inside of the pizza is not as dense as I would have expected from a deep dish pizza. It was creamy, light, and I didn't feel gross after chowing.I could write so much more about how unreal their pizza is, but I would prefer that my mouth stop watering.",5,3,positive
1273,"Unsure what the hype was about this place. The decor was old smelled kinda raunchy inside? They seated us upstairs in this booth, was about to fall apart. The fan above the table looked like it had not been dusted in years, swallow as the blinds on the window we were sitting by. The waitress was rude and obnoxious, one of them trying to be funny and cute - but she was neither. We ordered drinks (watered down alcohol) got some apps they were good but the smaller had like 3 of each thing, huge plate but minimal food. Then we ordered pizza - the most foul pizza I've ever eaten. The sauce tasted watered down - zero flavor and the pizza dough was not good - I asked if the pizza is always this burnt, she replied no they must've left it in to long - sorry were busy??? Really ? Then the bill came and was way over priced ! Over all if you want something in the upside - the food runner was the most pleasant person in the place and was the only one who was apologetic !Save your time go someplace else who will appreciate you spending about $200.00.",7,7,negative
1274,"Amazing deep dish. Get the pepperoni, caramelized crust is to die for. The long wait is worth it and the service is generally fast. Put in your deep dish order right away because it does take about 40 minutes. Awesome place to gather with buddies.",3,1,positive
1275,"Pequods does not have gluten free pizza which I need since I'm a celiac, but my husband wanted to try their pizza so I went with him. He got a deep dish pizza, wine and a salad. There was a 45 minute wait, so I went to grab a gluten free pizza down the street. His pizza arrived at the bar, so I sat down and was eating my pizza as well. The manager came over and told me I couldn't eat my pizza. He also said he needed to ask us to leave. I totally understand there is rules about outside food, so I put the pizza box in my oversized purse, and stopped eating. I thought since the pizza wasn't out that it would be ok. We continued to sit at the bar while my husband (a paying customer) was enjoying his food. The bartender who was very nice came over and asked if my husband needed his food boxed implying we need to go. My husband said he was not finished, and asked if we had to leave. The manager came back over, and aggressively told us he had said we need to leave. I offered to the manager to wait outside with my purse (which had the pizza box in it) while my husband finished. The manager was not having it. I could understand if we were not complying or making a scene, but the manager was totally out of line. My husband barely drank his wine, and had not yet touched his salad. He said he wasn't going to pay for the food if he can't even eat it. The manager said we still had to pay, but couldn't finish. My husband said he wouldn't pay if he can't eat, so the manager took his glass, forks, etc. and threw it all on top of the pizza and told us to leave. This was a terrible example of customer service! I will never go back. This guy seriously had a personal problem, and very unhappy in his own life. I can't believe someone would treat customers like that! Not only did he lose our sale, but we would have came back because my husband actually liked the pizza.",8,2,negative
1276,Best pizza in Chicago by far! Im not a fan of crust on any of my food but when I'm eating this pizza its my favorite part. I dined at the one in Morton Grove for my boyfriends 21st birthday & tonight this one. I personally like the Chicago location better but both have just as great pizza & service.,4,0,positive
1277,"Pick up is the way to go, as the pizza is still piping hot and fresh when you get home. I could eat that carmelized crust all by itself. Hands down, Pequod's has the best crust and pizza. Their proportions are perfect, as I find other places' dough/crust to be too heavy. Their sausage is amazing...really a stand out sausage. I usually get a sausage and pepperoni combo and another with green pepper and onion. While I can eat a lot, pizza is usually filling, but for Pequod's, I make sure I eat at least 4 pan slices since I love it so much. Diminishing utility with the more I consume doesn't really exist here at Pequod's.On another trip, tried the Italian beef and giardiniera. This was on point and they did it right, though sausage remains my preference.To note, I actually prefer NY thin slices but Pequod's pan pizza is that phenomenal.",9,0,positive
1278,"Decent, but not crazy good for my taste. With so many options of deep dish pizza, I think this one was way too salty and lacked the depth of the tomato taste that I like due to the excessive salty cheese.",2,2,negative
1279,"Pequod's has the deep dish pizza that I was looking for! We had a late lunch after walking to Pequod's from the Lincoln Park Zoo. It was 30+ minutes for our pizza to arrive, and the wait was worth it! We had the pan pizza with spinach, mushroom, and 1/2 order of sausage (for the husband). You pay for each topping, so we didn't go overboard. Bottom crust was thicker than at Lou's Malnati's which was what I was looking for. The caramelized crust was good and there was a generous amount of toppings. You get full quickly after one piece, but we had to finish it all as we were flying back home that evening. I noticed that the pizza was a bit saltier which was probably due to the cheese. The restaurant was larger than I expected with two levels and there was a private section in the back of the second level. Guess this is a good place for birthdays since we saw several large parties eating here.",4,1,positive
1280,"This is some of the best deep dish pizza I've ever had in Chicago. It's busy for a reason. Make reservations, it's worth it. Lots of choice.

Good appetizers and plenty of choice with the beer selection.Child friendly, they even had creations and drawings for the kids, remember it more like your local bar than a restaurant. Very nice staff.Enjoy",7,0,positive
1281,"There was so much hype about Pequod's Pizzeria that my husband, a friend, and I finally checked it out. It was extraordinarily busy, but we were seated quite quickly. The service was also prompt despite the norm of having to wait 45 minutes for a stuffed pizza at any establishment. Our server kept appetizers and drinks coming while we waited. The pizza was good. Was it as good as my favorite Chicago stuffed pizza? No, it wasn't quite that good in my opinion. Nevertheless, Pequod's offers a very solid Chicago style pie that everyone should check out at least once.",7,1,positive

1283,"I had one opportunity to try deep dish pizza. there were several places I could have chose from, but I picked here. I had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, and then another 40 minutes for my pizza. Waiting for your food here is like a quest. Its not easy, and there are times you want to quit. But patience is rewarded with their damn good pizzas. I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage. It was just enough for two hungry people, and we were definitely full afterwards. Service is not good, but its not bad either. Our waitress attended to us within a reasonable time, considering it was a full house. The crust gets alot of attention here, but I think the best part is the combination of everything. The main player in this pizza is the bread. Usually a hunk of bread that thick would be dry and disappointing. Here, the pizza is fluffy and moist. The toppings burst with flavor. I still dont know whether I like the pepperoni or the sausage more. The cheese was just enough to be gooey but not overwhelming. They could have added a little more sauce, but I think I preferred it on the less saucy side. the caramel crust was cooked just right, but its not mind blowing as some people make it. Overall, it was an excellent meal. Not too salty, not too greasy, and not too saucy (which gives me heartburn). considering this pizza was neither of these things is quite an accomplishment.",13,4,positive
1284,"So I have to admit, the waiting for a table and the. The pizza definitely tainted my opinion of this place. I came to Chicago for a conference and had a bit of a reunion with old coworkers, one of which lives in Chicago. She picked this place for us to all have dinner on Sunday of memorial day weekend. The place was packed and there were a lot of us. You can't make a reservation and we ended up waiting close to 2 hours to be seated. We ordered salads and the appetizer sampler to tide us over for when we finally sat down and the had to wait another hour for our pizzas. (For those keeping track, we had to wait 3 hours to eat.) The crust is as amazing as you've heard. Crunchy, caramelized, crispy. The sauce has a bit of a kick to it, which I didn't love. There could have been a little more cheese. Overall, it was good pizza but I was underwhelmed. That could have been from waiting 3 hours to eat, or it could be that I just like pizza the way they make it at home in NYC. Either way,  you have got to try deep dish when in Chicago. I would recommend this place but don't come with a large group. You will wait forever.",5,1,negative
1285,"Really good pizza. I've had the classics like Lou Malnati's and Giordano's and Uno's but this is great in a different way. The wait (almost an hour) was not fun which is why I took off one star but the service was excellent and the pizza is superb. The sauce is a little sweet which might not be to everyone's tastes but I was really enjoying it. The crust was unique too. It looks kind of burnt but it's actually just carmalized and it has a splendid taste. I'd definitely recommend this place. Good job, Pequod's!",10,0,positive
1286,"I am not a deep dish pizza person - I grew up on thin crust in our very Italian household - but I must stay this is very good pizza.  Not only that, the ambiance it very fun.  It's always a great place for us to visit during our Christmas Week-end on the city!",3,0,positive
1287,"This was the first time I had proper pan pizza -- and I loved it! Usually I'm a thin crust type of girl and of course once in a while I  crave my Lou and my Gino's, but pan pizza was never that appealing to me. BF's craving led us to this place, and I immediately loved the ambiance. We were seated upstairs and our order was taken fairly quickly. We started with the combo appetizer and I immediate fell in love with the mozzarella sticks and mushroom poppers. They were hot, crispy and tasted fresh. For the pizza, it took them about 30-40mins to get it to us. We had sausage and pepperoni with 1/2 mushroom and 1/2 peppers. They did not skimp on the toppings. I really liked the bread to cheese to topping proportion for the most part, and with just a drop of cholula, I loved my bites. We had 2 leftover pieces from a medium pizza, and when eating it the next day, I could taste the bread way more than anything else and that's when the proportion seemed off.Other than that, I definitely enjoyed my time there.",12,1,positive
1288,If you want cheese on cardboard then this is the place to come to. I think many of the good reviews come from the fact that it is open late and we all know that after alcohol just about anything is good. The crust was super dry and was covered with a thin layer of cheese. The waitress seemed quite disinterested in customer service. I would recommend any of the other local chains over this place.,4,1,negative
1289,"This is the pizzeria you go to in Chicago if you don't want to feel like a tourist. Lou Malnati's and Giordano's may be more famous, but I couldn't care less. Pequod's serves the best pizza in Chicago! Their secret is layering the edge of the pan with cheese so that it's baked into the crust, giving it an amazingly delicious flavor that's highly addicting. The pizzas are made to order and you can pick and choose whatever toppings you want. Because of this, it could take 20-40 minutes to get your pizza, but that's totally fine because you can kill time with pitchers of beer or whatever sporting event is on at the time.",6,1,positive

The special includes cheese pizza with a soda.  If this was available back in Los Angeles, you would find me here everyday.I added sausage, pepperoni and mushroom. It does take awhile for it to be cooked roughly 30-45 minutes. Totally worth it. The pizza is a bit bready but I totaled love it. Especially the burnt crisp. Ugh i'm salviating as I write this and wish I could eat it right now.Definitely a personal size is perfect for a person and I eat quite a LOT. I was totally stuffed after eating this.This spot is the spot. I tried the other competitors and this one ended up being my favorite. I came here twice before leaving Chicago.

1297,This place is great.   Best pizza in Chicago.  Now the wait is unbelievable   I called the day prior and asked if I could make reservations.   Well they don't do reservations but you can call ahead.  So I called ahead at 4pm for a table at 7pm and a when we got there they said there would be a 90 min wait.   So please order ahead and the best thing to do is take out.   It's very good.   I have tried a variety of pizzas in Chicago and this one is the best.,5,1,positive

1299,"I'm so torn about Pequod's. I know a lot of people love it, even close friends of mine, but I find it really basic. I've tried it on a few occasions--twice for takeout, and recently I stopped in to eat at the restaurant. It's definitely bready and more of a pan pizza than a deep dish, at least to me. I find that with takeout just getting it with plain cheese wasn't enjoyable. It just congeals and also loses its crispy texture underneath. I think the toppings are what offset the breadiness of the crust. That being said, the caramelized crust is really delicious, even as leftovers. My husband and I stopped in a few weeks ago on a Saturday night around 4pm. It was already pretty busy but it was only a 20 minute wait for a table, and they told us pizzas were taking 50 minutes. We got a table upstairs that was in the corner, which was nice. Our waitress was nice but I have to say the service was extremely disappointing. It took forever just to get a drink and our appetizer came out and was the wrong thing. A few tables around us also received wrong orders. We shared the house salad with ranch, and the dressing was really tasty. The wings, once we got the correct ones, were pretty crispy and had a nice BBQ sauce.Our pizza ended up taking almost an hour and a half to get to us and by this point we were starving even after apps. It was very cheesy and had good flavor. I like their sauce, it's not too sweet or too tangy. We did half with sausage and onion and half with cheese. I definitely prefer the side with toppings-- it offsets how thick the crust is. Eventually our area started to get really crowded and there was a big group of drunk people that snuck past the host and were trying to order pizza without waiting. The waitstaff just kind of let it happen, which was frustrating because it caused us to have to wait a really long time to get our check and leave.Overall I think the pizza is good, and I don't mind eating it, but I don't find it special. I also think that other Chicago ""deep dish"" varieties like Lou's are much better and have a much more enjoyable ambiance at their locations. Dining in at Pequod's was crowded, slow, hot, and just not worth it.",19,9,negative
1300,"If I could give zero stars I would. Awful delivery experience. After waiting 2 hours for the pizza, it was wrong. When I called I was told they would send out another pizza but that I'd have to wait another 2 hours despite this being a restaurant mistake! I asked to speak to the manager and was rudely placed on hold for 10+ minutes. The manager lied to me saying she would get out the corrected pizza to me in an hour .... it has been another 2 hours and still NO pizza!!! To say they're lack in customer service, lack in management, and overall rudeness leaves a lot to be desired!!! I would expect at the very least for the restaurant to offer me a gift card for my inconvenience! I would highly recommend getting your pizza elsewhere!",1,2,negative

1303,"My favorite deep dish place in Chicago!!! I love that they are open until 2:00 AM, which means I can satisfy my late night cravings. You can do RESERVATIONS (priority seating) online! Convenient, and if for whatever reason the time or day is already reserved, the manager will e-mail you telling you a different time or day he can do. We had a group of 14 on a Saturday and they were jam packed! We were seated on the second floor because of our bigger group. They gave us 5 high raise circle tables because they didn't have the shorter rectangle ones. That was the only weird part because some people had to deal with ""indents"" where they were sitting. Like you can just imagine connecting 5 small circle tables in a row and how some people would get stuck in the part where two tables meet. BUT I DIDN'T CARE, because the most important part was seeing my friends. I'm just letting you know in case you plan on bringing a big group on a busy day. [They do allow you to split 14 credit cards, it's a hassle but we didn't have cash]I also can't comment on the service, but because they were busy, you can't expect the constant service. They seemed to have plenty of workers, but still couldn't keep up with the crowd demands, The waiters were flying all over the place and I struggled to find my waiter maybe 2-3 times and kept going to other waiters. But none of them were rude about helping me even though we weren't their table. A funny thing I noticed is that they waiters have a habit of dropping plates (used) or glasses on the ground! I think there were 3 major spills during the 3 hours we were there.",5,7,positive

I also like the way they bake theirs a little bit more than most places, therefore the crust is crunchy.

The lunch special comes with a fountain drink for $4.95. I added the toppings so my total was under $7.50. It was delicious and cheap!A few things to note:*It takes awhile to get your pizza (at least 30 minutes but could be 45 minutes if they are busy), so if you are in a hurry, probably not your best bet.*They have great craft beer choices to go with your pizza.*It can get really busy so lunch or a weeknight be a good option.*You MUST go here :)Make sure to check out this amazing pizza place if you live or are in Chicago!",8,2,positive

We called in a delivery order at 5:30pm and did not get our pizza until 9:15pm. I couldn't believe it. When I called to check on the status at 8pm, the kitchen had not even gotten the order. The woman on the phone intimated that there was nothing she could do, and snidely asked if I wanted to talk to the manager. I spoke with him and he assured me he'd put the order in and have it sent out first thing. That took another 1:15 hours (I live 0.8mi from the restaurant). It's really unfortunate because it's good pizza, but just buyer-beware on deliveries... you may wait a long time. Pizza isn't worth a ~4 hour wait.",3,1,negative
1315,"I had the pan pepperoni.The pizza breaks down like this: 90% cardboard flavored crust, 4% mediocre sauce, 5% ashes of what was formerly cheese 1% razor thin pepperoni.This how a pizza would be made if the only consideration was maximizing the profit, as the cheapest ingredients dominate way beyond what is palatable; then handed off to an incompetent cook staff to burn any flavor right out of the pie.Will not be returning.",4,3,negative

I feel like a few years ago (like 2012-14ish) the crust was less bread-y, and had more flavor. The last couple times I've gone, I've been disappointed in both the food and the service.

Crust was perfect, some deep dish places or pizza in general get a flaky crust and I can't stand it. Their pizza sauce had an interesting twist to it, not sure if it had wine/brandy/sherry in it. But man what a delicious twist.Great job and we didn't wait too long either",8,3,positive

1323,"They're making pizza the right way here. I'm not a huge fan of the traditional Chicago deep dish style- but Peaquod's really nails it.The pizza pub atmosphere is great for a few draft beers and a couple slices. They make the pizza in such a way that the crust and end of the pizza is carmelized giving a crunchy bite of cheese. It's simply good, and unique from the other deep dish spots in the area.Can't miss this one!",3,0,positive
1324,"The staff was wonderful and amicable, but the pizza was not as tasty and delectable as expected for a highly reviewed Chicago Deep Dish Pizza eatery.  I must say, I was highly disappointed as this restaurant has received high accolades for the taste of the pizza, and I didn't experience that wonderful taste as mentioned in the reviews.  The dough had no flavor, and it was just toppings on a pizza nothing fantastic.  Papa Johns and MOD pizza were better tasting.  The staff again was wonderful they just need to improve on the pizza.",9,1,negative
1325,"This was our final deep dish pizza experience before we left Chicago, and it did not disappoint, the crust was nice and crispy and the pizza had a nice velvety texture, plus the sauce was quite tasty. We didn't have to wait for a table which was nice",3,1,positive

1327,Diner in once before and thought it wasn't up to snuff relative to the other deep dish offerings in the area.  Got delivery tonight and it was nonsense.  It was like a focaccia bread with absolutely minimal toppings.  Multiple slices had (barely) 1 of the 2 toppings we ordered.  This was an embarrassment.  Complete joke.  Never again.  Only plus was fast delivery.  Try Chicago's Pizza or Art of Pizza nearby.,2,1,negative
1328,"Great pizza- questionable service.  Spent over 80 dollars and they switched servers on us mid meal- no word on it, just new server- who checked on us pre food and to package up leftovers- which they then threw away.  Disappointing because the food really was very tasty- and would have made a good lunch.  Oh well- next time we will be a little less easygoing and will have better service to go along with our delicious food.",4,0,negative

You're welcome in advance.",2,0,positive
1333,"An embarrassing example of Chicago deep dish pizza. Check out the picture I posted that shows large hunk of bread with a tiny layer of cheese on top. A lot of the pictures look great with that burnt crust and all. But what you are not seeing is that there is almost no cheese on this ""pizza"". I was sorely disappointed after checking out the pics, seeing their high rating, I was expecting much more. Hopefully you read this in time so you can save your hard earned money for a more substantial pizza.  What they serve here is disgraceful.",2,5,negative
1334,"Not impress at all... Came in on a Wednesday night before the rush and the pizza was just basically bready. Major lack of sauce and cheese!! Our pizza wasn't even cut symmetrically, let alone it was even barely cut we have to use the pizza scooper to get a finer cut before putting it on to the plate. Been yearning to try this place out but left pretty disappointed. We got a sausage and pepperoni pizza and those two ingredients were point on. But the sauce and cheese was a different story. All of the tomato sauce fell onto the crust of the pizza and I like pizza crust and all but our pizza crust was burnt! So I wasn't even able to enjoy it as much. The thickness of the bread was major carb overload. Not enough cheese and sauce to balance it out at all. If anything, I say get thin crust so you won't be as disappointed as I am. But I never had thin crust so I'm not sure if it's any better.",7,3,negative

She said ""that's how Pequod's is. I asked for a manager and she hung up the phone on me. Horrible customer service!

1339,"Major disappointment. It was the crust/base.  At this place deep dish means a whole lot of bread with a small amount of toppings.  We went to Giordano's and Lou Malnati's the two nights prior and based on the reviews thought we were saving the best for last.  Nope!  It was ok but certainly not in the same league as the others.  Way too much dough and average quality toppings. Waitress was ok, decor was like a dive bar (which I like when the food is outstanding), wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back.",5,1,negative
1340,"Pretty damn good deep dish! The tomato bisque soup was also yummy. The appetizer sampler wasn't that great, but we ordered it since we knew the wait would be long. If not for the app, 5 stars!",2,1,positive
1341,"With chains like Giordano's and Lou Malnati's serving up deep dish in Chicago, Pequods is certainly a hidden gem. However, it is my FAVORITE deep dish pizza in Chicago and I never fail to mention it to those looking to try deep dish for the first time. I took my family here and they also agreed it was the best pizza they've ever had.There's more of a sports bar vibe from Pequods than from the other chain restaurants, it's often dark, open late, and there can be tons of people depending of if there's a game or not. What sets Pequods apart is their crust on the deep dish. It's perfectly cooked so that it's carmelized and crispy which makes the pizza that much better. You can't get crust like that elsewhere. Keep in mind that deep dish pizza can take a while to cook so either be prepared to wait (it's worth it) or order some appetizers in the mean time. On weekdays, you can call in and order ahead of time so that the pizza will come out faster once you've arrived. They also don't take reservations so on weekends and nights when there's a sporting event get there early or be prepared to put down your name and wait.",8,2,positive
1342,"I start to say pizza at its best! Although service need some work. I ordered my food 45 minutes in advance. Got there and hostess was not pleasing me at all.

1344,"Their bartender(?)/manager behind the bar warmly greeted us as we walked in. Deep dish pizza isn't my thing, so not going to rate based on that. On the other hand, my friend had a thin slice pizza and she said she's had better, ""it was ok"". I LOVED my tomato bisque/soup paired with bread and butter. I ordered plain wings as well with ranch on side-- chicken is chicken. My only qualm is the hipsters loitering by the bar. I'm not sure if they were workers on the clock (pretty slow evening; 12a) or they're just hanging out. Regardless, they took away from our server's potential attentiveness. They were loud, obnoxious, and kept talking to our waitress, while we were trying to get her attention for the check. If they were off the clock employees, I don't care how slow the place is, they need to take it down a notch and stop impeding on the server's job. It's like, you want to tip a server, but why would you tip someone who's just bringing you your food, and not checking up on you on a timely manner or to see if we're waiting on you to take the check because your back is towards us blabbering with your friends/coworkers. Shit, if im tipping you for satisfying bare minimum, leave the food at the bar and I'll pick it up myself. Regardless, because I know how entitled most millennials/this generation is, I'm forced to tip, for social courtesy.",7,2,negative

The only downside was over an hour for delivery, but luckily I wasn't hungry when I ordered.",1,1,positive

Then if you order extra sauce / ranch dressing to make the pizza more palatable, they charge you extra. $2 for a ramekin of bottled ranch dressing? Come on.

1353,"Good pizza, but don't ever order this place for catering or delivery. 3 times I've called 48 hours before, and they ALWAYS lose the order.They have no system in place to keep them straight. The answer I always get is ""the register prints it up the day you call, but it was put in the wrong place in the kitchen"". You may say, ""Why not just call the same day?"" To that I say, ""Because they don't open until 10 and if I need a lunch catering order, they wouldn't have enough time to fulfill it."" When I called today to check where our 11:45 order was (it was 11:50 when I called). After the person answering the phone couldn't find the order, then I was put on hold and a manager came to the phone, I was told ""they were running late"", when I asked how late, they said it would be here at 12:45! This is NOT A TYPO! They were going to be an entire hour late!! I asked if they WERE ""running late"" how come no one could find my order when I called?? I told them to NOT LIE about it and just admit that they lost/misplaced the order AGAIN!! They FINALLY arrived at 1:15! An hour and 1/2 hour later than I needed it for a meeting! I'd have stopped using them all together after the 2nd screw up, but occasionally someone from our office wants it instead of Malnati's. But after this time, I am done (at least they credited me for the entire order. Doesn't make it less embarrassing in front of a client when lunch is 90 minutes LATE!

1354,"Lovveee their deep dish (pan pizza)! I would seriously rank this place as my second or first choice for deep dish in Chicago! I have a group of friends whom which we go to a different pizza joint every week. We have tried Giordanos, Ginos, Lous, Piece, Dantes, Boiler Room and this place is a great place for deep dish! Service at the restaurant was great! Our waitress was very friendly and took good care of us... she joked around with us the entire time we were there. Another thing I really appreciated about this place was that we told a staff member who brought the pizza to the table that we were excited to try this pizza and wanted to compare to other we have tried. He instead of bashing or bad mouthing other pizza joints given he works there instead talked about other pizza joints he visits or which other pizza he would recommend we tried! I thought that was pretty awesome!I will def be back in the near future to have more of that yumminess!!!",10,2,positive
1355,"I've been hearing about Peqoud's for a while now and finally decided to give it a shot. I ordered a sausage and pepperoni pan pizza and a side of mozzarella sticks for delivery. I called at 11am, as soon as they opened, and was told it would take 1 hour 15 minutes. It ended up being 2 hours before the pizza arrived, which was extremely frustrating as the estimated time they gave me was totally off.Already hangry by the time it finally arrived, I was praying it was worth the wait. The mozzarella sticks weren't cooked very well and were pretty bland. The pizza itself was very good and unlike some other pizza places, they didn't skimp on the toppings. There were plenty of huge pieces of sausage and pepperoni and I was sufficiently full after 2 pieces.Overall the pizza was delicious, but not delicious enough to justify the wait. Maybe I'll try dining in sometime in the future, but I'm not in a rush anytime soon.",8,2,negative

I'm not generally a deep dish fan but the caramelized crust can't be beat. Also, their deep dish tends to be on the saucy side which is key for me.The place itself is authentic, narrow and too damn crowded. I prefer the second floor where there's slightly more elbow room. We always call in advance to make a reservation, thereby cutting the wait time in half.",5,2,positive

Erin and Alan took good care of us...my mouth was watering when that first slice got cut and placed gently on my dinner plate. Goodness, I've gotta get back to this joint ASAP. God Bless Pequod's!

I'm pretty easy going so the wait didnt bother me....tequila makes everything better anyway. I think i did myself a disservice by ordering the deep dish in a ""personal"" size.  We ordered two personal sized deep dish pizzas so that we could try two different types. I think you definitely gotta go for a bigger pizza to get the full effect. We also ordered the sampler appetizer and i really enjoyed that.

My suggestion would be to call 30-45 minutes before you intend on coming to see what they wait time is like. Their pizza isn't bad, I'm just a die hard Lou's fan. The crust on Peaquod's pizza is fluffier and softer than Lou's buttercrust. Have it and you be the judge Lous or Peaquods?! Service was nothing special.",2,4,negative
1371,"Went here expecting SO much more than I actually got. Pizza was really not that good. I would honestly say that Giordano's, Gino's East, even Lou Malnati's are all a million times better than the crust/sauce/cheese here. The staff was very inattentive and careless. It took her about 13-14 minutes to bring our drinks, after we waited about 30 to be seated and 10 to be greeted by a server. We ordered our pizza which took about 40 minutes to make (super reasonable for a deep dish). After trying to get her attention for about 15 minutes after being completely done with eating our food (which took about 25 minutes because we were STARVING), we told her (our server) that we were in a rush so head out and if she could bring our check. She was rushed and said okay and brought us our checks. We put in our card and she took the payment and we did not see her for the next 40 minutes, after requesting her to please hurry up because we were running late at this point.

It is in a pretty low key spot on Clybourn just past Webster, slightly busy street, parking is not very easy on the street.If you come past 6pm any night, expect a long wait, we happened to get here right before the evening rush and did not have to wait, and if you're coming in on a weekend, there is usually a very long line outside, but it's worth the wait!We sat upstairs, it's a very cool/ fun vibe all over. There are a few TV's around, but nothing too overwhelming and everyone that works here is really nice. We started with a house salad, big enough to share, and then we went to the pizza... We ordered the Medium pan pizza, we each only ate one slice it was so delicious and filling. You choose your own toppings, they don't have any set pizzas on the menu, and the pizza was divine. The crust is sweet, buttery and savory in one heavenly bite, along with the sauce and toppings, it's just amazing. I will for sure be back! :)",15,0,positive

Last time, the sauce was lacking flavor and the salad was not fresh (it was replaced). In recent past, pizza not hot all the way through.

I reallly enjoyed it (Extra L for emphasis). The Deep Dish was more of a Pan Pizza which had a thick crust. For my first time having true Chicago Deep Dish pizza it was pretty good. Next time Im in Chicago Id like to have the Deep Dish slice that has the toppings in the center and bottom as opposed to the top. Back to Pequods though. The pizza was crunchy and the cheese was perfectly burned along the edges. I thought that it was great. The service was pretty good. The pizza did take a while to arrive, but Im starting to learn that pizza making is a bit of a slow art form.So overall this was great pizza. The toppings were tasty and the pepperoni was really good. Can't wait to get back to the Windy City to have some more. 5 Stars",13,2,positive

1393,"Okay, so this is my favorite pizza of all time. Sadly, I haven't gotten it as many times as I would like.The personal pizza I recently ordered really lacked flavor compared to the full size deep dish I normally get to share.The biggest issue I've had here is when I waited an hour for a large pizza for pick up, went to pick it up to find out they made the wrong size. The size they made would not have been enough food for my group, so they offered the pizza they made at a discount, or wait another 40 minutes for the pizza I ordered. I had no choice but to wait and still had to pay full price for the pizza. No discount, no apology, nothing. Really frustrating.Such a shame as I've always been such an advocate for this place and have stayed away lately.  Might have to venture out to the Morton grove location to get my fix!",3,2,negative
1394,"I've been wanting to come here for a while now. Their's alot of hype about Chicago deep dish pizza. Everyone one I asked recommended this spot, so I had to give it a try.  I knew they would be a long wait but so did everywhere else. I started out with garlic bread to eaze the hunger a bit. When it arrived I was disappointed in the quality of the bread. Tasted like it came from the grocery store so I didn't finish. Then I ordered a salad and it was pretty basic as well, nothing special. They told me to wait for the pizza was 1 hour long, which was fine considering how many people were there. So I actually went next door and got some sushi and brought it back to the pizza place. They were totally cool with it. 20 mins later my DEEP DISH PIZZA showed up and it was HUGE! (I ordered a small btw) having waited this long I was pretty excited to dig in..........................Dam that pizza was worth the wait, and will totally go back. So 5 stars for there pizza but the rest of the food is decent. Which is expected since they specialize in deep dish. Non the less I had a good time and the hostess was nice. Thank you",12,2,positive
1395,"This was the second place we tried on our quest to taste ""famous"" Chicago pizza. So far we're not understanding how these places have earned their reputations.We ordered our pizza to be delivered and it came in an hour. That was perfectly fine with us (it was a Saturday night and was actually delivered on the lower end of the time frame I was given). Pizza arrived hot and fresh.Just to clarify, Pequad's does not make a deep dish pizza. I see a lot of reviews calling their pizza deep dish and it's not, it's a pan pizza, which means it's a very thick crust. We knew this before we ordered and we are fans of pan pizzas, so this wasn't a surprise for us. We ordered a personal sized pepperoni, and a large pineapple.Overall, the pizza was edible. Sauce was mild in flavor (but at least it had some flavor compared to the other place we tried), there wasn't a ton of cheese (this could be good, or bad depending on your preference), and the crust had no flavor and was way too dry. I don't think I've ever had pizza crust fall apart due to being too dry. That was the biggest downfall of this pizza...dry crust that isn't very flavorful equals a lackluster pizza. The cheese caramelization on the edge of the crust was right on the cusp of being overdone. If it had been cooked any longer that cheese would have been burnt to an inedible state. Thank goodness it wasn't cooked to that point, but it was really close. Maybe if it was cooked a couple minutes less the crust wouldn't have been so dry and the caramelized cheese along the edges would have been in a more enjoyable state I don't eat dairy or eggs and I decided to in order to find out what makes Chicago's pizza great. So far that decision hasn't been worthwhile. You're letting me down Chicago!",11,3,negative
1396,I like Peqouds deep dish. Yum. So filling. So satisfying. Reasonable. Decent beer and drink list/menu.Not fancy nor pretentious. Causal.,3,0,positive
1397,"Went on a busy Friday night, and when we checked in, there was an hour wait but two seats happened to open up at the bar within about 10 minutes, so we snagged those (bar is first come, first served). We ordered jalapeño poppers and a small sausage and onion deep dish pizza. The bartender got our drinks out quickly and the poppers were out within 10 minutes. They are the cheesy kind, not the cream cheese kind like I am used to, but they were still delicious and not too greasy. The pizza took longer (about 40 minutes) but we were expecting that as there is a big sign on the hostess stand setting that expectation. It was WORTH THE WAIT. The pizza was delicious and the crust was amazing.",4,3,positive
1398,"Deep dish pizza at its finest. Truly, it doesn't get any better than this. Beautiful, carmelized crust that is to die for. It's heavy and you'll be full afterwards, but your tummy will be happy.I'm fairly picky when it comes to deep dish, this place hits the mark.",3,1,positive
1399,"My girlfriend and I had a bad experience here a few months ago, and I posted about it on Yelp. Within minutes, the manager emailed me to apologize for what happened and told us to come back whenever we wanted and that he would buy us dinner. We did that tonight - and everything was excellent (and free). My girlfriend and I split the Pequod's salad and kept it simple with the pizza (large deep dish wish pepperoni and sausage). We have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow, and the staff and managers couldn't have been nicer to us.I've been to this location probably a half dozen times and will continue to go in the future. Thanks, Pequod's, for your excellent customer service! (And pizza!)",4,2,positive
1400,I don't understand the fascination with this place. Sure the deep dish is different and good but with so many pizza places in the city and being a thin crust fan I don't think I'll eat their pizza again.,2,0,negative
1401,"Heaven in the form of pizza. Forget the places you've heard about before and go here if you want good, Chicago pizza.

1402,"Favorite deep dish/authentic ""Chicago-style"" pizza. If you're from out of town and debating on which to try go to Pequod's! There will probably be a wait, but grab a drink and just relax - you're about to have the best pizza ever. The burnt cheese crust is simply to die for.",1,1,positive
1403,"Pequod's Pizzeria, tomato sauce masters! I'm speaking specifically to all my heartburn people out there, this sauce will not keep you up at 3am in the morning, but enough about all that. I came to Pequod's with my girlfriend, Gaby, wanting to try out this heavily hyped pie. The joint was juking, which was to be expected on a Friday night, but it only took us 40 minutes to get seated which was not bad due to the reputation of the joint and the incredible crowd waiting outside (pro tip: you can get ahead of the wait line if you call in for a table the day before). To pass the time we went three doors over to the Drinkingbird and had a couple of Schiltz and PBR's for 3 dollars a pop while we waited. Once our buzzer thing vibrated we rushed over. Walking to our table all I was getting was college/frat vibes (esp. on the second floor) from the decor to the people. I went to UOI, so I'm a natural in this habitat (just wanted to fully disclose for all the anti-bros out there). Once seated we ordered immediately since we already knew what we came for and did not want to drag out the hold time of the pizza. We ordered buffalo wings and a medium pizza (sausage & pepperoni - 1/2 jalapenos). The wings came out immediately and they were really good, the only problem for me was the price of the wings in comparison to the size of the wings. I literally, in one bite, can clean those wings. I drank one beer and a 1/4 of my second beer before the pizza came out which is okay (I like my pizza out before I finish my first beer (I sip lightly everyone, at restaurants only of course lol)). Once the pie arrived, we dug in. The ingredients are to die for, plain and simple. It was GREAT! I can really see what all the hype is about and the fun atmosphere complemented the entire experience. Trust me - if you haven't tried this place, don't let the hold time faze you, you will be rewarded in the end.  *****I will say this though, I AM NOT A FAN OF THE ""CARAMELIZED"" CRUST at the end. Idk if this is an accrued taste like wine or something BUT TO ME IT TASTE BURNT. The cheese and crust underneath the burnt ends tasted great nonetheless.The restaurant as a whole is 4/5 for me - the wings 3/5 (this rating is leaning on the weight of the price) but the stuffed pie was 4.5/5. I will def. recommend this pie to friends and family.Cheers everyone!",12,6,positive
1404,"This is the BEST place for deep dish pizza!My favorite part about the pizza here is how the edges of the crust are slightly burned so it's really crisp. I've tried 3 different deep dish pizza places in one day to compare them all (Pequod's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's) and Pequod's is the best in my opinion! I can't comment on the service here; I always order for pick-up because I'm too impatient to wait, unless I am catching up with some friends and passing time anyway. Keep in mind that you will always have to wait for deep dish pizza if you expect a quality, fresh pizza no matter where you go.",4,2,positive
1405,"Deep dish done right. We had our medium pie delivered. While the delivery time was a little longer than what we would've like, the wait was well worth it. In a town with a pizza place on every corner, Pequad's stands apart. Try it, you won't regret it.",4,1,positive
1406,"Let me start by saying I am NOT a deep dish fan. It is too much for me, but naturally you have to get one because you are in Chicago. Pequod's is what the locals recommended so we came here to see what it was all about. The pizza's crust isn't that dense thick crust that we all think when we think Deep Dish. This crust was thin and crunchy- very much like a cheese crisp. This is the best deep dish I have ever tasted- the cheese to sauce ratio was all on point. I wish I could say this place has made me a deep dish convert- but that would be a lie. But if you like deep dish then this place will most definitely be your go to spot.",5,1,positive

1411,"Delicious pizza, terrible wait. So the pizza is 4-stars, but the service is 2-stars. I put in a request online for priority seating about 4 days early and never got any sort of email confirmation so I called the day of to confirm. The girl who answered wasn't all that friendly and begrudgingly added me to the list. It was packed when we walked in and I was told about an hour wait. Well...we waited 2 hours. Now I understand the priority seating is not a reservation, but it's supposed to cut the wait time in half. You can't tell me a normal wait time was 4 hours! It's an understatement to say the host seemed overwhelmed, so I'm not sure the priority seating list was really happening. Once we were seated the service continued to be slow, and the waitress didn't seem to move all that quickly. At about 9:30 the pizza finally arrived and everything was right in the world again. I was so excited about the caramelized cheese on the crust and I'm happy to report it did not disappoint! YUM!Despite the delicious crust, I'll be sticking to my old buddy Lou Malnati in the future - shorter waits and they let you put in your pizza order before you get a table. I will only be revisiting Pequod's for take out.",5,3,negative
1412,"Was able to try this and Lou Malnati's while in Chicago and this place is #1 for deep dish in my book. The service was great and the atmosphere was fun. The crust is the specialty here, they pile layers and layers of cheese on the side of the pan, making a cheesy, burnt crust that made it so crunchy and flavorful. And the fact that we were able to choose the toppings was what got me super excited.After a night of drinking, nothing was more satisfying than this, and of course, we had to order more drinks.. We literally piled it high with mounds of toppings! We got mushrooms, jalapenos, fresh garlic, sausage, Italian beef, and hot giardiniera. The giardiniera and Italian beef is definitely a must-get. Can't wait to come back!",6,1,positive

1415,Delicious pizza! The deep dish personal size is very filing. It took about 40 minutes to get our pizza so plan to stay a while and get an appetizer if you're hungry already. We got the cheesy garlic bread and it came out quickly and was very tasty.,0,1,positive
1416,"Not worth the wait at all.  We arrived at 7:30, were seated at 8:45, and weren't served until 10:40. I was fully prepared to wait but quite frankly almost two hours for food is ridiculous. Manager obviously didn't care when we complained and I'm 99% confident that they gave our order to the table across from us and that's why it took so long to be served. And the pizza was lackluster even though I was ravenous by the time it arrived. Overhyped and underwhelming. Beddia in Philly has one man making pies and they are always slammed b/c of their Bon Apetit review and yet they manage to keep their shit together and consistently deliver. No excuse. Figure it out.",3,4,negative

1419,"Definitely a pizza  joint you want to try if you have a big appetite. I was full after 2 slices. The place does get busy. We had to wait 1 1/2 hours before being seating and another 45 minutes for the pizza to bake. We ordered the garlic bread for appetizers and a small pepperoni, sausage, and onion for my wife and I. It was enough to get us full and crust is decent. Wasn't a big fan. We brought our 8 month old son and the restaurant was accommodating. Overall, wasn't worth the wait.",3,0,negative
1420,"3 hour wait...3 hours! I thought to myself, there is no way any pizza is worth waiting this long for!We were a group of 7 and killed time at a nearby bar to snack on tacos. When it was our time we headed to the restaurant and took our seats upstairs in a booth under a large tv. The waitress took our orders and we were eating cheesy, bready appetizers within 15 minutes. I tried not to gorge so I could save my real appetite for this infamous pizza. I managed to eat half a appetizer and finally 45 minutes later our pepperoni and sausage pizza arrived. It was freakin amazing. I cherished every bite and wished my stomach was bigger to hold more of this saintly pizza. Others at the table ordered double sausage which was comical because when it arrived we could barely see the crust...there was soooo much sausage! Everyone who ate it said it was too much so don't bother getting a double order, they hook it up plenty without needing that. I left smiling and think this is the best pizza I've ever had in Chicago. It's also very reasonably priced compared to other places. 3 hours is steep though so I'd attempt to go at a down time or order to go.",7,5,positive
1421,"I've tried this restaurant once due to a friend's glowing recommendation, and was severely disappointed. We ordered delivery, so in fairness I haven't tried in person, but to say the order was botched would be an understatement. My fiancé and I ordered two pizzas and a salad. She is a vegetarian, so naturally we ordered a vegetarian friendly pizza.  Her pizza came overly dry, with very little sauce, and cold veggies. My pizza came with burnt crust, and very poorly distributed sauce and ingredients. The salad never came. The driver didn't alert me to it, and when I asked where it was he blamed the kitchen and said he only takes what they give him and doesn't have time to confirm the order. He offered me the cash equivalent to the salad since I paid with a card, and that he couldn't run the salad back to me since he was too busy. Is this what you call customer service? I called and asked for the manager. She replied with ""what would you like us to do, we're busy"".  What I would like is for you to take a basic level class in customer service and give a customer what they pay for.  She was useless and unapologetic. Do not recommend. Won't be trying them again.",7,3,negative
1422,"5 stars for dining in, 3.5 stars for takeout or delivery. Their pizza is about the best you can get when you eat it fresh at the restaurant - although waiting for a table can sometimes be a pain during prime times. But it is worth it if you have the time. The pizza loses something when you take it to go or have it delivered but it's still very good. There's not much bad to say about Pequod's.",4,1,positive
1423,"Pequods is a good as pizza gets. Plus this location is open late, late, late...perfect to hit after the bars in Lincoln Park. The deep dish is excellent. Great Chicago-style done right.

I've had the chain pizza places in Chicago and although Peq's isn't as deep, that's the beauty of it! You don't get too much bread, or cheese, or with little pepperoni... Peq's is just the perfect balance between bread, cheese, reeeeally love sauce, & pepperoni. & this is why I love this pizza! Plus, you don't get full off 1 slice, I had 3 bc I love to eat and didn't want to eat more because I didn't want to be that hog. Could've easily had 4 comfortably.I'm from Cali and Cali has no good pizza.

1434,"Chicago, I love you for many reasons, but your deep dish is high on the list.  Since moving away, every time I've been back, I've gone to Pequod's.  If you're going for dinner, be prepared for a long wait.  Most really great places in Chicago have long waits, so this is to be expected.  Since there isn't a lot of space to actually wait, you can always grab a drink at the bar that is two doors down, and they'll give you a call to let you know your table is ready.I always start off my pizza meals with a salad to get some healthy veggies in.  But when at Pequod's I douse my salad in their ranch dressing because it has a little extra something in it that makes it awesome.  I think it may be extra garlicky or something, and it is great!  Their house salad also comes with cheese on top that shaped like a fish, which is always endearing.  All deep dish places have something they do a little differently.  Here at Pequod's they're known for their caramelized crust, which really sets them apart from the rest of the crowd.  You can't go wrong with any pizza you would choose.  It is some seriously tasty pizza!My last visit in was over the holiday season during lunch time, and there was a bit of wait.  They have a nice little lunch combo for $4.95 that comes with a 7-inch cheese personal pizza and a fountain drink.  Regular toppings are $.80 extra, and you can also add a small lunch salad for a couple extra bucks.  We went this route, and I enjoyed the pizza, but I am firm believer that the personal pizzas at deep dish places are never as good as the full sized pizzas.  Please tell me I'm not alone in thinking this.  I swear it's the cooking time or something.If you haven't tried Pequod's yet, you're missing out!",11,1,positive
1435,"I've been to Pequad's a few times, so let me start by saying that the pizza is great. With that said, however, we had such an awful experience with their customer service that they deserve no more than 3 stars. I've been eating deep dish pizza my whole life, so I understand that it takes a long time to make; however, at Pequad's apparently it's supposed to take an hour and a half. That's what a manager tried to convince us of when, on a not so busy afternoon, the table next to us was seated, ordered, ate, and left all in the time that we waited for our pizza to come out. It was pretty frustrating at the time, but in retrospect kind of funny. I'll most likely go back, because that crust... sooo good, BUT it's going to take a while for me to get over this.",3,3,negative

1444,"I came alone and was seated promptly at a high two-top table. I'm glad they have a lot of small booths and tables. the iced tea tasted really sweet and definitely not freshly brewed. On the contrary, they do have a rotating Three Floyd's beer on tap, so props for that. To start, I ordered a half Pequod's salad. I enjoyed it as it had a lot of different ingredients like pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese, and onions. The Italian dressing came in a plastic container, like I was taking it to go. The dressing was good, but not thrilling.At 5:30 on a Friday night, it was already 50 minutes for a personal pizza. I ordered a pizza with sausage and mushrooms and added spinach to half. When it arrived it wasn't cut, so there was no picking this pizza up! The caramelized crust was very good, maybe not as good as Burt's crust was. The sausage was phenomenal, great seasoning, nice sized pieces. The spinach was whole leaves, not a chopped up mix like at Gino's East or Lou Malnati's. I coulde taste it, but was glad it didn't overwhelm the rest of the pizza. Also, the pizza tasted really saucy. I like a lot of sauce, but it was to the point where I could barely taste the cheese.The service was...interesting. I had one server through the time that I placed my order. Then, I never saw her again. Another server took care of me the rest of the way. I had to ask if she was my server now and she said yes. I just expected to get some kind of explanation as to why there was a switch. Also, there isn't much space to walk, especially downstairs. I feel for the servers as they have to navigate through some really tight spaces.It was a good experience and I'd enjoy having the pizza again.",18,0,positive

1446,"Pequod's, you truly live up to all the hype everyone is talking about. Pequot's has the best deep dish pizza you will ever taste. Forget Lou Malnati's, Gino's, and Giordano's. They don't even come close to Pequod's.Come early or call-in before you arrive to get on the list. My husband and I came on a Saturday night and were predicted a 2-hour wait. No worries though, we walked to the Drinkbird, just 2 stores down from Pequod's, for a drink while waiting. And shortly after finishing our first drink, we were notified that our table was ready. We waited for ~ 45 minutes before our table was ready. Just in case you were wondering, Barnes and Nobles is out of range for the sensor to work. Trust me, we asked them too. What makes Pequod's so unique is their crust. That caramelized crust is so delicious that there are no words that can properly describe how amazing it tastes. You just have to come and try it yourself. I promise you you won't regret it, and it's worth the wait. You have to pay extra for each topping, but don't worry, they are very generous with their toppings. NOTE: It takes ~45 minutes for your pizza to cook after you order, so you should order an appetizer.

1447,So I ordered a full order of pasta with a side salad specifically asked for marinara sauce on top of the pasta with the melted cheese I hope I get the post a picture because they are as dry as can be no Parmesan cheese at all maybe I'm supposed to request that but actually it should automatically come with it so that will go in the garbage because I work 12-hour shifts and there's no way I'm going to wait 12 hours to eat and hopefully the salad will fill me up I will never order from them again!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!,2,1,negative
1448,"My FAVORITE pan pizza anywhere!  I order the same damn thing every time: pepperoni/mushrooms/green olives.  It brings me joy.  Like making guacamole, or listening to an old V-8 accelerate on LSD. I especially like how the crust has burnt cheese on it. The pepperoni often has a bit if color too. I will always be a fan!",2,1,positive
1449,"Best deep dish in Chicago. Like most locals, this is a topic we take seriously!! I will fight you on this. Their burnt cheese crust does it for me. As an original Wisconsinite, cheese is important to me. My friends and I agree that Canadian bacon and pineapple here is the best but go crazy and get whatever you want. Add pepperocini! Outside of the food being amazing - it's a fun atmosphere / sports bar. It's also unique and not a huge chain. If you have a weekday free go before 3PM for their awesome $5 personal pizza deal!",6,1,positive
1450,"I have heard about Pequod's Pizza from several friends as the best pizza in town. This is a very popular place and loved by many. I could tell from how crowded it was when I went to pick up my order. Although my pick up time was 7 PM, I was standing there in the restaurant along with many others for 45 minutes until my order was ready. The hostess made it sound that it was normal and she was unapologetic for the wait time. Putting that aside, I was extremely disappointed with this pizza. Its definitely not for everybody. I did not care for the crust or the ingredients. The sauce was pretty good but everything else tasted bland.",6,3,negative

1453,"We had a going away party on a Saturday. Thankfully, they allow you to put in a table request the day before via their site, which was great for our party of 10. (This is not a reservation. Just gives you priority seating.) You still have to come in a little earlier to wait, they will give you a pager which works near the bar at the Drinking Bird. We ordered 3 large pizzas for 10 people and still had a few slices leftover. Pizza wise, it was okay...I wasn't drawn to it. there wasn't any flavor that stood out. it was just very thick pan pizza (not a layered pizza). I still like Lou Malnati's style pizza more and may prefer Giordano's over this.  Service was fine and they also allowed us to split the check with many credit cards.",6,1,negative
1454,"My take on my recent Wednesday evening experience here is mixedThe Good:The option to be able to call ahead and put your name on the list for a table is helpful A few decent appetizer options to select from (fried zucchini was good)Reasonably priced menu itemsThe restaurant is easy to find, and the surrounding neighborhood has plenty of free street parking Their infamous pan pizza was a 8/10 for me as far as tasteThe bad: Hosts spent too much time talking with each other instead of welcoming customers into the restaurant (not efficient)Waitress was almost non existent. She rarely came by, and when we needed her, she was hard to flag downThe personal cutting knife they brought me had paper and pieces of food on it (gross). So overall I would say the food is good, but the service and cleanliness is questionable.",8,5,negative
1455,"The atmosphere: We got here before the rush on a Friday evening (around 6pm) so I can't complain about the wait, but shortly after it got very busy. All the take out order individuals cram into the small space which is uncomfortable for the seated patrons. The pizza: Dry (almost burnt) crust. Like everyone else says, the ratio of bread to everything else on the pizza is too much. The cheese is very stringy and you feel like you have to chew each bite for ten minutes so you don't choke on it. For all the toppings I ordered there was zero flavor, where's the seasoning? I've definitely had better and I wouldn't suggest this to a friend.",2,3,negative
1456,OOooh Pequods carmel crust.. i am gaining weight here.  A bit loud inside but the food is always good and we take the remains home for leftover that last all week.  In fact the pizza has an after life in the microwave oven.  Good stuff so take it home !,2,0,positive

1458,"My Chicago tour included three different pizzerias in hopes of discovering the best: Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Pequod's. My favorite by far? Pequod's!Each takes a little while to get from ordering to eating, making calling in ahead when possible a wise decision. But flavor? Ohhhh man. Technically a pan pizza I'm told, Pequod's is just dumped with everything the way I want it.It looks a tad like a dive bar walking in, which probably has to do with the time of its founding. By the way, I kind of also like that there's only one location - it gives it more of an authentic, non-chained feel. Even if the service was, well, a little bit distant. Can't win in everything, and in this situation I didn't particularly care, probably due to the dive bar feel.The best part? The pizza, obvi! The lunch special is somewhere around the $5-6 dollar mark (sorry, I forget), including a soft drink, which I didn't very much care for but gratefully accepted, a lemonade. The bread is thick and delicious, a slightly caramelized crust, and flavorful cheese and toppings hold the rest of it together. I threw on their sausages and mushrooms for an incredible delight.When I move to Chicago, I know this will be my to-go spot for sure.",13,2,positive

A hair was found in one of our personal deep dish pizzas and the others weren't that great. Finally, splitting our bill was a big to do, we were charged more for the drinks when she split the check.

1465,"Overrated. I went on a Friday night with a group of 8. We called ahead for priority seating which worked out well. However, when we got to our table we noticed that there were a lot of open tables and there were lots of people waiting outside. It seemed like they were trying to make people wait unnecessarily or there was not enough employees. Our waitress had way too many tables and didn't pay much attention to us after we ordered our food. It took us 25 minutes to get the check because our waitress was swamped. We were given pitchers of water at the beginning of the night that were never refilled. This place is trendy and appeals to a younger crowd however they don't value an exceptional customer experience. I got a snooty vibe and felt that the employees think that customers should be honored to get a table. The pizza was good but I wouldn't recommend it to tourists who have never tried deep dish as the pizza was more of a pan style. Overall, don't believe the hype.",9,2,negative
1466,"I'm not sure why this pizza is so talked about in Chicago! I had to see what the fuss was about, so I ordered a personal pepperoni deep dish and a thin slice of cheese (yes, I like food). The thin slice was just like any cheap greasy slice, nothing really to it. I was excited about the deep dish however, since I've heard great things. I have to say... this is NOT real Chicago style deep dish. It is a VERY thick slice of bread with minimal sauce and minimal cheese. Chicago style pizza should be minimal crust, and a whole lot of cheese. I was extremely disappointed.",4,4,negative

We also got the cheesy bread: very basic Italian bread with mozzarella cheese and no special seasonings.

The crust is more bready than a traditional deep dish style, but the flavoring of the crust is very good. The olives added delicious flavor too. Their cheesy garlic bread was also pretty good! Not just dry bread without flavor. It was a nice lil app. I'd probably come back again and try some other pizzas!",6,1,positive

1498,"Two words: Underwhelming. Disappointing.But this review is solely for the ""thin-crust"" pizza.I feel like I'm the only Chicagoan (or visitor of any kind) who has something bad to say but I have to say it for anyone who, like me, actually don't like thick pizzas. Sorry, Chicago, but I love me some NY-style pizza. It's the real thing. :PI was with friends who wanted to try the place and thought I'd have a great experience like the many other patrons.However, I guess my first mistake was getting the thin-crust, which is not what they're known for. As I am not a fan of other pizzas, I thought this would be my best bet. For the three of us, the pizzas took 45 minutes.As soon as my pizza arrived, I was disappointed. It was not thin-crust at all. The outer edge where you hold it was really very cushiony, and the rest was just normal thickness. I knew I wouldn't find NY-style but Pequod's definition of thin-crust is way off.But that wasn't really what bothered me. The flavor was just not there. There was nothing about the crust that tasted good (my friends who got pan pizzas said their crust was amazing, so I was envious!). It was really just like plain white bread. The cheese literally sat on the pizza in one sad, rubbery clump, not integrated with any of the vegetables I had selected (they tasted fine but were completely unseasoned). I could only stomach two slices as I was hungry before I just felt like I was eating cheap white bread with plasticy/fake white cheese. Honestly, I've had way better pizzas at Giordanos if you want to talk hyped-up places. Even Blaze Pizza, a franchise, turned out better. Not to mention Dimo's in Wrigleyville which has fantastic pizza. And, crust aside, they win when it comes solely to flavor.My friends were happy with their pan pizzas, though. But if you only like NY-style pizza as I do, don't go even if your friends are raving about it. Let them experience it without you unless you're willing to go for the pan pizza (like I said, I can't speak to it, but I hear it's good and my friends who tried mine agreed it was pretty lame). It's totally not worth the wait and money.",25,7,negative

1503,"This place is famous for its pan pizza.  The caramelized layer of cheese for crust is what makes the pizza here special.  That being said, we had to check this place out!  Upon walking in, I noticed that this place looked more like a bar, rather than a restaurant.  We were seated in a small booth meant for two.  The atmosphere was loud, but that was expected given the bar environment.  The appetizers and the pasta all looked so good.  But we knew we would not be able to finish them all, and still have room to try the amazing pizza!  So, the GF and I just decided we would just order the small pepperoni and mushroom pan pizza. After waiting about fifteen minutes our pizza made its way to our table.  I was surprised with the short wait after because we had dined at Lou Malnati's the prior day.  Our server there  told us the pizza would take 45 minutes to cook.  I thought he was joking at first, but he was not kidding. The pizza was downright delicious.  It was hands down the best deep dish I have ever had in my life.  There was nothing negative that could be said about the pizza.  It was not overly saucy, and they did not cheap out on the toppings.  I loved that the bottom of the pizza was crispy, and not soggy.  I had to use a knife and cut the bottom because it was just that crisp.  The crust was the best part.  It was still so hot, despite eating the crust last.  The cheese was heavenly, for lack of a better word.   I love that this place opens until 2am.  The service was good, and the pizza was amazing.  I would recommend, and will definitely be back.",16,1,positive
1504,"If pizza preference measured my city pride I'd be a terrible Chicagoan. Thin crust has always been much more appetizing to me than a block of melted mozzarella. If I must dive into the deep dish though this is the spot I do it. Their caramelized crust really steps the experience up a notch. They don't get the national recognition of Malnati's or Giordano's, but I promise you Pequod's is where it's at if you like feeling like you're pregnant after eating pizza. Lots of topping options, decent sauce to cheese ratio, and again of course that caramelized crust. I don't often do pies this way, but when I do I choose Pequod's.",5,1,positive

As a Chicagoan, I don't understand how people can still be hung up on Lou's and Gio's with this place around, they pale in comparison. The thin crust here is good but the deep dish pan pizza is to die for! It has a caramelized crust and is cooked to perfection every time. This place never disappoints and by the way, they have a very generous delivery range.

1506,"I wish I could give this place a 3.5, but I'd rather give it a 4 than a 3. There are many pros and cons.Pros: This place was HUGE. I was surprised to see that they're able to seat so many people. There is an entire section upstairs. It actually two separate sections. The service was good after we got seated. The pizza was decent but did not blow my mind. They tell you how long it will take to cook appetizers and the pizza which is excellent and much appreciated. Good french fries. Great prices on pizza! The crust was nice and fluffy! Even when I ate it cold the next day after I had it in my purse for 5 hours (don't judge me), it tasted great.Cons: There are kind of a lot. They told us 30 minutes to get seated (long), BUT the time was accurate and they actually sat us in 30 minutes. We ordered drinks and they came out quickly, but the drinks were pricey. I paid $5.95 for a pint, and those were the prices for almost all of their beers. We ordered half an order of fries and bruschetta. The fries were really tasty but I wish I had a bottle of ketchup rather than packets. The bruschetta was not good. It was bland and the bread had this weird orange color to it. I ordered a pan sized personal pizza and the size was perfect for me and I had half the pizza leftover. I ordered pepperoni with basil. My pizza was burned AND I really hate it when the basil is cooked with the pizza. Fresh basil should not be cooked in my opinion. The delicious taste of it goes away. It didn't taste fresh by any means :(Overall, someone said we had to try it so we did. I'm not upset about it, I don't regret it, I may go back, but it didn't blow my mind.",11,9,positive

The sauce wasn't intensely flavored and they were pretty stingy on the sausage. Not only that the pizza pie dough itself wasn't very flavorful; didn't have that yeasty quality you'd expect. They advertise the caramelization on the side of the pizza, which they delivered on, but ultimately that flavor didn't penetrate into the rest of the dough, which left for a less than amazing experience.For better deep dish pizza...Art of Pizza.",6,4,negative
1515,"OMG.... Go late so you don't have to deal with as crazy of a wait. We stopped in around 11PM; and still had to wait. When the place was pretty empty. *scratches head* that didn't make sense... and the hostess had all sorts of weird excuses about why we had to wait.Anyway... we got the bbq chicken wings with ranch and an order of their to die for pizza.Absolutely. Amazeballs. Usually with deep dish pizza, the first slice has the perfect balance of crunchy outside crust, with fluffy insides, balanced with tomato sauce and toppings and gooey cheese. Second slice is usually soggy and not so fantastic. Pequods still kept its texture and crunch when I tackled the second slice! That is something that's never happened before.... This whole in the wall looking restaurant that's not located in downtown Chicago had the best deep dish pizza I've ever had.Definite must for any trip to Chicago!",5,4,positive

1518,"Incredible deep-dish. My friend was visiting and had never been to Chicago, so this was a great introduction into Chicago style pizza. We loved the sausage and the consistency, I would definitely order the pizza again--but only for take-out. We had been warned about the wait which was crazy, but the sheer noise from inside the bar when we went in to pick up the pizza was overwhelming. There is no way that you could eat or have a conversation comfortably--take out all the way!",3,2,positive
1519,"Any time we have family/friends visiting from out of town, this is where we get their deep dish fix! Expect to wait to get in (a few spots around you can hang out at) and it takes about 45 minutes to cook the pizza. This is not bad service, it's typical so just be prepared. Their appetizers are really good --- the cheesy bread is super delicious. The place is nothing fancy but is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Their crust is what makes it!",5,3,positive
1520,"Don't fall for the hype....A great surprise, my boyfriend and I walked in expecting to wait over an hr for a table but got seated immediately. We were so surprised I even asked the waitress if this was peqouds lolol. So, yay for that. Now onto the important stuff, the pizza. My boyfriend and I ordered a customized pan pizza and it was disappointing. It was a very average pan pizza, I have had better. Usually I will scarf down pizza but last night I only ate a slice because I was so disappointed I didn't want to bother anymore. So there you have it- not all that great. Their crust is way too much, the pizza is literally 80% crust 13% tomato and cheese and 7% toppings- I need less crust and more tomatoes, cheese and toppings please Won't be coming back",5,5,negative
1521,"Whoever said real Chicagoans don't eat deep dish is a liar. Pequod's is my go-to at least once a month. That caramelized crust is what dreams are made of. I recommend getting your pie with extra sauce, as I find the leftovers are better that way.",2,0,positive

1528,"I had the pleasure of trying this joint not too long ago, and it was pretty good. We ended up going around dinner time on a Saturday and yikes...the wait was three hours for a dinner table! However, to get your pizza-to-go it was only an hour and so we settled. Our pizza was topped with spinach, garlic, and Italian sausage (those three go great together). The crust was something different from what I'm used to, it wasn't bad but I don't know if I absolutely loved it. I'd definitely return on a less busy evening to review on service, but I definitely think you should give it a try!",5,1,positive

1532,"Stinky. Saw my waitress 3 times. Walked in and the wait for a pizza said 40 minutes. Only bright side was sitting down immediately, however we waited over hour for pizza after we ordered. When the pizzas got there, one pan pepperoni and one thin crust cheese, it was mediocre. The only highlight of the pan pizza was the amount of pepperoni, which you could taste.  The cheese was barely there and was baked into the crust, with the rest of it tasting like cardboard. The thin crust stunk, wanted to get it off my plate. No flavor at all. To top it all off, we missed the first couple minutes of the Bulls game to see the Red Wings and the Flyers. Very disappointing as a Chicago lifer. The hype isn't worth it, find some other place to dine.",4,2,negative

1534,"So on my road trip to Notre Dame I had to sample Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I have tried several and if I rate those a four I have to rate this place a 5!!!!  Secret to going to these top pizza places is to go on off times and early. This place luckily takes reservations but it is small inside and a tavern feel vs other places that are true restaurants. We sampled the thin crust (which in my mind is still thicker than most pizza) and the traditional Deep Dish. If I were to come back again and I will it is deep dish hands down. The crust and sauce are melting with flavors all around. This place is truly amazing. Again small place, tavern feel but of course kids are allowed.  Also if you are stopping by before a Cubs game and score parking Uber or Lyft to game.",2,1,positive
1535,"Hands down, unequivocally the best deep dish pizza period. There is no equal, I have eaten and eat a lot of pizza and nothing on this planet compares to a Pequod's pepperoni deep dish pizza. The caramelized cheese is amazing!!! Fun to eat inside, the place has character. You may wait a bit for your freshly made, delicious caramelized crust pizza, but it is worth every second. Great tasting bubbly fountain soda awaits to refresh your palate.",6,0,positive
1536,"His place has the best pizza in Chicago hands down. What makes this place different is the way they make pizza. The sauce is amazing and full of favor. They caramelize cheese on the crust which captures the flavors amazingly. I have ate pizza from several locations and I have yet to find something as good as this location. Some advice:1. If you are coming on Friday or Saturday night, you will have to wait up to an hour to get in. This may seem like a long time, but there is a reason people wait. You can call ahead and have priority seating, which can shorten your wait. 2. My personal opinion, the more ingredients you place on the pizza the soggier it will get. Less in this case is more. 3. If there are any major Chicago sporting events, it will be packed. 4. Parking is rough at times. Drive on the street behind, there are more chances of finding parking there.",6,1,positive
1537,"Oh my Quod, buckle up for what may be the most ridiculous food experience I'll ever have.7p - Called in a delivery order for a small deep dish and bruschetta. Told it'll take about 90 minutes.8:45p - Called back to inquire and sat on hold for five minutes. Never a good sign. They say the pizza will be out the door in ten minutes and we're promised some kind of discount on the check (card was already charged). Aka the order was lost and they just put it in. We didn't expect it to actually be out the door in ten minutes, but nonetheless proceeded with that thought.9:30p - Call #3. My apartment is about 3 miles/15 minute drive from Pequod's, so it should have been here about 9:10 if their previous timeline is to be believed. Turns out the driver had the wrong number and couldn't get ahold of us so they drove back. Gave them the number once again and waited, wondering if death was nigh.10p - If the driver was headed right back out with our order, they should have been here by now. We get the same answer as before, which we're quick to shoot down since 10 minutes ago was 20 minutes ago. The entire charge has been voided, thankfully.10:45p - Call #5 (!!!!!!!) At this point we kind of just want to go to bed, but know we need to eat. We're finally given the manager again. This is only the second time we've spoken to him, the first being a brief apology during call #2. He apologizes profusely but you can tell he's basically at a loss for words at this point (can't blame him). No idea what happened to our order but he's going to put another pizza in. He also takes down our information and we can get a free order in the future (don't think that'll get used).11:30p - The driver finally arrives. For those keeping score at home, it took 4.5 hours to get our order. Of course, this happened when I had less than zero food in the house so we had to commit to waiting this out.Here's the worst part after all of this - it wasn't good at all. The pizza was predictably terrible since it probably went through the oven at a billion degrees to get it out. It's probably decent in normal form, but not better than the other deep dish places. Disappointing given all the rave reviews I've heard.Never, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVER (shout out to Chris Jericho) order the bruschetta. It was actually kind of hilarious. Uncooked bread slices that had been oiled and a salsa cup of what was basically pico de gallo. Chopped tomato and onion with no seasoning. Sad panda.Clearly Pequod's has earned many fans over the years, but maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.",10,7,negative
1538,"I have been dying to try Pequods, and I finally did.  First of all, I prefer thin crust but everyone said I would love this deep dish.  Yes, it is probably the better of the deep dishes I have had but I was really disappointed in their sauce.  The sauce was super bland and lacked seasoning and spice which kind of ruined the whole pizza for me because it wasn't very flavorful.  I did really enjoy the caramelized crust; it was the best part",6,4,negative
1539,"This is my favorite pizza in Chicago, hands-down.  It is light and fresh, without the greasy crust most chains have.  I also love the atmosphere; it is very casual and friendly.  It does have long wait times, but it's worth the wait!",6,1,positive
1540,"Man, this place is kick ass. It has a real, local feel from the exposed brick walls to the staff and people inside. Nothing fancy or hip bit feels like a place where real deep dish pizza is made the same way they've been doing for decades (could be wrong). The service was really great. Not overly attentive or anything but a casual sense about it. Three guys total, after a night out, we split a medium deep dish with Canadian bacon, pepperoni, spinach and sausage. 6 slices total and 2 slices each and the waitress was absolutely correct-totally enough. Proved us wrong when we thought of doing two pizza pies. The pizza was absolutely savory and delicious. Thick and heavy with a crunchy harder exterior and a chewy soft doughy bread on the inside and amazing toppings. Not the kind you grab with your hand and bite in 3 goes. Definitely a knife and fork sitch. Also, great value for the yums - $30 for a medium with five toppings. Left very satisfied.",10,3,positive
1541,Terrible service and food. I ordered deep dish for delivery. I asked for Italian beef as a topping and when it was delivered it was sausage. I do not eat sausage so I called to ask for a new pizza. At first the lady said sorry there's nothing they can do about it as the receipt says sausage. I specifically said Italian beef. They sent a second pizza after 1.5 hours and it was soggy and gross. Frozen grocery store pizza would have tasted better than this! So disappointing...especially because I had guest in town and this totally ruined their Chicago pizza experience.,1,4,negative
1542,New favorite pizza place in the city! Although the wait times can be lengthy around lunch time the wait is completely worth it! The lunch special is a wonderful deal and pequods offers a nice selection of drinks and desserts. The only downsides I can think of the is the long wait time for the food (pan pizza takes a long time to make) and the low light. Will be back soon whenever I'm in Lincoln park!,4,1,positive
1543,"Absolute best pizza in Chicago!!  The caramelized crust proves that mistakes can yield amazing things - it's what sets their pizza apart from all the competition here!  And it's definitely worth the wait (to sit down b/c they're always busy, and for the pizza itself!).  :-D",4,0,positive
1544,"I hate deep dish. I don't care for it. I don't like all the cheese, the sauce, and the bread. BUT, Pequod's is THE ONLY place I will eat deep dish at. They do it the best!TIP: If you're going on a Saturday night, make sure you get there early, we got there around 5:30pm and we still waited about 20-30 minutes for a table. The environment is loud and busy, so if you wanted a ""romantic quiet sit down,"" this is not the place for you. Anyways, the pizza is made fresh and will take about 40+ minutes until you get it, but I must say IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. I shared a small with another person, and it was enough since I personally don't eat much. I had 1.5 slices and I was quite full. Their service is amazing as well, our waitress was super nice and attentive even though it was so busy inside. LOVE LOVE LOVE Pequod's. BEST deep dish in the city, hands down!",11,1,positive

1546,"Winter is coming, and what better way to prepare for hibernation with a delectable dairy dish! The deep dish pizzas are worth the wait at this hole in the wall sports bar in Oldtown Chicago.These heaping mounds of sauce, cheese, and your choice of toppings are definitely not what the Italians envisioned when they invented the first pizza. Order your choice of a small, medium, or large platter either to share or devour yourself. But beware, this decadent dish packs a punch. I've seen many a ill-fated customer loosen 1 or 2 belt buckles after trying to conquer these savory behemoths.What I recommend you to do is gather 2 of your most lactose tolerant friends, order yourselves a medium deep dish with sausage, green peppers, and of course, Pequods own freshly grown Chicago basil and prepare for a scrumptious dish.",4,3,positive

1551,"In a nutshell: Chicago deep dish in Wicker Park.Came here with family, as it was highly recommended and we were driving through the area. Pequod's is located caddy corner to a fairly new shopping center, with a movie theatre, Barnes and Nobles, etc.Parking 3/5Fairly easy. Found street parking a couple blocks down. There is lot parking across the street, but we didn't want to have to pay.Ambience 3/5The place essentially looks like a long sports bar (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…). Bar on the left as you walk in, and most or all of the tables are stool height. Restrooms are in the back across from the kitchen and are pretty clean for a sports bar.Service 4.5/5Actually really good. This earned them the fourth star for me. Our server was really nice, and checked in with us pretty regularly. There was a mix up with our order (I'll get to that later), but she fixed it by giving us half off our food bill. She didn't have too, but the fact that she did was pretty awesome of her.Wait time 1/5Seating - BWaited about 20 minutes for seats. Not badDrinks - AOrdered a pitcher of 312 of the menu (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…) and this came out quick.Food - FExpect to wait longer for deep dish, but this time there was a mix up with our order. The tables around us all got their food before us. We ended up not getting our food for almost an hour and a half. By the time it showed up we were hungry and grumpy. However, we were not as grumpy as we could have been, as the server told us beforehand that she would take half off the price of food for us.Food 4/5Jalapeno poppers - 3/5They didn't suck and they tied us over.....kind of.Large Pepperoni Sausage and Onion (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…) - ABomb. Very comparable to Lou Malnati's. I'm a huge fan of deep dish, since I don't eat it very often. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni in general (shame on me), but everyone else wanted it.Small Sausage Mushroom and Basil (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ…) - A-Very tasty but the crust was a bit burnt. Not enough to make it a crappy meal, but then again we had been waiting for over an hour for this. Overall 4/5Food was good, and the service staff did an amazing job trying to make us happy despite of the mix up in the kitchen. Sometimes $h!t happens, but it's all about how they react to it that sets them above other restaurants. Happy with the experience, and I would definitely come back here.",15,5,positive
1552,One of my favorite places for pizza. Deep dish. Thin. You name it. It's freakin' delicious.Whenever someone is new to Chicago and asks what place is good for pizza. Say Pequod's.I love the buttery crust.. the edges are nicely caramelized and crispy..The wonderful cheese to sauce to topping to dough ratio is just right.Their selection of craft beer is great to go with your hearty pizza too.It's Hawks season so when you go here on a weeknight expect it to be busy.I love this place.

We were able to get our first round of drinks from the bar while we waited to be seated. I was very content with the speed of the service from the bartender.Once we were seated, the waitress greeted us promptly and helped us with the menu a bit. She was quick and efficient. Over all the service was immaculate for how busy the restaurant was. Well done. Now on to the food.We ordered bruschetta, wings, and a 12"" traditional style pizza with spinach, onion, green pepper and onion. The bruschetta was buttery and light. The wings had a killer buffalo sauce that I would like to purchase to my own use at home. The deep dish pizza was to die for. The crust was super crispy but the dough and cheese in the middle was warm and gooey. Perfect for a cold winter night. Something about their recipe just screams true Chicago deep dish. I would recommend this place to anyone who's got a craving or wants to show some out of towners how Chicago does pizza.",11,2,positive

1556,"This place is deservedly well known for its pizza, I've never had a better deep dish pizza crust. Which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. That said, there are MAANY issues in this establishment which will make me and many of the other customers who gave up and left that night never come back. First off, the management of the way this place is run is absolutely horrible. People were waiting 2 to 2 and a half hours and being told it would be an hour and a half. Then, people who called in got bumped ahead of everyone else who had ALREADY been waiting for a ridiculous amount of time. Everyone was upset, there was a small uprising, and it made for a very stressful environment. Managers, get your staff and yourselves organized because that was a mess.Second, the place is completely understaffed. There was one hostess for hordes of people trying to ask questions and get their names down. Waitress were given so many tables and people to attend to that they had just enough time to drop your plate and run to the next table, so we could barely get in questions about getting more drinks or more food. The staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed.The stressful and frustrating experience is not worth it. The pizza is good, but not good enough for that to be ok. Take better care of your customers, because in that one night I saw at least five groups, not including mine, decide they weren't returning, and for good reason.",10,8,negative
1557,"One of the best pizzas of my life.  It's like a Ferrari of pizzas.  You can tell that they put in a lot of work and amazing ingredients to perfect their recipe.But to cover the whole experience.  This place is awesome.  It has two bars.  One upstairs and one downstairs along with seating for eating in both.  It is like a dive bar, that happens to serve some of the best pizza in the world.  Let's just say if I lived within walking distance, I would be here far too often! :)Drinks were good too.  They have blue moon on tap and make cocktails.  Oh, and the sausage pizza is what we had and it is a must because I think they make their own sausage because it was mike mama's meat balls on there.If you live in Chicago or within 50 miles of this place and haven't tried it then you are missing out.  There is a reason why it was voted top 10 pizzas in America.",10,0,positive

Waited more than the 45 minute wait for 1 small pizza for pick up. Why on earth does it take that long? Actually, if I place my order now, it should be ready when I get there after a four hour flight Pizza is good, but be prepared to wait and wait and wait.

1560,"I never fathomed giving my favorite pizza joint in the entire city of Chicago three stars, but I am. The pizza continues to be stellar, but the service has gotten bad. Really bad.On my second to last visit, July 25 for lunch, our server was also the bartender. She was very unfriendly and acted like we were a bother. Then, to top it off, our lunchtime special pizzas arrived with the wrong toppings.Fast forward to a couple days ago, September 4 in the early evening, when our pizza again arrived with the wrong toppings. We had to ask twice for refills because the server forgot. And the pizza took 1.5+ hours, nearing two hours! We were told because it had ""a lot of toppings."" I've been going to Pequods for almost 10 years, ordered very similar pizzas, and never heard that excuse. Do you mean you forgot to put in the order, perhaps? Or maybe the kitchen messed it up? Who knows what happened, but when waiting a total of 2.5+ hours, it was disappointing to end up with the wrong pizza.I recommend the servers repeat back the toppings to customers. I know Pequods has a loyal following (that was once me) but you can't let service fall by the wayside.",6,9,negative

1570,"I came here a few months ago and was pleased with the deep dish pizza. It wasn't some amazing  out of this world pizza. It was comparably less amazing than a pizza at Lou Malnati's or Giordano's or Gino's East. I do realize that grouping different pizzerias may be a sin, but the pizza from Pequod's is nothing extravagant. Flash forward to a few days ago and the experience, and pizza was much different. Our group consisting of four people had chosen to order a thin crust pizza because the wait time was well over 40 minutes. We ordered a pizza with sausage and mushrooms on one side and various veggies on the other. The pizza took almost an hour to arrive, and our waitress was less then accommodating.When our pizza did arrive it was a glob of cheese that was soggy and really just disgusting to eat. Imagine the worst pizza you have ever eaten, and that was what we were served that day. It was sad to be served such a unflattering pizza by a restaurant that supposedly makes good pizza...I would've liked to have written a positive review on this restaurant, but I also wanted to show future customers the other side of the coin. Overall, if you get a good server, and have the time to afford a deep dish pizza, you're golden. If not, you are eating at an overrated and underwhelming ""pizzeria"".",10,5,negative
1571,"I'm a Chicago native so you can bet I have tried just about all of the Chicago Deep Dish pizza's out there. This is definitely my favorite of them all!I have been coming here since the bar next door used to Flounders (currently called the Drinking Bird I believe?). When it was Flounders, the owners would let us bring the tasty goodness of their neighbor (if their kitchen was already closed) after drinking shenanigins with close friends. Which of course always tasted like heaven.Whether or not I have had an adult beverage or not, this my favorite of all deep dish pizza's. The caramelized crust is just mouth watering. The care they put into the ingredients and the customer service is apparent every time you come here!Funny story, the first time I brought my best friend and her husband to Pequods, he was like why's the crust burnt?! I said no, not burnt it's caramelized. Now when he was in Afghanistan he would tell her how much he missed his ""burnt crust from Pequods!"" I may not go into the restaurant very often, but I'm sure glad they deliver.

1573,"My rating is based on the delivery ordering experience.  I called in to place an order and was greeted by a very rude and impatient employee on the other end of the line.  Someone having direct communication with customers should have better customer service than what I received.  The experience was so awful that it left a distasteful flavor in my mouth before even trying Pequod's for the first time, which I was super excited for.  To make matters even worse, they got the address wrong so the poor delivery driver had to turn around to get back to my  apartment.  The pizza crust bottom was soggy by the time we got to enjoy the pizza, over an hour later.  The za was decent but nothing extraordinary.  I'll try Pequods another time as a dine in customer and hopefully have a better experience, but in the mean time I'll keep exploring other pizza options.",7,6,negative
1574,"I hate to leave a glowing review, because I'd like tourists to continue thinking Giordano's and Lou Malnati's are the deep dish gold standard. However, it's the best deep dish in the city, making it the best deep dish the United States. The wait can be long, yes, but with plenty of seating and a beer or two to pass the time, it's worth the wait.",6,1,positive
1575,"Let the debate begin!  I had the deep dish with sausage because that's one of my favorites at Lou Malnati's which is at the top of my list.  I heard about Pequod's famous crust, and I have to say I did enjoy it.  There is definitely more crust to the pizza than other deep dish joints.  For example, Giordano's has got the thick layer of cheese making up most of their slice.  Malnati's has equal amount of cheese and sauce.  At Pequod's, it's crust.Don't get me wrong, there's sauce and cheese but not as much as the other places, so know that going into it.  Now the sauce was great.  Right up there with Malnati's.  At Giordano's the sauce has this kind of burnt/baked on feel to it which is still good.  The sauce here was very tomatoey like Malnati's and tasted fresh.  Now for the sausage.  It tasted great and I just wanted more.  Maybe it's because it was a personal sized pizza.Overall, really enjoyed it.  It was one I hadn't tried after living in Chicago for so long, and I'm glad I tried it.  However, it's behind Lou Malnati's and Giordano's for me.",10,1,positive
1576,"Overall disappointed. A group of six of us were excited to enjoy Pequod's pizza after seeing a movie across the street earlier tonight; the pizza fulfilled our cravings but the service left us hungry for attention. We were expecting a decent wait since six of us were going around dinner time; fortunately, the wait was only around 15-20 minutes. But then realized this table was open when we originally checked in with the host staff.Our server mentioned the pizza would take about 45 minutes and suggested the combo appetizer plate while we waited. We did order it but wouldn't suggest spending money on it. We expected the wait for the pizza to be around 45 minutes as she mentioned but in the end it took well over an hour. During our wait we asked the host staff if the Cubs game could be turned on since the Bears game was on every other TV. The original TV we asked for it to be put on was denied; however, they did put it on another TV nearby but only for 5 minutes before another guest said they wanted to watch the Bears. Considering they have several TVs which all had the Bears game on, having the Cubs who had a better chance at winning the game (and did!) didn't seem to much to ask.It took forever for us to receive our bill. The bill also included a drink that one of us ordered although it was never delivered. When we mentioned that to our waitress she first questioned us but then apologized and removed it from the bill. Overall the pizza was good; however, the service needs a lot of improvement before we will return.",9,2,negative
1577,"Very good Chicago dish deep! The only issue I have is the pizza isn't the same if you order for pick up or take your leftovers home and eat it the next day.... It must be eaten straight out of the oven in the pan. If you do happen to have leftovers reheat in a cast iron pan, you'll enjoy it much more then in the microwave or oven.",2,0,positive

1580,"I wanted to love this place! We ordered a pizza to go and had a beer at the bar while we waited. Service was friendly and accommodating. But the pizza desperately needed salt. The sauce is my favorite part of a pizza, and this one had no flavor. I loved the famed crust of course, but a good crust does not an entire pizza-eating experience make, so I won't be back.",6,1,negative

1584,"WORTH THE WAIT!I'm pretty sure i visited Chicago about three or four times before finally getting a taste of a deep dish pizza. To my delight, my boyfriend's family knew exactly where to go!If you're going to go here on a weekend (which we did), be prepared to wait for and hour or two depending on the time you get there. Luckily, there are a lot of bars and other areas you can chill and have drink while you're waiting for them to buzz you (just make sure your buzzer is still within their radius)We waited about two hours until we were finally seated. They actually have a lot of space in their building. Our table was on the second floor which i preferred more. Plus! if you go to the bathroom, they have a lord of the rings wall decor- at least the women's bathroom did...i didn't check the men's haha ANYWAY, as for the food. we ordered drinks and the Pequod's salad, which was a great light start considering we were going to carb central with all the pizza. We ordered two medium sized deep dished pizza. There were five of us and each of us ate around two slices and still had leftovers! One pizza has mushrooms, garlic and sausage. The other pizza was a simple pepperoni and cheese, but we asked for anchovies on the side as well. The pizzas itself was amazing! The dough they use is lighter than i expected, almost like focaccia but not as soft. They carmelize the crust which gives a great crunch at the end. As for the toppings, the sausage was delicious but the garlic just made that one pizza. So DO put garlic! The pepperoni and cheese was an awesome classic as well, and the anchovies was a nice touch when you add it. Overall, I was very satisfied and glad I came here for my first ever experience of a Chicago deep dish pizza!",16,1,positive
1585,"Honest review: i liked ginos east better not worth the wait or the rude service.  My one star rating means i wouldnt come back not because its the worst pizza i ever ate when i give more then a star it means id go back WARNING NO RESERVATIONS: they said u have to call and put ur name on the list that didnt do anything though cause we still got the beeper!!!! :( so a 30 minute wait turned into an hour!!!! Fml! Oh wait it gets better u cannot order ur pizza while u wait  so that means u gotta wait longerfinally hallelujah we get seated we order and guess what waiting again!!!!!!! shit litterly time stands still with all the waiting! regarding the service omg there all teenagers so there either dancing hanging out or hidding in the back caught them  funny moment. Our waiter was rude she put a bunch of utensils in a cup and slammed it down then no good recomendations or was nice at all just hi and bye n she forgot things i asked her for tabasco sauce and i was watching her just stand there n she came back a while later n im like can u plz get tabasco sauce one of the worst waiters ever avoid the pretty blond waiter .Appetizer combo: comes with jalepeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms and zucchini sticks. Surprisedly the breading on all of them is really good so that means there not frozen junk food! The seasoning on the breading is good wish it had a lil more seasoning  though. The only thing i didnt like was the zucchini it was really bland like really we didnt eat them just left them there. The marinara sauce it comes with is also really good. Pan pizza: WARNING NO BACON TOPPING it came n i was like thank god im starving already cut so u dont have to struggle to eat the pizza the crust is good not to thick not to hard just like in the middle the sauce was really delicious like really the meatballs that were on it were really tender and flavorful but there was only 1 slice of a meatball on each cut of pizza the best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese crust it was really delicious like really for once i actually ate the crust and didnt discard it. The issues with the pizza was it needed salt badly my girlfriend hates salt yet even she was like wow gimme that salt shaker another issue was the actual pizza needed more cheese like there was a really serious problem with the ratio of condiments to crust when u think of deep dish u think 10 pounds of heaven not 10 pounds of crust",27,13,negative
1586,"Cheese crusted deep dish. Bam. My first ever legit deep dish chicago style pizza in the city of chicago. I can't compare it to any other ""best chicago style pizza"" joints since I didn't have time to check those out but my foodie local friend took us here because, ""once you have cheese crusted deep dish why would you ever go back?""to lighten it up, i got only veggies on mine and it was nothing short of blissful heavenly pizza. my husband had the meat heavy topping and he enjoyed both styles. con: the immensely long wait. we sat down and waited for an eternity (maybe 45 min?) to get our pizza. but, it was also during the nhl play offs so the place was packed (chicago vs la) so perhaps it was just due to overcapacity.great, now i'm dreaming of this place.",4,0,positive
1587,"Definitely my favorite pan pizza place in Chicago! I would consider this more a pan pizza, but I can tell how it's a deep dish/pan mix. The crust looks burnt (but doesn't taste like it), and I think it's because of the deep dish pan they use. The crust is flakey and buttery, and holds up the slice just fine. I've always had the pizza cooked to perfection and taste amazing, they definitely don't cheap out on the toppings and load the pizza with what you want.They also have an amazing in-house lunch special. Just make sure you have an hour, because it probably takes minimum 20 minutes to get the pizza out (fresh cooked). I ended up getting pepperoni/jalapeno and it was simply amazing. I believe it's a 7"" personal pizza, so kudos to you if you can finish it off. It comes with a free soda as well, so it's a pretty amazing deal all around.Check this place out if you love pizza and want to experience something different from the traditional thin crust/deep dish.",14,2,positive

Let's start off, I love the atmosphere and the vibe of this place. I wish they had a bigger bar though, for both upstairs and downstairs. We made our own deep dish of spinach, chicken, and mushrooms. The sauce was bland and watery. The bread was a lil too chewy as well. Along with the disappointment of the pizza, we also got the pizza bread which is like bread sticks. My husband really liked it.

1602,"I love this place. This is my go to when out-of-town visitors want to truly experience Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza here is way better than Lou Malnati's and Giodano's. Worth coming out here and waiting in line in order to get your fix of delicious pizza. I usually go with basil, mushroom, and sausage, and I would highly recommend that combination. You will need a medium to feed about 3 people (each get 2 slices) - and trust me, you will be plenty full. Note this is deep dish, I have not given their thin crust a try. I've converted so many people to Pequod's. It the true local Chicago deep dish pizza experience. My only complaint and the only thing that's holding Pequod's from getting a five star rating is the fact that the quality sadly is not consistent. There will be times when Pequod's completely knock the ball out of the park and give you an amazing pizza, but there are also other times when the crust is burnt or not fully cooked. They don't take real reservations - you can call ahead but what happens is that you get to jump to the top of list, which will still require some wait (unlike most other restaurants, where you will have a table ready as soon as you walk in). I have ordered for pick-up in the past (it took about 50 minutes), but the pizza experience is not the same. That same day, delivery was about 2 hours. So I would plan ahead if you would like to order a pizza and eat from your home. I would say to truly experience Pequods, you have to eat the pizza there. When it pops right out of the oven, it is amazing. The long wait is crazy. I have waited 2+ hours in the past. There is a Barnes and Nobles nearby and that's where I go to hang out while waiting. It's worth it and just do it!",13,4,positive

My family and I tried to get in once since they were highly recommended after a movie at Regal, they were too busy and not friendly at all.This week, we went and finally made it! No line around 5ish pm. We had a small pan for 2 and after eating 2 small pieces, I could not move and breath the entire evening. I felt so heavy and bloated! I read the reviews and one woman was saying they don't let the crust mature and that makes you bloated, which makes sense. Basically the pizza was not done at well. It was like eating semi done crust where the cheese did not even melt. The toppings were not evenly distributed.The waitress was so indifferent, as most of the stuff, some college not caring kids.Bathroom was clean and that's the best of all, OMG.I want my money back, yes, I do. So worthless!!!!P.S. The wine list does not exist. They serve wine, but you don't know what the choices are and how much does it cost. Ridiculous!",8,5,negative

They also have a bar next door called Whales Tales where patrons can go and enjoy a few drinks while waiting to get in, think you might even get a discount if they know you're waiting to get in for pizza. The lunch special was 4.95 for a seven inch pan pizza and a drink, for this quality that's insane! Really, perhaps the best pan pizza I've ever had and it was a thing of beauty to eat and look at. Such perfect sauce, caramelized cheese and pepperoni. I also had a very good appetizer of garlic sticks and marinara. My total bill was maybe 10.65 or so. I was worried about long lines, so I got there rift when they opened at 11am on a Wednesday morning and there were only two ahead of me.

I am not sure if ""stuffed"" is synonymous with ""deep-dish"" because this pizza was definitely deep-dish but most of the depth was the bready dough vs other deep-dish pizzas that consisted of a thick layer of cheese and whatever other toppings. It is easy to get awed by the nice crispy crust of the pizza. I originally gave this 4 stars but when I came back and tasted the left overs of all my deep-dish pizzas side by side, I realized that comparatively I enjoyed it less than the others because it was mostly bread/dough.

The carmelized cheese edges are great but for me the sauce is a bit too stringent for general consumption. Also, the pan pizza is very thick and bready which makes it no light meal. Other well known pan pizza's are quite different.The thin crust disappointed me . Fairly thick crust for a thin pizza and also, quite bready and not much personality in the crust. Interestingly, the left overs were much better than fresh, IF you heat it up properly. NEVER MICROWAVE PIZZA! It turns into a soggy mess. Try putting it on a frying pan on no more than medium heat. Heat it slowly. The crust will crisp up beautifully, it will heat evenly all the way up through the toppings, and the cheese will remelt and caramelize around the edges on the pan.",9,4,negative

I overlooked it and we ordered.We ordered the stuffed crust which describes itself as cheese oozing from the crust but when we received it there was barely any cheese at all. It arrived to our table swiftly but upon our first bite, my husband and I both found a way to admit it was subpar.We decided we were full and when the waitresses walked by I said ""can we get a box and the check."" Without saying a word she used the pizza pliers to pick it up and allowed it to sit at her knee as she walked away from the kitchen with the pizza being moved around her personal space before she finally walked to the kitchen. She came back to our table without a word check on top of pizza looked away and walked off.We both looked at each other trying to figure out if we were rude to her at some point but could not think of anything as she barely came to our table in the first place.Bottom line.

The tomato sauce was overly flavored like spaghetti sauce, it was almost cloying and didn't taste natural to me. The cheese didn't have much flavor and I didn't really like the taste of the sausage either.Pequod's has a loud, lively bar-like atmosphere, it looks like a bar too.

The sauce is also delicious and there is a good balance between dough and toppings/sauce. Some places have tooo much dough or too much sauce.

1629,"Honestly, the only reason I gave it 1 star, is because there is no 0 star rating. My friends and I showed up to try what was recommended to us as Chicago's best deep dish pizza. We waited over an hour to be seated, which was expected, and when we sat down to order we were told it would take another hour for the pizza to come out.Shortly after another hour our server came back out (for the first time since she handed us our water and took our order) to tell us that the kitchen had accidentally put a couple of extra toppings on the pizza. At this point, we were fine with that, we just wanted to eat. So when the pizza came out we realized it wasn't our pizza at all; there were no mushrooms, or jalapeños like we ordered. Just a random pizza with random toppings. The crust was burnt black, and was difficult to cut through.In Nashville we have a good Chicago style deep dish restaurant that I wanted to compare to an authentic pizza place in Chicago, and hands down the Nashville restaurant won the comparison. In fact, you can't even compare the two. That would be like comparing a 5 star steak house to McDonald's. Pequods was an outright disappointment, and I regret the 2 and a half hours of my life/vacation I wasted there.",8,4,negative

1631,"It was my first visit to Chicago and my first time trying deep dish pizza. My bf had tried the big name deep dish pizza places so I suggested we try Pequods, a place he hadn't been before. Waiting for the pizza felt like forever because we were both so hungry we didn't have the energy to talk about anything except when the food would be out. Luckily we had came before the rush so it only took about 15-20 minutes which is standard btw. The pizza was amazing. They cook the crust with cheese so it's like a crispy cheese crust. Just imagine when you melt cheese in a frying pan and it turns that golden brown. Imagine a piece of that on the crust. Every bite is just the right amount of oozing cheese, pepperoni, sauce and crust. To make it better, the pizza wasn't as oily as some pizzas can be so you don't even feel guilty as you eat your second slice of deep dish and eye your third slice. :) My bf and I shared a small which was more than enough.",7,1,positive
1632,"I've had super mixed experiences with Pequod's.  The first time I tried it, it was the best deep dish I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked crust, awesome sausage, tons of cheese.  However, the last two times I ordered from them, it took almost two hours for my order to arrive, and it wasn't quite as good.  It got a bit doughy, and the crust wasn't as good as that first night.  I'll probably give it one last try for delivery, and I'm guessing it's best eaten at the restaurant, but I've had less than stellar experiences overall.",7,0,negative
1633,"It was good, very good. But my personal preference is still Malnati's. The big difference is the the crust. The crust here was thick and airy, like focaccia bread. If that's what you like, this is your place.",4,0,negative
1634,"Amazing! Worth the wait for sure, not to mention you can go to the bar next door and have a drink while you are waiting.  This is the best Chicago has to offer no doubt. The Pep/sausage was to die for!  I can't wait to visit again.",1,2,positive
1635,"It was time to try a new pizza place.  Previously a Lou Malnati's and Jet's Pizza only fan, but the last two carry-out experiences at both left me ready to explore other options.Pequod's product performed perfectly.  Totally worth the 1+ hour carry out time.  Totally worth waiting in the pickup line in the restaurant which was packed like the Red Line at rush hour.The pan pizza (their deep dish) was cooked perfectly, with the cheese just crisped just the way I like it around the edges.  The dough was appropriately cooked-through and crispy on the bottom, and offset by the heavenly layer of softness where it met the balanced sauce and toppings.  Ohh, the sauce.  Not too pasty, not too watery, with just the level saltiness and seasoning.  As with most pizza experiences, the sauce made the pizza.  Got my money's worth of toppings.  Cheese layer was thankfully just the right thickness.  The only thing I'd change would be to add the fresh basil later in the cooking process so that it didn't get so crispy too.Totally their own pizza recipe, but I might compare a little to the bumpiness, crispiness, and interest of NYC's Prince Street Pizza, and the dough recipe of Detroit's Pizza Papalis.Absolutely will be returning.",12,0,positive
1636,I had heard so many great things about this place and was super excited to try it. I had the deep dish pizza with mushroom and spinach and it was so delicious! We got the fries for an appetizer (the pizza takes about 45 minutes to make) and they were perfectly cooked and crunchy! The staff was super nice and friendly. Can't wait to go back!,8,0,positive
1637,"I absolutely love pizza and after first reading about Pequod's in Bon Appetit (my food bible), I had been jonesing to swing by for a personal pan pizza. I finally did just that and I got the lunch special for $4.95 which included a personal pan pizza and a soda. Since this was my first visit, I wanted to try the pizza with cheese only. I was quoted a 30 minute wait and it did take 30 minutes. I love burned cheese and the pizza was good, especially the crust! While it was good, in my opinion, it doesn't top Giordano's, which still ranks as my favorite deep dish pizza ever.",6,1,negative
1638,"Best deep dish pizza CRUST, by far. I'm a huge fan of the extra crispy crust with some burnt bits of cheese - I practically finish it before I've even worked on the pizza itself. So freaking delicious.Long, long lines, but definitely worth it. I've waited 2 hours on a Sunday night, and even in my hangry state, could not be unhappy with Pequods. You can call in to theoretically ""shorten"" your wait time, but when I called and later arrived, they just put my name down underneath everyone else... after confirming with me ""Ah you called, we'll let you know."" I'm doubtful of this system.NOTABLE:-Their lunch special is pretty ridiculous - I think it's like $5! - so hop on that if you can.-This one may be obvious but do not order the Pequod's Salad.

Best crust ever.  And if you don't believe my review just ask the thousand people that are there, every-time & anytime you try to go (that would be my only complaint).

1640,"Pequod's is in just the right location. It's near the Regal Cinema and other great businesses in the Chicago area. The pans they cook the pizza in caramelize the cheese and you'll find yourself abandoning your table manners and picking and pulling the ingredients off and nibbling ferociously. The items are cooked to order so it'll be at least 30 minutes for some hot and delicious memories. The staff are very nice and will try to seat you upstairs or downstairs based on your preference. Be forewarned, during peak times there can be a wait since many patrons will wait for a movie to start or watch sports as they dine. Parking is located in a nearby garage as street parking is a rarity.",5,1,positive

The wait time is a little long for their signature pan pizza, approximately 45 minutes, but it's worth it! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. In fact, when we had some left over and wanted to go watch a movie across the street, they let us keep our pizza in their fridge till we were done with the movie. This is definitely a place I'd go to again if I'm in town. Fully recommended!",6,0,positive
1642,"Heard of this place from coworkers, and I was interested in the carmelized cheese lining the crust. SO good - the pan pizzas take ~ 40min to come out, but the wait was clearly communicated and there are a lot of appetizers to choose from while you wait. The deep dish slices were surprisingly light and easy to eat. The sauce was really fresh, too. Wonderful experience!",4,0,positive
1643,"Customer service is shit. Don't get me wrong, I understand that when a restaurant has a substantial following, they give less shits about their customers, but this is ridiculous.  We ordered a pizza at 126 am, had to repeat my credit card number 6 times before she actually got it right. Then, we call to check on our order and the person can find no order for us. None. Gave our number, name we put it under, address, nothing can be found. Super pissed. Finally we get a manager on the phone. She says they guarantee it by 302am?  Ok. It's 303am, and guess what? No pizza.  We called back to see where it is and with a bitchy attitude says its in the same place that it has been the last two times you called. Fuck this place.",2,4,negative
1644,"If this review were for the pizza itself, it would be five stars. But when I called for delivery, and pulled up the delivery zone map, they refused to deliver to us. We live in Logan Square at Milwaukee and Sacramento. As you can see in the map, that is clearly within the boundaries of their delivery zone. And yet they refused to deliver. So I asked to speak to the manager, who unapologetically also refused to take the order, claiming my address ""didn't show up in their system."" You can't show one thing on your website and then just respond with ""Well I don't know what to tell ya."" Beware Logan Square residents. No Pequods for you.",1,3,negative

How was the pizza, you ask?  Some of our group came from New York.  They were inspired to start a business based on the pizza they had here. Idk how feasible it would be to order from here and then deliver it to Manhattan or Brooklyn, and have it piping hot.I'm still in the group that says ""Its just pizza, and no, if you think it's better than sex...you're not doing IT right.""A suggestion for better business and flow:Give a menu to people waiting outside.  Especially during winter. You can even have them/us order and pay while outside.  We will do it.  Why?  Because we are already hungry.  And you'll have faster table turnover, so you can seat even more people in a night.And it gives us a reason not to leave before we even get to enter.",8,2,positive

So after a $25 can ride,  I walk in the door and it's a neighborhood pizza place. Local all the way. Waitresses and hostess are polite, but not kissing your butt like you're some tourist. Beers are straight-forward. A few local selections, and the usual mass market stuff.So on to the pies: order thin or pan crust, toppings are extra, and there are lots of them.We got two pan pies: 1. Pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, fresh garlic awesomeness.2. Olives, and a bunch of other veggies for the vegetaters. After a few beers, while waiting for the pies:I watched chick ice skating on the Olympics. Gotta love that chick ice skating...The pizza: THICK crust. Burnt black at the top edges from the cast iron pan. HUGE toppings, like sausage the size of a half-dollar. Pepperoni? Yup it's on there, a lot of it. Every now and then, a sharp bit of garlic, and plenty of mushrooms goodness. Crisp bottom to the crust, but light interior. Quite a bit of dough. A lot of places do that thing where the toppings are in the middle and topped with sauce. Not here, it's definitely a pan pizza with the goodness on top.In short: This is one badass pie. I need a nap. A long one. I give it a solid 4.5 stars, and we'll see if they get that last half when I come back for the thinner crust pies.",11,0,positive

(Toppings are extra) If I am craving deep dish (though this is more pan than deep dish), this is absolutely where I want to go - if I can handle the two hour wait that usually accompanies dinner here.  I give four stars instead of five because the service is generally poor and slow.  I'm not complaining that the food takes too long to come - it's deep dish, of course it's gonna take an hour (and on busy nights, more than that).  It's that our servers aren't the most attentive and forget things that we ask for.  It happens every time I go.",12,3,positive

It was my first time at Pequod's as well and we were both equally underwhelmed. I wish I would have taken her to a Giordano's instead. We came in midday on a Saturday and were seated quickly. We started with a small order of buffalo wings, which did not particularly stand out, and then ordered a pizza for us to share. I was impressed with the topping options (including an italian beef option) but we stuck with pepperoni and peppers. Once it arrived, the pizza was soupy and we were disappointed to see it was mostly breading. Perhaps it would have benefited from a few more minutes in the oven, but overall there was just too much sauce.Bottom line: definitely overrated and closer to being a Detroit style pizza.",3,3,negative

1681,"UPDATE: This place got featured on food network as one of AMERICA'S TOP FIVE PIZZA JOINTS! SO IF YOUR EVER IN THE AREA MAKE SURE TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT!!!So everyone knows that Chicago is known for their deep dish pizzas and there is a plethora of pizza joints running amok in Chitown. There's Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, Giordianios, and the list just goes on and on. Everybody has their opinion of what is the best and their favorite. The best pizza joints compete and some really might be better than each other by honestly the difference of what constitutes ""better"" is literally by a thin thread. That's why I was on the hunt for a deep dish pizza that was truly unique and I found it at Pequod's!Their service was horrible and the way hostess and managers run the business just lacked class and professionalism. You can tell they were flabergasted with the crowd of lines waiting to get this pizza. We decided to To GO our pizza and just eat it inside the hotel. No worries! The cheese was still gooey when we opened it.This pizza is truly unique and is baked in a black pan. The inside rim of the pan is sprinkled with mozzarella cheese and that is what makes their infamous caramelized crust. It might not be for everyone because my friend wasn't such a fan. She thought it just tasted burnt. (btw she doesnt really like food that much so her opinion is not valid). I, however, LOVED THE CRUST. It was chewy, salty, and flavorful. I liked the crust so much that when I was too full from my pizza, I took the crust off the other slices and just munched away on the crust.",7,3,positive
1682,"So our waitress was a real sweetie, but overall we waited about 45 minutes to get in around 6pm (earlier than peak according to Google), then when we ordered, we were told it was going to be about an hour for a deep dish pizza. It's understandable I suppose, but the folks across from us sat down much later than us and their deep dish came about ten minutes earlier than ours. When ours arrived it was definitely not the temperature we'd assumed it would be (we both had fun picking up the pan with our bare hands) and we really questioned what all the hype over this place is about once we'd had a slice. I'm not an expert, but I did have my first deep dish just 4 days before coming to this place and enjoyed it much more. At Pequod's, the crust is flavorless and takes up about 75% of the height of the dish. We were expecting much more sauce and much more cheese. And much more flavor. Overall the only thing not disappointing about this place was the sausage and the whale shaped mozzarella cheese they'd grated on the salad.",3,2,negative
1683,"I dislike most of the pizza in Chicago. I never seek it out and rarely enjoy it. The style is so, so hard to get right and most places aren't consistent at all. It makes pizza reviews rather ephemeral. Pequod's is my favorite of them all.",4,2,positive
1684,Two or so hours wait and our pizza was cold in the middle. Crust is just crumbly and soggy.

1685,"Burnt awesomeness! That burnt looking edge on your deep dish pizza slice? don't cut that off and throw it away. Pequod's secret to an intensely flavored crust is that the pizza masters apply a thin layer of cheese along the sides of the pan. While the resulting flavor is just decent, the texture is ahh-mazing! This caramelization gives a great contrast to the very thick and dense pie. By the time we arrived at Pequod's (after hitting THREE other pizza joints) I was quite full. So, I opted for the spinach version while the bf had the sausage/pepperoni pie. Being that the crust is pretty hefty, some might feel that you need more sauce or more cheese to balance it out, but it was perfect for me since I LOVE carbs. ;-)Located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, it's a locals hangout but you'll spy the occasional tourists (us!) Definitely worth the train or car ride from tourist central Michigan ave. Go to Pequod's -- crispy cheese crust or bust.",7,3,positive

Being deep dish, there was also a wait after you order but the server said ordering just cheese may make the wait shorter. We got some salad and waited less than a half hour for pizza. The sauce was really good, and the crust wasn't as filling as other deep dish spots I've had. Overall, worth it to check out!",6,0,positive
1688,"Over 3,000 reviews and over 1000 pictures - is this a tourist attraction or has this place been getting reviews since the beginning of yelp? As someone who has not tried chicago deep dish ever before, I was kind of disappointed. Was going to put 2 stars but since the description for ""Meh, I've experienced better"" doesn't apply to me since I've never had deep dish, decided to give it an ""A-OK"" rating. Don't get me wrong - i LOVE pizza, and I LOVE crust, but if all deep dish pizza is like the ones at Pequod's, then I may just be a thin crust fan. First of all, the caramelized crust just tasted like crispy crackers, and the crust in its entirety tasted like flavored croutons - super crunchy and not the stretchy, flavorful soft crust that I was expecting. Biting into a pizza I usually expect a chewy and yeasty texture to crust, but here the crust was more like...toast. The toppings were good, they were pretty generous on the meat, and the cheese was wonderfully stringy and generous. Environment is amazing for watching sports (we came on the day that the Cubs won! haha this place is better for late night) and drinking beer, but if all deep dish has disappointing crust like this then maybe I'm just not a fan of deep dish pizza in general :( Will try other deep dish places to compare!",17,3,negative
1689,I grew up on pizza from the south side but I can't lie this place was very good. The thin pizza was alright but the pan pizza was delicious. I prefer my pizza well done and it came out just right. Wings were also a hit I really can't complain about this place besides the parking and wait to sit down.,5,1,positive

1691,"4.5 stars, would need to visit more to see if it's 5 stars. Happy that they accept reservations. Really loud (we were seated upstairs). But the pizza, my goodness.sausage and pepperoni deep-dish ($19 for medium 12"") - 4.5 stars. Caramelized cheese crust was f-ing incredible. It looks burnt, but without any of that bitter burnt taste. I approved of the toppings-to-bread ratio (I don't want foccaccio, yo!). Sausage, pepperoni, cheese, sauce, everything was on point. The crust and base had the crisp & softness of a pan pizza.I know in my heart of hearts that I will be back. That is a promise!",3,1,positive

1693,"Man I've been DIEIN' to try this place. As a self proclaimed yet extremely humble pizza snob, I'm always on the hunt for the next best slice.  Pequod's on the weekend is a nightmare- SUPER crowded and long wait times (we left our first visit there after being told we'd have to wait 2 hours for a table).  We gave it another go this past Sunday afternoon and were seated right away, which was awesome.  The waitress was nice, the Pequod salad was good (homemade Italian and Ranch were on point).  We ordered the pan style pizza with half pepperoni, half sausage.  Wait time was typical.  Finally got to try the infamous blackened cheese crust! Was the pizza good? Yah! Was it something I'd rave about, wait 2 hours for in a super crowded restaurant for, or drive back to try? Probably not. Honestly I was missing the crunchy, buttery crust a deep dish usually has, and the blackened crust just left me wanting something I wasn't gonna get.  It's good pizza, it was a great dining experience and I'm glad we tried it out, but I'd say we're a one and done here.  :)",11,4,negative
1694,"Pizza is amazing but customer service leaves much to be desired. I ordered a pizza to be delivered at a certain time to a certain bar at a specific time, to ensure that someone was there to recieve it. They delivered the pizza 40 minutes early when no one was from our party was even at the bar. I called their location once I learned of this early delivery and told them that it was unacceptable as no one was there to recieve it and was asked to be delivered around a certain time for a reason, which I was told was you ok when I asked before ordering the pizza. When I called the location to report the descrepency of delivery and asked to talk to a manager I was first transferred to someone who was not a manager then hung up on when I requested a manager again. When I called i.immediately back and asked for a manager the manager gave me an attitude about their discrepancy and was told that another pizza would be delivered at the original requested time to compemsate , to which as of now 3 hours later it still has not been delivered and their customer service leaves much to be desired. Therefore I am giving them 1 star purely on their customer service and inability to maintain their worrd.",1,3,negative
1695,"I love Pequods. But I have a few reasons for not giving 5 stars, even though I want to. I am a vegan so I was DELIGHTED to find that I could eat their deep dish pizza. The crust is one of my favorites and the sauce is so flavorful that it makes me salivate like crazy. That is all I can comment on since I usually just get a completely plain pizza, no cheese. I could add veggies I suppose. The price is okay, deep dish is usually more $$. I wish they offered vegan cheese! Also, be prepared to wait a good 40 minutes or more. It is worth it. OH and there are two levels, it is quite a cosy place.",4,1,positive
1696,"Came here for dinner alone (lol) after a TON of people recommended it to me while being in Chicago. Arguably there is a bit of a competition between this + a couple of the other more popular pizza joints, but I decided to go with what I was hearing majority of people recommending.Ambiance is very ""local."" Nothing exquisite or decorated or curated or charming, but felt very Chicago. Don't really know how to describe that. It was packed - came around 8pm on a weekday, but luckily was seated pretty quickly since I was just 1. Most there were in families/bigger groups. I ordered the personal size deep dish cheese pizza. It was absolutely DELICIOUS. Caramelized butter crust (that is thick and chewy, but not overly so like some other deep dish pizza joints) and a solid amount of cheese (again... not too much cheese). Overall, loved my experience here and would definitely recommend. I easily scarfed down the personal size pizza for myself (but I also am a pretty big eater - probably would have been good to split this with 1 other person, or save 1 slice of pizza for the next day. But it was just too good!)Pretty affordable as well.Would highly recommend to someone wanting an authentic Chicago experience that doesn't feel too ""done up."" Great tasting pizza doesn't hurt either ;)",15,2,positive
1697,"I currently live in NY but I'm not a thin crust die hard-- I actually prefer deep dish. More sauce, more cheese, even more bread, what's not to like?? But I was somewhat disappointed with Pequod's, which was recommended by multiple Chicago-resident friends. The fact is, I didn't think it was a great deep dish pizza, let alone a destination deep dish pizza.We ordered a cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer which I wholeheartedly preferred to the pizza. It was warm, melty, and garlicky, and suuuper cheesy. The pizza we ordered (which I also think is ridiculous that each topping is about an additional $2.00) was impressive in its presentation, but not as flavorful, and more bread than anything else, although the edges were crispy with crisp almost-burnt cheese. I thought it would be saucier and have a sort of doughy inner that kind of melded with the tomato sauce, with a crisp bottom, but I was sadly disappointed.The pizza does take a while to come out. Highly recommend getting an appetizer or two to hold you over. And definitely throw out your expectations of getting a nutritious, healthy meal if you're coming here. I felt my arteries clog just sitting in the place with all the scent and grease this place accumulated over the years.",11,8,negative
1698,"It's okay. The place is consistently packed with people coming & going and the pizza IS good, but it lacks when you compare it to some of the other pizza places on the south side (Nick & Vitos, Milano's, Russo's, Fox's, Beggar's, Giordano's). Because of this, I feel it is overpriced for what it is. I didn't like the northside yuppie crowd so much, but the service was pretty good despite it being constantly busy which was surprising! Kuddos to the servers for putting up with all that madness! In conclusion it's not a bad place, but it's also not someplace I would go out of my way for.",5,1,negative

1710,"It was super busy when we came in for our reservation on Sunday. We still had to wait a little which was no big deal. For an appetizer we had the cheese bread and a salad, both were decent. Our table ordered three personal deep dish pizza's which took over an hour before we were served and each one was missing a topping. In fact, the table of four that was seated after us got their pizza's first. I'm guessing our server put our order in late and even wrong. Despite all that, the pizza's were full of fresh toppings and the crust is amazing! The sauce just soaked into the bread, but it wasn't soggy. And it was even better the next day, you don't even need to heat it up. I would definitely come back for another pie. Hopefully I won't have to wait so long to get my pizza next time.",5,1,positive

I honestly don't understand this logic.After we saw a party of 4 walk in and get seated at a 6 person table before us, we left.I'm sure the food is great, but I can't say, I never found out.

1718,"I was drawn to Pequod's because of its $4.95 lunch special. The lunch special is a personal one-topping deep dish pizza and a drink of your choice. What a deal. The pizza is enough for 2 people, and the drink comes with free refills. I ordered the deep dish with giardiniera peppers, and this was the perfect combination of mozzarella cheese baked into the pizza ""crust"" shell. The peppers and sauce are on top of the pizza, and there was a good ratio of peppers to sauce. The sauce is well-seasoned, and not overly sweet or spicy. Pequod's is located in a line of businesses on a busy street. There is street parking nearby. The establishment itself is dimly lit, which gives it a bar-like feel. There is a full service bar and flat screen TVs showing sports games above the bar. The space itself is small, but I would recommend it for a meeting with friends as many people were doing or just a solo lunch. The service is fast and friendly, and your pizza arrives in 20 minutes with no wait.",9,0,positive

1720,"Even though I'm a thin crust girl all the way, I figured I should still know about deep dish if I was going to live in Chicago.  We finally tried Pequod's last month.  It gets pretty crowded so we went on a random weekday for an early dinner.  We were seated upstairs (it was a little difficult for me to climb the narrow staircase since I was 40 weeks pregnant) in a table for two in the middle of the room since all of the booths were taken by larger parties. This was better than sitting downstairs at a high top table.  Even though it was busy, it wasn't crowded yet, but it still took a while for the server to come greet us and again more time for her to take our orders, get the check, etc.We started with an order of the Caesar Salad (I forgot if it was the half or full order) then split a small 10"" deep dish with sausage.  The crust was caramelized and crispy and held the sauce, cheese, and toppings well.  I was only able to eat one quarter while Hubby ate two and we took the remaining slice to go.  Pretty good for deep dish.  I would be interested to return and try their thin crust or even the lunch special 7"" personal pan cheese pizza and a soda for $4.95.",5,4,negative
1721,"Usually not a fan of Chicago style pizza, but Pequod's pan pizza is oh so good.  As others have stated, its the crust that makes this stuff so crack-like good.  If, you know, you're into crack and all.  The crust is flakey and buttery on the bottom, but the prize is the burnt cheese crust on the edges.  Seriously, you need to monitor your fellow diners to make sure they're not stealing the burnt cheese crust edges of pieces that do not belong to them.  I know from experience.Ok, ok...its not all about the crust, 'bout the crust....   In addition, Pequod's is generous with the toppings and their sauce is good, too.  I've only had the pan pizza, and only delivery, so I can't comment on the other food items or dining in.  And the delivery can take up to 2 hrs on a Friday evening.  And yes, it was worth every darn minute of the wait.  Like crack, you gotta wait for your fix!",6,4,positive

They're usually pretty busy so i definitely recommend preparing to wait an hour or so on the weekends.

I've found that Giordanos has too much cheese and not enough tomato sauce, and I don't like the buttery crust of Lous so this is my perfect deep dish pie. Perfect ratios of all the pizza elements with a cheesy halo, what more could you ask for? It's a bit of a wait and it's just street parking but it's worth it.",7,1,positive

Yes this is deep dish, not possible to do it with your bare hands, well yes you can but it will be a mess!The deep dish pizza is good but it makes you bloated after a second piece.

All the sausage is specially made with their recipe from a local meet place in Chicago. It will take some time to get the food so be patient. Staff is great and efficient.

1731,"SO OVERRATED.First of all, the fact that everyone raves about this place as the best pizza place in Chicago is pure bs. This was my first trip to Chicago and I've been hearing that this place and Lou Mal something are supposed to be the best. Boy was I SO DISAPPOINTED! I should've known when I arrived at this tiny hole in the wall looking bar scene that the fact that this place has more than 3 thousand reviews is a little suspicious and most likely due to some incentive given for checking in or writing a good review. Anyways, on to the pizza. So my husband  and I were super excited to try some really good authentic Chicago pan pizza. We ordered the cheese with mushrooms onions and olives. Visually, the pizza looked kind of dull and grayish all over, which I do not know why since all the veggies are supposed to make it look colorful. TASTE: SO BLAND and BARELY ANY CHEESE !!!!! I felt like I was eating a fat piece of bread with veggies on it. The bread to cheese ratio is so off. I hate pizza that does not have enough cheese that's the fun part ! Eating the gooey cheese with a good amount of sauce and a nice balanced crust. But anyways, this is what killed it for me. Pizza Hut has more flavor than this place sadly to say. CRUST: The ONLY good part was the outer burnt edges of the pan pizza. The pan dough that the pizza is baked on however, was so bland and nothing special. COST: What also was annoying is the fact that they charge $2 which so much for each topping and they have no options to choose from, only cheese and you pick whatever toppings you want. They already charge $16 for a medium which is way overpriced anyways. For such a tiny hole in the wall they charge so much. The place definitely does not reflect the quality or taste of the pizza. Overall Review: DO NOT get fooled by the massive amount of reviews. That's the only reason I picked this place as our first Chicago pizza experience over Lou Malnatis or any other famous ones. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY here ! I honestly am so baffled at how in the heck this place is famous. SO DISAPPOINTED.",18,11,negative
1732,"My friend said that this was his favorite Chicago deep dish. Having been disappointed by both Giordano's and Lou Malnati's, I was eager to try this place. Our waitress noted that the pizza takes 40 minutes to bake, so we opted to order an appetizer. We got the sampler that came with mozzerella sticks, mushrooms, poppers, and zucchini... all of which were fried and of a similar quality that you would get at Denny's. Luckily we didn't have to spend that much time eating the appetizer because 25 minutes later, our pizza arrived! Wait, I thought it took 40 minutes, but whatever we dug in. We got a pretty standard sausage, mushroom, peppers and basil, They really piled on the toppings and the sausage chunks were huge and looked home made. The first bite was delicious until I got to the uncooked dough, a nice layer right beneath the cheese and right above the rest of the cooked crust that was still mushy and raw. Well it was in the center of the pizza so maybe it was just that part. 2nd bite, uncooked. 3rd bite, uncooked. 4th bite, uncooked. It was at this point that we asked our waitress to return the pizza to the oven to cook more and she was kind to oblige. 5 minutes later (for a total of 30 minutes oven time), our pizza came back piping hot. But that layer of uncooked dough was still there. Yes, the caramelized crust (read: burnt cheese) is delicious, but the sauce and the rest of the pizza are nothing to write home about. Sorry Chicago, but for me, Cali deep dish still reigns supreme.",10,2,negative

1736,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a super big fan of pizza, no matter it's shape or form, but I can appreciate a good deal when I see it. My wife and I wanted to experience the Chicago Deep Dish pizza and found this place to be well loved by the Yelp community. First of all, if you are relying on public transportation, be willing to go on a mini hike across the LePaul campus to get to this little gem. We came here on a weekday, just barely making it to the lunch specials, which was a personal 7"" cheese pizza for less than $5. That is freaking amazing! Of course, we splurged a little bit more, added numerous toppings, and got a small side salad for $2 and a local, honey infused root beer. Alright, I wasn't a big fan of the salad or the root beer, but it wasn't that bad either. You can see from the menu that Pequod makes each pizza individually, with a minimum wait of 30 minutes to accommodate for the toppings. I initially thought we'd be safe from that wait time since the restaurant was fairly empty (which is unusual, based on the reviews), but I guess the wait time is unique to a deep dish pizza. MY biggest disappointment, aside from the pizza being salty, was that it was served on a regular plate, instead of a deep dish. Ok, so 7"" pizza may not have needed it, but it would have given an unique illusion of a deep dish pizza. We eagerly scarfed down the pizza and found it to be perfect sufficient for the two of us. Unfortunately, I got incredibly nauseous a few hours after lunch, so I had to dock a point for that. Food: 3 starsPrice: 4 starsAmbiance: 3 starsService: 3.5 stars.",14,5,positive

On top of that, I asked if I could order a pizza to-go at the very beginning of our visit, knowing that the pizzas take a while to cook, and she laughed and replied with ""Remind me to do that later, I won't remember"". I assumed she would come back at least once while we ate so I can do so, but she never came back to check up on us. She came back at the very end with our checks. I then reminded her about the to-go pizza and she sighed and explained that it would've been easier to just give me the check she had ready for me. After giving her a confused look,  she then reassured me she can add it on. I asked her to order the same pizza I previously ordered and she said ""oh it's so cute how you think I remember what pizza you got"" (as she's holding my check that clearly says the pizza I had just ordered).How does this lady still have a job?! So rude!! Wish I got her name. Hope the owner reads these reviews.. I was at table 22 from ~2-4 o clock on Thursday December 28th.

1740,I was in Chicago for a business trip and wanted to try some Chicago style pizza.  Our Uber driver told us Pequod's was the place and he was right.  I love good pizza and this may have actually been the best Pizza I have ever had.  If you are in Chicago and have the time (45 min wait for us) it is worth it!,5,0,positive

1743,"We decided to go with Pequods for deep dish after several recommendations from my local friends. The other options as many of you looking for pizza in Chicago May know are Lous, Giordannos and other small pizza joints. Let me start with the wait time, we arrived on Saturday around 6:45pm at which point we were told that the wait time would be anywhere between 2 to 2 and a half hours but before receiving a pager we had to come back to check in an hour before our estimated time of seating. 2 hours and later and we finally receive a pager and we get seated around 9:40pm. That's almost 3 hours of wait time just to be seated. After being seated we have to wait another hour just to get the pizza. Anyone who knows the place might say that because it was a Saturday the wait was expected and that's my fault for making the conscientious decision to stay and wait, however I stayed due to the high reviews. Here is where the pizza does not merit the wait. The pizza crust had a good taste but it was very hard to chew. The taste of the entire pizza was underwhelming despite having pepperoni, meatballs, onions, mushrooms and green peppers. Hope this helps anyone deciding to try this place. In my opinion it's overrated.",4,2,negative
1744,"I'm not a native Chicagoan, but to me this is the best pizza in Chicago. I'm not a fan of deep dish so Pequod's pan pizza is my go-to. Whenever friends or family come to visit we love having an excuse to get Pequod's. The dough has a great bite and the edges get caramelized to crunchy cheesy perfection.  I'm pretty sure it's understood in our house that stealing the amazing cheesy bit of crust from someone's slice is unforgivable. We always get their sausage as a topping. I think they make it themselves and it has so much fennel. Yum! Also - the salad! They cut the cheese into little whales. Love it. The only advice I would give on this place is that the pizza is so much better if you go have it in the restaurant vs. delivery.",7,4,positive
1745,"Really casual atmosphere, plenty of room inside, but expect a wait due to this places popularity.Service was great and the prices were reasonable. Came here as part of a bachelor party weekend, and 9 dudes definitely grubbed down.

1747,"Wow! Pequods! Finally!! After a very long time of anticipating Pequod's pizza and taking our out of town guests, I would say Pequods should not be rated as a deep dish pizza because it is not a deep dish pizza. It's like compare apples to oranges.  The pizza is delicious and one of the best pan pizzas, had a little resemblance to Pizza Hut's pan date I say, but it does.  My favorite Chicago deep dish is still definitely Lou Manalti's and Giordianno's! Will I go to Pequods again?? Of course!!! It was a great pizza. If we were to just talk about pizza's, Pequods is in my top 3. Yum!",6,0,positive

1749,"Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing - we didn't have enough time for deep dish so we got the thin crust. I've never in my life had a piece of pizza I didn't think was worth finishing - even elementary school pizza. I subscribe to the pizza/sex mentality - even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. Not the case with this pizza - it was not worth finishing and I didn't even try.",5,2,negative
1750,"Great pizza! My husband and I love this place but only get it once in a while because we try to stay relatively healthy. So when we do order we are really looking forward to it. I've had them deliver to my home before, but this time I'm being told I'm outside of the delivery zone. When I  checked their website I found that  I am well within the zone. I call back to clarify and am immediately met with an attitude (I guess I was annoying them. Idk. This was a different person). When I asked what exactly their boundaries were the person hung up 9 on me. I call back again because now I'm upset and want to talk to a manager. I'm immediately put in hold and a manager answers. I inform her that her staff is hanging up on people and that's when she again starts saying that I'm outside of the zone. So I inform at this point I'm no longer interested in their product and was simply asking a question to her staff. That's when I get a full explanation about a glitch in the system that is making things difficult for them. If that full explanation had been given the first time, instead of me getting shut down for asking questions, I might go back. But they've lost my business for good. Staff seemed to really care less about turning away business.",4,5,negative

They sat 5 of us at a 2 seat table, then tried to put one of our pizzas on a chair because there wasn't enough space in the table.  The manager trued to make it better but he just gave us an over cooked pepperoni pizza and threw undercooked sausage on it, there was barely any sauce on the pizza. My family was visiting from out of town and we went there because I heard great things. The pizza sucks. Little Caesar's is better than this place.",5,2,negative

The crust was delicious, and the filling was gooey yumminess.  The four of us split a large (way too big for us), and we split the pizza in half.  Half was Italian Beef + Giardiniera, and the other was Spinach, fresh garlic, and mushrooms.  Both sides were amazing.  Thinking about it makes me hungry, and I wish I could have some now. :(  Come to Dallas, Pequod's!!!",5,2,positive

After asking for her opinion on a few items and getting such a salty response all I wanted was to have her leave our table and stop ruining the happy vibe we had that night. Its a shame because there are a lot of people who would love to have a job these days....If the owners are reading my review put the server with the attitude in check....server number AZ010 on my receipt",9,2,positive
1755,Pan pizza like you dreamed of. Lots of toppings. Mine had peppers onions meatballs and sausage. Started with a Caesar salad. Followed it with the crispy crust deep dish. Be ready to wait an hour but worth the wait. Trust me when I tell you there's very little that believe is worth a long wait. I'm an instant gratification kind of guy. This was worth it. Parking is on street and a challenge. Find a way to get there.,6,0,positive
1756,"Pizza and bruschetta were good. Waitress was nice. We were seated upstairs - sign on the entrance said they're open until 2am. No one told us the upstairs closed at 11pm so we were taking our time, completely unaware. When we realized we were the only ones left we asked the waitress and finished quickly to get out but overheard one of the workers - small guy with a puffy bob - talking to our waitress about how ""these bitches are taking their time"". Just make sure customers are aware of the different closing times. No need to be passive aggressive.",2,1,negative
1757,"If you are in the mood for deep dish, Pequod's is hands down the best in Chicago. That burnt crust is one of a kind. However, you will need to work to get your pie with waits frequently over an hour. Love the pizza...hate the wait.",2,1,positive

1761,"This is the best of the best of the best... provided you order it fresh, at the restaurant. I dislike bar atmospheres, which this place definitely has, but I more than tolerate the dark, the noise, the raucousness for the sheer sublimity of this perfect expression of Chicago Pizza. The platonic ideal, to wax philosophical. It's also more than worth the long wait/the long prep time if you call ahead (recommended). It's a chain, but *barely,* with just one other location--the original, in the suburbs. Nothing like the tourist-friendly polish of Giordano's/Lou's, with a freezer in the front for tourists to ship ""authentic Chicago""!!!! pizza souvenirs to their buddy Joe in Montana. Now, it's well-known that the mere fact of being geographically served within Chicago's city limits does not a true Chicago Pizza make. There are four or five valid choices, in order of my personal preference: Pequod's, Giordano's, Uno's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's. The final four in that list are pretty close in ranking, and reasonable people can quibble about the order. Pequod's is in the #1 slot by leaps and bounds. Be prepared for a thick, doughy, bready crust which caramelizes to crisp perfection. It's not ""burnt"" and won't give you cancer. Just exquisitely cooked cheese and tomato sauce. The deepest pan of all deep-dish joints. Fresh ingredients (I usually order with double mushroom, broccoli, and garlic). And the most FILLING pizza you've ever had. Two or three slices are all most people can handle.As I said at the start, this pizza is really best eaten fresh. Ordered as delivery or takeout and reheated at home still results in an excellent, exceptional pie... but a good chunk of the magic is lost and it becomes more in-line with the others.",22,3,positive
1762,"Came here in the middle of December for what my Chicago friends said is very good deep dish. Actually their exact words were ""this is where Chicagoans go"" Was not expecting this at all. Pizza was very good but it is not deep dish....I know shocking right? It's a stuffed pie not deep dish, and yes there is a difference. Nevertheless it's still a really interesting take on a classic, one that I wasn't aware of til that fateful winter night. Go, be happy and enjoy ""stuffing"" your face.",7,2,positive
1763,"My mom is in town visiting from Texas. She saw this place on the Travel Network and wanted to give it a try. I'm not a huge deep dish fan but that's what my mom wanted so we got it. I prefer/love Lou Malnati's. This pizza taste like they got a loaf of bread put some toppings over it and stuck it in the oven. The cheese was overdone around the sides (my mom said that's there ""thing"" which was weird to me but I digress). We ordered delivery and it took about 2 hours to get here, which isn't terrible given how long it takes to make deep dish pizza. The woman who took our order seemed rushed and unpleasant. The sausage was good, therefore maybe I'll go back and try thin crust one day. I told my mom that as a Chicagoan I would be ashamed if someone from out of town tried this and thought this was what deep dish is about.",2,5,negative

The chicken wings and fried mushrooms are my favorite though. Every time I've been there, the service is great.

1769,"I'm a big fan of Lou Malnati's for deep dish and it's my go to place but I kept hearing great things about Pequois and wanted to give it a try. The wait on a Saturday was pretty long (we were quotes 2 hours but it ended up being 1 hour). There's a Barnes and Nobles across the street so you can pass the time there. The restaurant/bar is pretty small although there is an upstairs I didn't see. We got down to business and ordered a small sausage along with a Pequod salad. The salad was standard and the whale cheese was a cute touch. The deep dish was generous and delicious. That infamous caramelized crust lived up to the hype, the crust is lighter than Lou's, and the sauce is bright and flavorful. I was bummed the sausage wasn't an entire layer like at Lou's but that might be personal preference. Overall, really good deep dish that I think will win over devotees and first timers alike. A fun atmosphere that is a great place to grab a few drinks and eat some pizza.",13,2,positive
1770,Love the pizza and wings!!!  Service is okay. Wait for delivery is usually 1:45 minutes so I end up picking it up which isn't ideal because It's usually a mad house in there. If they could improve the delivery service I'd give five stars for sure.,2,0,positive
1771,"If I were to come down from a mountaintop and found a religion, I would never be more certain of anything in my life than I am of the unassailable quality of this pizza.

1774,"Me and my BF decided to get carry out from this place as a Saturday night treat. I called to order and was told it would be an hour and 15minute wait for a carry out pizza. I was a little shocked but said it was fine since neither of us were starving. We arrived to pick it up at exactly the 1 hour 15mins mark and were treated by hoards of people crowding the entrance and spilling out onto the street. Once inside, it made sense. It was a Saturday night and this place is a little on the smaller side, so lots of people were waiting to be seated. I over heard the hostess saying it was a 1.5-2hour wait for a table, wow.We ended up waiting in a slow-moving line to pick up our pizza. It was a little annoying how long it took to simply pick up a carry out pizza. And, we were lucky out order was actually ready when we got there. Some people had to wait even longer after paying for their order to be ready. Also, this place isn't super expensive, which I like. I'm pretty sure a medium pan pizza is only $16. The only outrageous thing is that each extra topping adds like $2.50, which adds up quickly. We paid $23 for a medium pepperoni and sausage pizza.Once we finally got the pizza, it was good! I really really love the crust on this pizza. It's the best pan pizza crust I've ever had--nice and dark, but not burnt, and super crispy. I also loved the quality of the ingredients: nice, huge chunks of tasty Italian sausage and literally the entire pizza was covered in pepperoni which was awesome. The sauce was also good. My only complaint is that I felt the pizza was super skimpy on cheese at some points I was like, does this pizza even have cheese on it!? But seriously, this pizza is damn good.Overall, I'd avoid this place on the weekend unless you're willing to wait 1-2+hours for your meal! But definitely check it out on a week night, this pizza isbomb!!",20,9,positive
1775,"I came here, because I've always heard great things about this place. I would definitely direct friends from out of town to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's though. I don't know if my experience was out of the ordinary, but the service was not great as the waitress was not attentive & the deep dish was very dry and bland. It also took about an hour for our pizza to come out.",3,1,negative
1776,"Got a large pan pizza, half pepperoni, half mushrooms and green peppers. It's appropriately filled up 4 people, and compared to the other major pizza spots around town it was actually a little bit cheaper(large pizza w/2 toppings $24.65). The first bites were actually pretty amazing; the cheese by then was still very gooey and, being a pan pizza, the crust was crisp but also incredibly fluffy. It's not like the buttercrust at Lou's where you have something of a more pot-pie consistency, this is straight up large pan pizza. Also, was a little skeptical about the caramelized cheese crust at first, but after trying it I'm a fan. Not as incredibly amazing as most people say it is(I mean, at that point you can't really even taste that it's cheese), but the texture is great and I think I'd prefer it to other deep dish pizzas in that regard(after all, you're still getting plenty of the thicky doughy goodness on the base of the pizza...no need to have more on the sides). The pepperoni were nothing special, and would opt for the sausage next time.One dangerous downside...after initially amazing first few slices, once it cools down a little bit you actually realize how much of it is actually dough compared to filling. Whereas with say giordano's you really have a ton of sauce and toppings and the pizza dough is maybe 1/3 the width of the entire pizza, here it's the opposite; the dough actually accounts for like 75% of the height. Once it cools down this becomes very apparent, as you notice the thin layer of cheese and toppings compared to the dough. That said it's all super fluffy so it doesn't feel as if there is that ratio upon eating it, but it does take its toll after a while.So final deep dish verdict? Actually a fan, and would say this hits the right price point too. Only major cons are that I didn't get the sausage(not their fault), and that there is a lot of (albeit very fluffy) dough which makes the ratio seem a bit off.",16,6,positive
1777,"Pequods has been on my bucketlist for a while now and today I finally got to experience the deep dish and it did not disappoint! First off this restaurant has 2 floors, the bottom floor was really busy so we were asked if we would like to sit upstairs and so we did. There were TVs to keep us busy while we were waiting for the personal deep dish pizza. The lunch special of $4.95 a personal cheese pizza with a fountain drink is an absolute steal and I really enjoyed it. The crust is the best deep dish crust I have tasted to date, it is soft and it melts in your mouth. Everything about the deep dish is delicious from the cheese to the sauce to the crust. It is also very filling! I will definitely be coming back here.",5,2,positive
1778,"What's the all the hype about Pequod's? It's not even deep dish - it's a pan pizza. Seriously, check the menu. It's a pan pizza than a traditional Chicago deep dish so there is a lot of dough - kind of like focaccia bread. There are two things going for their pizza - the burnt cheese/crust and the tomato sauce. Yes, burnt food can lead to cancer but it tastes so good. Why can't things like cheese and butter be good for you? The pizza is generously drenched in the tomato sauce but I didn't mind because it was thick, robust, and zesty. I would eat a bowl of pasta topped with the sauce since it was that good. If DePaul students weren't spoiled enough, the Lincoln Park location is open until 2am on the weekends vs. the 10pm hour at the Morton Grove location. Pequod's - not quite a true Chicago deep dish pizza but still good.",10,3,positive

1783,"I've been to Pequod's a few times before and was excited to go with some friends who were in from out of town this weekend. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday and were a bit surprised to find there was already a 30 - 45 minute wait for a party of 5. (This was the point we should've just gone somewhere else.)We were seated at 5pm and ordered our pizza and an appetizer around 5:15. No one mentioned a longer wait time on food that evening. The appetizer came out almost immediately and then our server all but disappeared.Around 6:15 I was able to flag her down and ask if she knew the status of our pizza, expecting it to be up soon. She came back about five minutes later to tell us she wasn't sure what had happened but a manager would be coming. A manager then came with nothing to report, returning again to tell us that the ticket was lost, they didn't do it on purpose, and it would be out in ten minutes. He also vented to us about their three hour wait for a table. (Uh, maybe because you can't keep orders straight in your kitchen?) When a member of our group expressed his frustration, he said he'd ""do something for us"" on the bill.Look, I've worked in the service industry. I get that people make mistakes. But the manager couldn't even be bothered to apologize! Our food eventually came about 90 minutes after we ordered it, and the pizza was good, but it wasn't worth the inattentive service and long wait.Aaaaaand then the bill came -- with no discount given despite the manager's promise to do something for us. We paid it all and just left because we were all ready to go home at that point.It'll be a long time before I visit again.",6,3,negative
1784,"Really is as good as it gets. No specialty pizza needed. Classic cheese, sausage or pepperoni is enough to make anyone believe that the pan pizza is the perfect style pizza there is.

There's a lot of pizza there.I'd eat it at least once a week if it was more conveniently located!!",5,1,positive

1791,"Hipster atmosphere. Crowded most times we go. Decent crafts beers. Great deep dish pizza with primo ingredients. Could argue that this is the best pizza joint in Chicago. Expect about a 45-60 minute wait once you order your pizza. I usually get a deep dish [pan pizza] w/ extra cheese, sausage and pepperoni. The ingredients are huge too. Not those little sausage balls at Pizza Hut. I don't order extra cheese at any other pizza spot but here i think it's necessary. Just don't think it's enough cheese on their pan pizzas. Pizzas come out great every time. The only downside is that once you wait an hour for your pizza by the time it gets there is still too hot to eat so you end up waiting longer to eat it.  Fml. But with great conversation and a few drinks you'll be eating in no time. Really enjoy this spot. Would recommend a few more beer selections but that's just being picky. Definitely  a must go to  spot in Chicago.Almost forgot to mention the cheese melted to edge of the cast iron cooking pan. Cheese gradually goes from cheesy to burnt. Sounds weird but it give the crust a nice carmelized taste. Loves it!!!",8,3,positive

Ambiance is ok, it's pretty tight inside. Service is usually enthusiastic and does a good job of handling the usual hustle and bustle.",4,0,negative
1796,"this is the deep dish place--excellent without being a soggy gooey mess. Also, since it is so filling, the price per head is very good. Second to none for deep dish and a pretty decent thin pizza too, a good bargain.",6,0,positive
1797,"I've gotten Pequod's a couple of times now, and I don't think that I'll be doing so again.  The first time I ordered pick-up while I was running errands, and was told it would be a 45-60 minute wait on the pizza.  That was fine, and when I showed up, my order was completely wrong.  I ordered a thin crust with peppers and mushrooms, and was given a deep-dish pizza with only mushrooms.  When I complained to the staff, I was told that it would take another 30+ minutes for them to get my correct order out to me (that time included being given ""priority"" so that my pizza would be out more quickly).  No attempt to make things right were offered as far as a discount off a future pizza or knocking the price down on the current one.The second time I was in the area with relatives from out of town, and happened to be in the area, so we stopped by to put our name on the list.  We intentionally went before the dinner rush (about 5:30PM) because I know how crowded it can get.  We were told 45-60 minutes for a table, which was fine.  Fast forward to 7:30PM and we were still waiting for a table and were pretty hangry at that point.  I would have been fine if we showed up and they told us that there was a two hour wait.  We would have simply went somewhere else, but every time we asked about the status of our table, we were told that one was opening up and would be the next to get seated.  We finally had to suggest to the hostess that we be seated around a high-top table (which for 6 people is a tight squeeze), and I never felt that anyone even cared about the poor service that was provided.  I really wanted to like this place, but it seems to me that they feel that they can treat customers however they want because if they lose one or two, they'll have more lining up sooner or later.",7,3,negative

1799,"I've heard that real Chicagoan's don't like deep dish. Whatever. This place was backed and decked to the walls with Blackhawks stuff. The best part of the meal, but also kind of the gripe about it, was our pizza. We ordered a spinach and tomato pie, but they told us it was a mushroom pie? (It wasn't--just spinach only, no tomato). Not sure how this all got bungled up but at the end of it a $27 medium pie was more than enough for the three of us for dinner. The pies take a while, especially since it was busy, but it is well worth the wait--just get a pitcher and put in an app order. When the crispy edged, gooey pizza finally arrived, we demolished it.",5,1,positive

1806,"So I really wanted to love Pequod's because my friend Susan RAVED about this place. Maybe it was the 1.5 mile walk from the El that deterred me, maybe it was the AWFUL first date going on at the table next to me, maybe my expectations were too high - but I just thought it was okay. Don't get me wrong, it was certainly above chain pizza crap and I did enjoy it, but it didn't knock me off my rocker. I had a personal pizza with nearly everything on it, and I think maybe that was the problem. I didn't get the entire essence of Pequod's because my sister doesn't like deep dish and I was stuck with a baby pizza. Don't worry I shook my fist vigorously at her when she told me this AFTER we walked 1.5 miles in the snow uphill both ways (I'm only slightly exaggerating)  to eat at this place. Either way, I'm willing to go back and try it again because I really want this place to be as groundbreaking as everyone says it is.",5,5,negative
1807,"After hearing awesome things about Pequods we had to come try it. Overall I was a bit disappointed. The toppings were great, but I'm just not a fan of how they do their crust. I know that's what makes them unique, I just didn't enjoy it as much as a traditional deep dish crust.",3,1,negative
1808,"A couple of servers at Alinea recommended this place, so I had high expectations. There's barely any cheese. The crust is about 7/8 of the pizza, the sausage wasn't fully cooked and it's burnt to a crisp. Possibly the worst pizza I've had in Chicago. I'd rather eat 10 pies from horrible Giordano's than one slice of this trash. Dominoes would be a massive improvement.",3,3,negative

1811,"The family was really excited to try Pequod's because we had heard so many incredibly good things.  Unfortunately they didn't live up to the hype.First of all the place was packed.  We wanted to do take out anyway so we asked how to place that order.  There is someone standing by the phone who just does the take out orders.  We wanted a sausage and mushroom pizza (with cheese obviously)  We asked if the sausage was sliced or crumbled.  The order lady didn't know, she had to ask.  Fine.  It was crumbled.  Just what we wanted.  We ordered the pizza and was told it would be an hour and fifteen minutes.  No problem, we had other things to do.Picked up our pizza and brought it home to enjoy.  Well almost.  The crust on the diameter was amazing.  I don't know how they get that caramelization  without burning the heck out of it and yet making it the best tasting crust ever!  The center portion of the crust was only just okay.  Also, not too excited about the fillings.  There really weren't much of any.  Don't know what happened but I didn't taste or see any cheese at all and the sausage and mushrooms were also a rare commodity though I did find a few pieces floating about.  I really wish that Pequod's had lived up to its reputation.  As my son said, about 20% of the pizza was great, unfortunately that left 80% below average.",9,3,negative

Both the appetizers and pizza was good, drinks were fairly good too. The staff is friendly but very slow service. The crust is definitely burnt, to the point where we thought they burnt it too much. With the idea of deep-dish and adding some veggies with burnt crust, it kinda felt as though it was too runny/oily so most folks didn't really like the pizza, but on the other hand, I thought it was good, except tasting burnt parts on occasion.",8,1,negative

The pizza was delicious.  Very flavorful and the crust was the best I'd ever had.  It was nice and crispy.  I have never had a caramelized crust pizza before and I must say, it was awesome. The price was fair and wasn't to pricey.  I would definitely recommend this place but do keep in mind, it's a long wait if you're there on weekend because we were there on a tuesday night and the line was super long already.  So glad we made reservations.

The crust at Pequod's reminds me of Jiffy Baking Mix biscuits you might have with some sausage gravy and hash browns.

1825,"I won't get into the debate of New York Pizza and Chicago-style Pizza, but I will say that Pequod's definitely exceeded my expectations. Everyone told me that this was better than Lou Malnati's, so I had to try it out when I was in town visiting some friends. Tables were very crowded, but we managed to come at just the right time.The bar scene was great, and we were definitely stuffed after ordering our own specialty pizzas. The crust is great and the amount of cheese to sauce is just right. Gotta love that stuff. Just wish it didn't take so long for to come out. I know it's common place for deep dish to take longer, just had to say it.One thing I love was the presence of Fat Tire. I know Fat Tire might be pretty commonplace in Chicago, but it's actually hard to come by in New York City. I definitely drank my share of Fat Tires while I was eating, which made the experience even better. I'll definitely be back, next time I'm in the area. Might need one more visit to push me over the edge and declare deep dish pizza as the better alternative to NYC pizza.",11,3,positive
1826,"Once you've gone Pequod, you'll never be able to go back to regular pizza. Seriously, I do not know how I am going to be able to order and eat pizza in Saint Louis again. I was in Chicago for business and meet up with two local Yelpers, Lupe d. and Damian P. for lunch. If it were not for their hospitality I would have never discovered Pequod's and true pizza.Side note: Meeting up with a fellow Yelper is easier then someone on those Internet dating sites. Yelpers post ""real and current"" pictures. Both Damian and I started out with a Pequot Salad (Half Size). What attracted me to this amazing salad, is that they use no Iceberg lettuce. I have a strong dislike for Iceberg and was thrilled that they use Romaine. They then garnish it a variety of fresh vegetable toppings, pepperoni, pepperoncini and cheese. If it were not for Lupe being a regular and alerting us to take note of the cheese. Damian and I both would missed the detail that the cheese is sliced in the shape of a whale. Another big bonus point is that they always serve the salad dressing on the side in a little cup. Besides the conversation and meeting fellow Yelpers from another city, the piece of resistance was the pizza itself.  Being a man from Saint Louis, I am use to thin crust and not a fan of ""deep dish pizza"".  However, when I saw the description how they make their pan pizza on the menu, I was sold. Pizza prepared in cast iron pans that have been blackened by decades of seasoning, is a winner. Then being told that the overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust had me saying, ""thank-you Jesus"". My personalized 7"" size pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage and jalapeño blew me away. I will tell you, Pequod's does not skimp on toppings, the tomato sauce is rich and the mozzarella cheese melted perfectly. The service was friendly. We had a main server who was there when we needed her and other team members assisted making sure our food was delivered to our table in a timely fashion. I have found my pizza heaven, I just wish it were closer to home.",14,2,positive

We followed this with a pepperoni pan pizza which is their version in the deep dish pizza.  We all enjoyed it but feel eve crust was soggy and impossible to pick up and eat causing us to have to use fork and knife.

Place isn't too big and is kind of dark like a pub. They said about an hour for the pizza so we ordered wings in the meantime. They were actually really good and I'm picky with wings. They were big and crispy and not too spicy or saucy. The pizza didn't really take an hour i don't think. Im not  huge sauce fan so I'm glad i tried this pizza rather than the 'traditional Chicago style deep dish' that has all the sauce on the top. It wasn't too heavy and doughy. Could've had a tad more cheese but the caramelized crust totally made up for it. The bill wasn't too bad for a medium pie, wings and two drinks, but we did only got one topping. Came to $40. Only thing that could've been better was the service. I mean our waitress was training someone and it  was busy so she was dealing with a lot. I just could've used a refill :)",7,2,positive
1840,"In my opinion, this is the go-to deep dish pizza place in Chicago. The cheese baked into the crust is what sets it apart, giving the pizza an extra little something. And surprisingly it's light enough that you can get three slices and not feel stuffed. Or maybe that's just me.",1,0,positive

I think the longest I've ever waited was fifteen minutes despite everyone always saying it's a long wait (lucky timing, mayhaps?). I got the sampler platter once which was ""meh"", but what you're really there for is the pizza, I imagine.I've had the pineapple and ham, the sausage and mushrooms (and I usually hate mushrooms) and a few other combinations and always have to force myself to stop eating so I don't puke from being so full.The wait staff kind of leaves you alone unless you look like you need something (in a good way, I'm never glancing around for the waiter in desperation for a refill or something equally insane).Personally I don't buy the ""crisped"" edge thing. It tastes burnt but hey, I eat the hell out of it. Everyone else likes that blackened crust (which they do on purpose, it's not a fluke or an excuse) thing but I could do without, personally.But, I know I'm getting it when I order and I keep going back so I've gotta be a little bit of a hypocrite because Pequod's is one of my go-to's.",5,6,positive
1845,"So Lou Malnati's is my spot for deep dish in the city but I was recently made aware that Pequod's was giving them a run for their money. On this latest adventure to Chicago I knew I had to give this spot a shot so as I landed at O'hare on a snowy Tuesday I placed an order for this pizza. I had a feeling the wait would be long and sure enough it was a 2 hour wait to get the pizza delivered. I made myself comfortable in the hotel and sure enough after the 2 hour wait, I received a ring to get the pizza. I had opted to go with the sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno deal. The pizza itself was massive and of course as soon as I held the box it felt like a million pounds. After a few bites into the pizza obviously the sauce was rich in flavor with the toppings adding tons of flavor making a great combination. They had the perfect sauce to topping ratio and man.... The CRUST be out of control. Yes the caramelized crust is really that good and worth the mention in itself. I was unable to finish the entire pizza but had to kill the crust of it all the way through. The sausage had a nice spice to it however my one item is that I like a bit more cheese to my pies... personal preference though. All this said leads to a solid deep dish pie but personally I still am partial to Lou's ""sheet of sausage"" and the way they pull their pies together. Still a solid joint and definitely worth a visit and my second favorite pizza joint in Chi Town.",16,1,positive
1846,"Meh. I'm not sure why people like Pequod's that much. I have friends who rave about it, but it's just not what I'm looking for in a Chicago deep-dish pizza. Pequod's has that sports bar feel that is great for grabbing a pitcher of beer and hanging out with friends. But if you're just going to eat pizza, the wait is ridiculously long and for pizza that's pretty bland if you compare with other Chicago favorites (regardless of how touristy or franchise they may be). When we first sat down, we were told a 30 min wait, which is totally reasonable. By the time we ordered, the wait got bumped up to 50 min, and this was around 2pm. They should really invest in more ovens or something, because even as a business, having people just sit for 50 min waiting for food means less turn around with your customers. Anyways, as we were waiting, we figured we might as well order some appetizers. We got a mixed platter with jalapeno poppers and fried mushrooms etc. They were over-fried. The pizza itself, when it finally came, was ¾ crust and barely any sauce or cheese or toppings. When I eat Chicago deep-dish, I expect to get a decent crust topped with a thick layer of sauce and cheese. They also put the topping on top of the cheese, which threw me off a bit. It was good if it was supposed to be cheesy bread or something, but it was lackluster as a deep dish pizza. The atmosphere might be a bit more laid back and a customer base of more college students or Chicagoans, but I'd still take Lou Malnati's or Giordano's.  I will give them this though, they have a pretty good lunch deal if you're not looking to share.",10,5,negative

You'll get to know your friend really really well.  The seats are kind of tight too, so hang your winter coats at the hallway coat hangers.  It'll save up the space for the very cozy booth seat for 4.Get the sausage pizza cause that's the best!  Their sausage is seasoned differently.  It's a little sweet, with a touch of anise.  And the crust of this pizza is the best!  The cheese is caramelized within the crust!  Unlike any other Chicago Pizza, the crust is thinner and chewier.  It's not too fluffy and not over dough-y.  The balance between crust, cheese, and filling is perfect!",15,2,positive
1850,"I've loved Pequod's ever since I was little and my mom would bring home a pizza after work from their suburban location.  Now that I live close to Lincoln Park I try to go here every once in a while.  I won't get into an argument about the best deep dish in Chicago but just know that no discussion is complete without someone mentioning Pequod's.The place gets crowded so last time I was strategic and arrived just as the Hawks game was finishing.  This was perfect as everyone was leaving and tables were opening up left and right.  We opted to sit at the bar.  We were told the pizza would take like 40 minutes so we ordered mozzarella sticks.  The pizza came out about 20 minutes later so I was pretty bummed we ordered an app, which I wouldn't have done had I known the pizza would be out soon.  I guess that's a good upselling technique on their part but I didn't have enough room for delicious pizza.  Tell your rumbling tummy to shut up (or hold it over with beer) and wait for the pizza.  They also have a really good salad, if you're into that kind of thing.",11,2,positive
1851,This was a recommend by one of our friends that used to live in Chicago and I'm glad she told us about it as we wouldn't have otherwise checked it out.  Best deep dish we had in Chicago hands down!  The caramelized crust alone should win awards.  We came early so there weren't many people when we arrived but there was a line when we left so get there early.I'd come back to Chicago just to have another pizza from here.,4,0,positive

1854,This is one of the best pizza places I've been to! The food is amazing and the service is pretty fast for a deep dish pizza place. I ordered the cheese fries and an Italian beef pizza. The fries were delicious pizza was surprisingly super great. This place is so underrated.,7,0,positive
1855,"Listen here, you must understand that this is a super busy and popular pizza joint that cooks deep dish pizzas (longer cook time) and you should proceed with caution and patience. This place is in no way a fine dining establishment so if you are looking for a wine list, a cloth napkin, and a server to be kissing your hand and feet as you enter, then this is not the place for you. This is a fun, busy, crowded and loud sports bar. The pan pizza is delicious, the apps are great, and there are a million TV's. It's so easy to see snotty and impatient customers around you not understanding why the pizza is taking so long? Or complaining about no wine list? Or that it's too loud, or too hot, or too crowded, or blah blah blah! Come on, take it as it is, have fun and enjoy the experience! Pequods will always have a place in my heart! Also, GO BLACKHAWKS!",11,7,positive
1856,"The fam and I tried this fine pizza establishment while visiting in April. The pizza crust was thick and flavorful with a cheesy crunch.

Our waitress was friendly and quick and we enjoyed our meal here.",5,1,positive

1860,"Oh Pequod's, you frustrate me so much....This is definitely my favorite deep dish pizza in chicago.  The sauce/cheese ratio is exactly what i'm looking for and the caramelized crust is incredible.  However, I have had a few experiences with bad service.  If you want to have the best experience here, get take out or sit at the bar.My last pequod's experience was ordering delivery:  I was told the delivery would take an hour and a half, which is standard for pequod's since their pizza takes a while to make.  After 2 hours, i tried to call to check on my delivery, no answer.  After another half hour, I gave up on the expectation of getting my pizza at all.  The next day i emailed them to request a refund to my credit card, which was done a few days later.  But no response to my email, no apology,  or anything at all.I am generally pretty patient: if I received a call the night of the delivery saying ""hey, something happened with our driver, we have to cancel your order""  then i would have been disappointed, but understanding.  What bothers me is the lack of communication, and wasting of my time.  If you can't handle deliveries, don't offer delivery.",6,5,negative

1862,Came in a bit after midnight right after the Cubbies took game 1 of the NLCS - surprised that we did not have a wait. We were immediately seated and placed our order shortly thereafter.

1864,"Yummy in my tummy! I have been coming here for take out for about a year now and I love it!  I usually order the same thing every time which is the deep dish pepperoni pizza with extra sauce! The sauce they use is rich, seasoned right and just plain delicious, so that's why I say extra sauce!!! The caramelized onion crust is what makes these pizza's perfect! The most recent visit was unforgettable! I ordered a pizza for pick up and I arrived early. So, I told the hostess I will be waiting in my car and I will come back in 10 minutes. As I was waiting she knocks on my car window to deliver me my pizza! Now that is worth 5 stars!! If you are looking for somewhere different for deep dish that isn't Lou or Gino east.. Come to the north side of Chicago and experience a different style of pizza with outstanding service.",9,0,positive

One of the FIVE... yes FIVE hostesses standing there told me it would be atleast another 45 minutes. They then went on to tell me that they don't take reservations. WHAT?!? They tried explaining that 'I was jumping the wait-list with my called-in reservation from the week before'. (which by the way, if this is a 'thing'- this arrangement was never brought to our attention over the phone and we thought we were making a NORMAL reservation)That night, we ate at Giordanos and it was wonderful.Pequod's has definitely lost me as a patron with their poor customer service, ridiculousness to reservations/no reservations, and for having 5 hostesses (go bus a table and help out your fellow servers!)",3,0,negative
1867,"We tried two deep dish places, Pequod's and Giordano's. We were a little disappointed by Giordano's, but Pequod's more than made up for it. They are totally two different pizzas. Giordano's is a layered pizza like a lasagna. Pequod's is like a traditional pizza with a thick crust. We tried the pepperoni and it was delicious! The caramelized crust is amazing.They also had an alcoholic root beer, which tasted exactly like root beer. The atmosphere was chill and didn't feel touristy like Giordano's. This is the Chicago deep dish to try.",5,2,positive
1868,"After a full day of drinking, walking, shopping, and doing touristy things, I was delirious by the time we arrived here for dinner so I can't accurately comment on anything prior to the food, but hey that's all that matters.From what I -do- remember, ambiance was nice (I felt cozy, and cozy is always a good thing for me), service was very friendly. The only poopoo was that our appetizer was forgotten until after our pizza came, but it was comp'd so I can't say shat. Will not beat a dead horse and rave about how DELICIOUSSS the pie was (burnt. crust. ohmygahd), except to say that pizza is forever ruined for me. Perhaps I'm biased because this is probably the only real pizza I've had, but for now I truly mean it. Would find any excuse to visit Chicago just so I can come back.",6,5,positive

1874,"The wait to even get the pizza was very ridiculous. It took 2 hours for pick up. I expected a lot more from their pizza since the wait was so long, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of really thick crusted pizza? So maybe I'm a little bias. But this pizza was just way too doughey for me. The flavor of the pizza was also okay. I've read a lot of reviews saying we should add extra sauce and extra cheese, but that was probably the worst decision to be made. Too much sauce and cheese and not enough meat. The ingredients were definitely fresh though. I give them that.",2,5,negative
1875,"I went to Pequod's for the first time about a month ago. The pizza was not for me but people love it. The cheese to bread ratio is very uneven. There is so much bread and it is kind of dry.

1878,"1970's Chicago deep dish pizza in a 1980's atmosphere.    I remember places like this when I was a child growing up in Chicago.   Pequod's is one of the only deep dish pizza joints remaining that I consider to be authentic.PROS:1.   Possibly the very best example of classic Chicago deep dish pizza, evoking memories of my childhood 40 years ago.2.   It's delicious!3.   The menu is everything you'd expect.   It's almost as if a committee got together and spent a year coming up with the most prototypical pizza joint menu.    CONS:1.  Success hasn't ruined this place, but it sure is crowded.    If you are a bigger group and plan ahead, you can sometimes get your name in for a big table.    But if there is just two of you, expect a very long wait, and to get stuck in a claustrophobic table if you are unlucky.  2.   The location is really only good if you live in the area, or are visiting nearby Webster Place.    Nothing convenient about Clybourn Avenue.   (The good pizza is worth it though!)Visit this place during an off-peak time, and take a cheese-filled trip back to the Chicago of the Richard J. Daley era.    If you grew up here, you may find a bit of yourself in this place.",8,4,positive
1879,"My party ordered a salad, cheese bread, large deep dish meat and small deep dish veggie. Also a pitcher of beer.I loved the sauce and meat, as well as the cheesy bread we got. The dipping sauce that came with the cheese bread was almost drinkable it was so good.However, the crust reminded me of Pizza Hut, thick and greasy. I had never had Chicago deep dish pizza but heard all the hype. Was not impressed. Our appetizer cheese bread came out after our pizzas which was already an hour wait. I was sat in this corner under a neon light that felt at least 10 degrees warmer than the rest of the restaurant. Also, our waitress never once offered to refill drinks nor get us a round of waters. The staff ""uniforms"" were confusing since everyone wears a different color shirt. It was tough to figure out who worked here. Overall, I'd eat it for delivery, but probably not come back in.",6,4,negative
1880,Just what you ever dreamed of for deep dish pizza. I had this delivered during my first try and was a bit disappointed but decided it was worth another shot. Have been to the restaurant twice now and am obsessed. I have ordered pepperoni and pepperoni/mushroom and both were phenomenal. A small is definitely big enough for two. Definitely call before OR order an appetizer because the pizzas take a bit to bake. Skip Lou's and Giordano's which is basically just a chain now and head to Pequods. You really won't be disappointed.,3,2,positive
1881,"Ok i read so many great things about this place, was gonna go to Berts but didnt want to travel the extra distance, considering he started Pequads I figured it would be close. Well this one going down in institutional longevity, which means they been around so long they sucked the locals into thinking they were good. Tasted like a flavorless piece of Italian bread with spaghetti sauce on it, and some burnt cheese on edge of crust. Disappointing. Lous kills you by miles.",3,1,negative
1882,"Had my daughter's first birthday party here the other week. We had 30 adults and 10 kids. Party was upstairs in the private room in back which has a number of booths. Reserving the space was easy, just did it online and also got an email from Sean. I had a ton of questions and he replied quickly. We decided to order off the menu. We ordered baked mostaccioli with marinara sauce, pitches of soda and 12 pizzas. Ordered both the thin and the pan. All different kinds of toppings. Food came out when we requested it, service was great. Janet was the main server and she was so nice and attentive. Everyone loved the food and it was a good time. For the amount of food we ordered and the number of guests, the cost wasn't bad at all and food really did taste great. Thin was crispy, pan was nice and cheesy and had a nice caramelized crust!It's nice that the room doesn't have an amount of time you can have it for. We set up at 11am, party started at 1230. Food was out like I requested at 1pm and the party was over around 3:30 and we got our stuff together and left by 4. The room has 2 tvs so the guys were able to watch games. I would have a party here again, too bad there wasn't more parking in the area, but it's the city!",11,3,positive

Yes.  Would I choose this pizza over another place? No.",2,1,negative
1885,"Definitely an upgrade from Giordanos which I've been told no self-respecting Chicagoan would find himself or herself eating at (whoops for me). It was still the 45 minute wait for food, but the pizza quality was definitely noticeably better. The staff and service were great and the happy hour seems like an awesome nice touch. I can't really comment on the pizza other than it was tasty and better than the last Chicago pizza joint I was at.Space can be tight so coming at off hours can definitely help get you a table faster.

1892,"This is my first review of Pequod's after two visits. This place is way up there in the Chicago deep dish hierarchy, and it is well deserved!First tip, this place gets really busy on the weekends. Time for a pizza can be 45-60 mins, even much later on in the evening. But it's worth it! The first time I went I got green pepper, sausage and pepperoni. It was delicious! The crust is really unique at Pequod's and the meat was SO good in this pizza. The second time I got just sausage, which I didn't like as well. I recommend getting multiple toppings, it just adds more flavor.This is a must visit place in Chicago. The pizza is outstanding and the building itself has a lot of character. I will definitely be going back again and again.",8,0,positive

1894,"Let me start of by saying pizza is not one of my favorite foods, but I do consider myself a pizza connoisseur. I back this up by saying that I grew up with a father that loved pizza. Loves pizza so much. We frequently traveled to new pizza places always trying what's new and highly rated. So, with that being said, I have a strong opinion of ""good pizza"" - I do believe there is bad pizza. Pequod's is the opposite of bad, it's one of the best. The ingredients are super fresh and I would go as far to say the best sausage I have ever had on a pizza. Besides, Burt's Pizza, who was the guy that opened Pequod's and then went to a smaller pizza location in the burbs until recently, when sadly he passed away. The pizza was delicious, yes it is doughy, if that isn't your style, you may not enjoy this. Mike, my boyfriend, wanted to make sure I mentioned how great the crust is, in his words ""it's top-notch"" (I don't eat crusts). My only complaint is the garlic bread. How can you have such delicious pizza and such below average garlic bread.  Will we be back, absolutely. Pequod's definitely hits the spot and fills your pizza craving.",13,4,positive

Waited an hour for a table.  Once we sat down and placed our order we knew it would be about another hour so we got their garlic cheesy bread,  it's worse than the frozen stuff from the grocery store. It was rock hard and was only made edible because of the sauce we got with it. When our pizza came it was obviously overdone. The bottom layer of crust was black.  Even if I peeled off the burnt parts it was still dry and lacked flavor. Just utterly disappointing after a 2 hour wait.",2,6,negative

1900,"Last week was my first time eating deep dish pizza. There were so many options of pizza in Chicago. After reading so many reviews on whether it was better to eat at the tourist chain restaurants or driving out to Pequod's, we decided to listen to the locals.  We went on a Monday night and even though they didn't seem too busy we still had to wait a while to be sat. Keep in mind your pizza will take an additional hour to make after you have put your order in. I was with a group of 5 and we ordered the mozzarella sticks and the garlic cheese bread. The mozzarella sticks were nothing specials but the garlic cheese bread was so good and got us even more excited about the pizza we ordered.  Our pizza definitely did not disappoint! We were so stuffed. We ordered two large pizzas and we were not able to finish one! We did not get a chance to visit Giordanos or Lou malnati's, so I can't compare the pizza to theirs but we were definitely happy with our experience at Pequod's.I did take a star off for service, our waiter was very snappy.

1907,"Hype. I really wanted to like it because people rave about it, but its just not good. First of all. This is not deep dish pizza. Its pan pizza. So if you're expecting a pizza like Lou's or Giordano's, go there, because this is not the deep dish you know and love. Pequod's pizza is more like a focaccia bread, very doughy, with a little bit of sauce and toppings and a hint of cheese. If you cut it in half it would probably make great sandwich bread. What toppings there are, are very fresh and of good quality.The best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese on the crust. Burnt cheese crust really shouldn't be the highlight of your deep dish pizza though. The wait is usually long and even if you place your order ahead of time, you'll likely be waiting anyway. Its like they're doing you a favor serving you bread with some sauce on it. Skip Pequod's and Burt's Place for that matter and go anywhere else for pizza.",11,0,negative

The pizza is definitely worth the wait. It is so thick and the dough has a sort of sweet flavor to it which is amazing. My only complaint is our server was beyond rude. We asked for clean plates after our appetizers and that really pissed her off. So much so I saw and heard her complaining about us to the bartender. She didn't ask how our food was during our meal but sure did perk up when it was time to drop the check. Other than her nasty attitude, the place is great.

Our nervous, yet very cool busboy, James, was fantastic! It was his first day on the job, but he even remembered my boyfriend's request for blue cheese when I had forgotten. The appetizers came at just the right time and temperature. Our beers were brought cold and filled to the brim. The pizza was perfect! Caramelized crust, melty cheesy goodness, filled with the right amount of pepperoni and spinach. Just the way I like it! Pequod's is hands down the best place to bring a newbie for some Chicago style pizza. The atmosphere is great for every kind of person. Not too sporty, not too hipster, and not too yuppie. I recommend to all!",18,3,positive
1913,"Use to always buy from here, it was one of our favorite places for pizza. Thank God it's not our only place we like to order from. Ordered our normal double pepperoni pizza, extra pizza sauce, extra cooked. Gave my name, exact address including my apartment number and then proceeded to wait for our pizza to be delivered. We waited and waited but our pizza never came. We finally fell asleep a little after 1:00 a.m. Woke up the next morning and had two missed calls from Peqoud's, one at 1:23am and another at 1:30am. I called in my order at 11:48pm. So I called Peqoud's again tonight to explain that we paid for our pizza but never even got a knock on the door, despite me giving them my apartment number(we have a door man to let them into the lobby by the way so no excuse for not coming to our apartment.) The nice lady who answered the phone explained the situation to the manager on duty tonight(Friday night on August 4, 2017) and informed me that the manager said they tried to call twice but I never picked up the phone so they are not responsible for us not receiving the product that we already paid for. I am a professional in the hospitality industry and I am appalled at the response by the management at Pequod's. You expect your customers to not only pay you for a product, but then do the extra work of chasing you down to make sure they receive it? I apologize Pequod's, but I was never taught that this was the way a hospitality establishment was to conduct itself while I was majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management at Purdue University. Maybe that's why we always rank in the top of the nation for our School of Hospitality and Tourism Management because we choose to educate our future industry leaders on proper etiquette in this industry. I don't want to insult another school by attempting to guess where you source your managers from, but they'd never make it past the first interview if it were my business. So, as happy as I would like to be to continue ordering from you, I will not be doing so for I have little tolerance for bad customer service. That includes not ordering from you for my employees when they work late as I have done the last two months.",9,5,negative
1914,"What a gem! I love the vibe in Pequods, the staff, & the food. Normally I am not a fan of their pizzas, but I do find that their pasta is AMAZING!! I love how this Chicago pizza place separates themselves from the others. It's definitely worth a stop!!",4,0,positive

1916,"Left feeling a little underwhelmed unfortunately.  I love both Giordano's and lou's for deep dish so I wanted to try the other deep dish place I kept hearing rave reviews about.  Firstly, our buzzer never went off for our table so once we finally realized that people who had come in after us were being seated, we politely approached the host who then seated us right away.  Not a big deal and not the workers' faults at all but not the best start.  Mozz sticks as an appetizer were good but the pizza was just slightly disappointing.  It was a little dry on the bottom and I kinda wish we had gotten extra cheese on it as the sauce to cheese ratio wasn't great.  I would come back, but I think I'll stick to some other deep dish staples.",5,3,negative
1917,"We had waited over an hour for seating our group of 7... they do not take resv, walk in only.  The pizza pies were incredible!! The only thing was they had recommended 3 pies for our party and we only finished 2.  Trust me ... we tried! It was very cheesy and tasty!!",2,1,positive
1918,"As a Chicagoan, I'm embarrassed to admit that I just had my very first Pequod's experience last weekend. I can't believe I've been missing out on this much goodness for this long! Pequod's is a jam-packed pizza place, and for good reason! Their pizza is the ooey-gooeyist of all the Chicago style pizzas. Their famous carmelized crust is just as good as everyone says it will be, and their tomato sauce is hearty and flavorful! If you come to this location in the City, be prepared to wait! They do not take reservations but do have a priority list, which cuts down the wait time. We came in on a Sunday evening and waited about 40 minutes for a table, and again about 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. While the atmosphere is definitely divey, and while the place is jam-packed, it's worth it to experience the greatest of the Chicago deep dish options.",6,0,positive
1919,I love pizza!! I went to this place about twice the first time I was very happy because we were able to get seated right away and the food didn't take too long to come out. The second time I came to this place there were less people and for some reason our food took forever to come out and they tried charging us for water. I'm never a person to really point things out like this but I found it very distrubing that we didn't get the best service that night. But other than that the pizza was great.,6,0,positive
1920,"This pizza is delicious. Gooey, cheesy, perfect. The tomato sauce is sweet and bright, and the crust is buttery beyond belief.

1929,"This place is full of millennials who are in the business of waiting tables not to service tables but who think they deserve a tip for whatever service they choose to give. We were told by a fat waitress who looked like she got to eat for free that slices would be ready in 15 minutes and whole pizzas took 45 minutes. So we ordered a slice and a sandwich.  A couple got seated next to us but after 20 minutes of no service decided to go to the restaurant across the street. Then the waitress decides to come by saying, ""Oh, you changed your mind?"" We had to question why the order was taking so long after 35 minutes. We constantly had to flag this woman down to get refills. Then she was quick to drop off the check and say its seems you are in a hurry here is your check.  Then a minute later is asking if we need change. Why can't wait staff get it in there heads that it is, I will be right back with your change NOT will you be needing change? When they ask that i say yes i will be and then give them a lower or no tip at all.  Oh and the food was overpriced, charging extra on top of the already overprice sandwich for cheese $1.35 a slice and .80 for sweet peppers on a meatball sandwich priced at $7.45. Food presentation wasn't bad but did not taste as good as it looked.",7,2,negative

1935,"Move over Lou Malnati's and Giordano's! This is the best pizza in Chicago, hands down. Technically it is considered ""pan pizza"", not deep dish, but that makes it all the more delicious! Imagine the Noble Roman's pan pizza you loved as a child, pumped up on steroids. That is Pequod's. I am really picky when it comes to cheese/sauce/crust ratio on my pizza and many places like Giordano's are very heavy on the cheese and don't put enough sauce on the pie. Pequod's has the perfect ratio with a perfect amount of sauce so you don't have to order extra. The sausage is packed full of delicious, fennel(ly?) flavor, but the real show stopper here is the crust. It's deliciously chewy and caramelized around the edges. The only downside to eating here is that the wait is often incredibly long, but it's definitely worth it.",10,1,positive
1936,"For my first ever visit to Chicago, I knew I had to try the deep dish pizza. As a NY native, I am a die hard fan of the thin crust. But when in Chicago...I had heard about the magnificence of Pequod's pies and came ready to eat (and wait). To our surprise, there were many seats available on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm! We got seated immediately and put in our order for a sausage pepperoni medium pie (6 slices for 3 people was more than enough).My first bite into the slice was the best. It was loaded with sauce & cheese and man, that deep bottom crust was so good. The only thing I wasn't blown away by was the caramelized outer crust that receives a lot of hype. I preferred eating the actual pie instead.I was impressed by myself that I was able to polish off 1.5 slices. Be careful trying to finish two; you may feel sick for a while. Otherwise, worth the visit and the future stomach aches!",8,5,positive
1937,"Got take out, so I can't speak for inside of the restaurant. I had a friend visiting and he was on a mission to try different kinds of deep dish pizza. This place did not disappoint. The crust was sort of odd, more like bread, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't recommend their deep dish. We kept it pretty simple with giardiniera and sausage in one, with pepperoni and basil in the other. Very tasty!",3,1,positive
1938,"If Pizza Snobs were celebrities I would be the Olsen Twins + the Kardashians.Pequod's is really, really good pizza.  I would also label it as a Chicago ""must try"" given its uniqueness.   For those new to Pequod's I think its important to point out:1) Their thick pizza is Pan, it is not Deep Dish.  Do not let anyone else tell you otherwise.  It is more of a Sicilian style thick crust pan.   2) The thin crust should be avoided.  It's not bad, it's just as good as others in the Chicago thin crust scene, and the crust is fairly thick and dull.  They don't apply the same burned cheese, mouth drooling, method that is used on the thick.3) The burnt cheese crust on the thick crust is awesome, and it just gives you that killer pizza ""I am going to devour you"" reaction aesthetically too.  Anyone who's had John's NYC will understand.4) Sausage and meat quality overall is fantastic.  Huge chunks, be prepared.",6,3,positive
1939,"If you're looking for authentic Chicago deep dish style pizza then look no more.  Being a guy with eyes bigger than his stomach I believed the medium wouldn't cut it, boy was I wrong! After eating two huge slices my stomach couldn't budge anymore. It was either throw up in the restroom to make room for more or just settle for a to go box. The vomiting choice would be a win/lose. You win more room in your stomach, yet you lose the delicious beauty that you just scarfed down. Looks like you're in a picks huh? I ended up taking half to go. I stayed at the Hyatt Regency, and the weird thing is they didn't have a microwave in the room. So I was forced to keep it inside the mini fridge and eat cold pizza when my digestive system passed through all the cheese and bread from the two slices before. One downfall is this cold pizza was not satisfying. There is just too much bread that it just hardens up and doesn't taste like a normal cold slice of pizza. Other than that, I was more than satisfied with this place and I'm sure you wonderful Yelpers will be too!",9,7,positive

That, and of the 3 Chicago style deep dish places I tried in my 3 day Chicago visit (yes, you read that correctly... I felt like a fatty for many moons after this visit).The service was kind of slow (it seemed like a busy night), but tvs with bad movies made up for it  :)",5,3,positive
1946,Probably one of my favorite pizzerias in Chicago.  Came here on a later afternoon on Sunday and got seated quickly (table for 2).  Ordered a draft bud light and the garlic cheesy bread to start.  The cheesy bread was delicious and toasty with a little burnt cheese on top with an amazing marinara dipping sauce.For the pizza (now we're talking) we ordered a small (shareable between 2) deep dish topped with mushrooms and sausage. It was delicious with the perfect amount of burnt crust on the edges (known for that buttery and cheesy crust).  I think next time I might just order the pizza with just extra mushrooms.,6,3,positive

And I had just come off one of those: ""last night - late night ....had to order what I could, what was open.. last ditch effort unspeakable thin crusts that actually arrived to brick cold and bleh."" Thats a review to come later - Save the better for first.I did take out and called ahead from the train - I had to do a quick stop and grab on our way to the airport or I couldn't squeeze it in. I walked like miles off the train for this pizza and I don't go far out of my way (which at the time it seems like I was walking forever) but it was WORTH IT, amazing and the people were rocking.1) I don't need to even comment first on the pizza - because let it speak for itself. I liked the atmosphere. Cute, on the corner - walked in - we were greeted right away with smiles and ""What can we help you with!"" Awesome! They were so gracious and kind - basically knew it was me! We were thirsty and they got us cups to go, accommodated us for our road walking journey with a speedy check out. I was so grateful. I wanted to stay!2) Pizza smelled so good in that box. Good price too although I just got myself a small thick crust cheese (basic) but it was piping hot and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Rich and saucy. I was in heaven. I couldn't eat it all and that says miles for an appetite like mine. I was fortunate enough to pass it off to someone in passing that probably needed it more than me and they got to share in Pequod's Yumminess too.Thanks for your ""drive by"" hospitality, delicious pizza, affordable pricing, cool venue and lifesaver when I needed my Chicago Style Pizza.

We just saw it was close to the movie theater nearby and it had some good reviews. We ordered a thin crust with pepperoni and ground beef. Pizza heaven on a platter I tell ya! Let me just say I came away impressed. Crust is a nice golden thin crust and not fake thin or soggy. Cheese and meat were fresh and quality. From the outside by all appearances it's very much a neighborhood dive bar/dining spot that one may not guess has excellent thin crust pizza. But this spot had waaaay better thin crust than many bigger chains or touristy stops I've been to that tout good pizza. If you're a big pizza fan you definitely have to try this place.

1954,"When you enter the store, there is a large sign that essentially says that reservations aren't really reservations, but bump you up to front of waitlist when you arrive (I'm paraphrasing).Unfortunately, they don't do a good job of communicating this prior to getting there.  My party as well as three others (including a bachelor party that was forced to find other food) experienced this.    We received a text message the morning of the ""reservation"" asking us to confirm the time and amount of people, but nowhere in that message did it convey the variable nature of the time.Normally, not a problem, but if you have a larger party on a tighter schedule (ie bachelor party, or family with small kids), then waiting until 9:30 for an 8:00 PM ""reservation"" is less than ideal.    Would suggest management improve the pre-reservation communication, both on the website as well as the text messages.In terms of the food, overall quality was decent.  For apps, we ordered the pizza bread, assorted appetizer platter, and pequod salad.  Filled you up, but nothing to write home about in terms of taste.We ordered a thin crust cheese for the kids.   As a native New Yorker, I found the crust a little soggy, and the cheese a little excessive.  Sauce was excellent though.  Kids liked it, so that's all that matters.We also ordered a pan pizza with spinach/garlic as well as green pepper/onion.  It had a nice caramelized crust (highly addictive).  The dough was thick with a generous layer of sauce.  The veggies needed some extra salt, but overall taste was pretty good.  One medium slice was enough to fill me up, and I have a fairly big appetite.In summary, the pizza was pretty good (order the pan pizza over anything else), but I wouldn't wait 90 minutes for it....",17,2,negative

For me, changing the alliance of deep dish establishments was one of them. I had heard about Pequod's from people at work, but I stuck to Pizzeria Due and Giordono's as my go-to places. Until I tried the glorious caramelized buttered crust of Pequod's that is...then it was game over! Is the wait horrible most time? Yes. Is it kind of a pricy option? Yeah. But is it worth it? Heck yes!  If you're dining in, the restaurant is small, poorly lit, has horrible parking, and no where to wait...but the bar next door is pretty chill.

1964,"We had eaten pizza at this restaurant twice. First time was excellent we thought it might be the best pizza ever. The second time at the restaurant was still pretty good. We had out of town company and even though it's expensive ordered Pequod's because we wanted our guest to try this delicious pizza. It was $60 not including the drivers tip for two large pizzas. One- one topping large and One- four topping large. We could have gotten two large pizza's elsewhere for  30-35 dollars less but we wanted the best so we paid the $60.I placed my order the day before. It arrived on time but it was barely warm. my husband met the guy and saw him take it out of the car and there were no bags around the box to keep it warm and for some reason sauce was smeared on the top of the bottom box. Their pizza is not good when it's not hot. We were very disappointed and not one of our guests said ""wow this pizza is good"". My husband and I agreed that we are done with Pequod's. I did call and tell the manager and he was nice enough. Said they have some problems to work out but unfortunately didn't offer a refund or anything just condolences. I think Pizza from almost anywhere else would have been better.  Also our receipt said 6:00 on it and we ordered it to arrive at 7:30 The manager said they set it up to start preparing it at 6:00. They tell you it takes 45 min to make their pizza but we have gotten it in 30 min. So my guess is they made it an hour early warmed it under a heat lamp (maybe) and didn't warm it in the car at all. It really tasted like it had been made the day before when I placed my order and was reheated and sent along. I don't think that's what they did but that is definitely the texture and taste it had. Although we will not return it is a good ( albeit pricey) pizza in house but don't waste your money on their take out. You can get a hot delicious pizza delivered to your home for a lot less money from somewhere else.",23,4,negative
1965,"I've come to conclude that I am not a fan of Chicago style deep dish pizzas. So my rating remains neutral with Pequod's only because it was better than Giordano's pizza, but still failed to really impress me. I can't seem to figure out if you are to order, at most, 2 toppings or as many as you want. Because whatever we ordered with all those toppings (photo provided), it was not physically possible to pick up a slice and eat it with 1 hand, let alone 2 hands! I'm a grab-a-slice-and-go type of gal, and I couldn't figure out how to eat this except with a fork and knife. Which is fine. I can be a lady when needed. ;) But, again, it's just too overwhelming for my taste buds. And while others around us were devouring a whole entire pizza, we, sadly, couldn't get past a few bites. Honestly, it just seems like I'm just eating of bunch of baked/roasted pizza toppings and not an actual slice of pizza. There doesn't seem to be a balance between the dough, cheese, and toppings. Sad to say, I guess Chicago style deep dish pizzas and I are not meant to be~~",4,2,negative

Even though about a dozen Chicagoans said it during my trip, I swear each one said it just a little different.I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars, as I think Pequod's deserves 3.5.  I'm rounding down and not up, because the other Chicago-style pizza place I tried during my Chicago foodie crawl (Lou Malnati's) was a solid 4 stars, and I think edged out Pequod's.After arriving into Chicago from Seattle at around 8pm on a Thursday night in mid-Sept, my foodie crawl weekend was just a subway ride and hotel refresh away!  My friend had already checked into our hotel earlier in the day and in short order, I was ready to get the party started too!  We had carefully crafted our itinerary knowing that we needed to hit up the late night places on Thursday night due to my late arrival.  After some small plates at Avec, our next stop was Pequod's and its late night hours (It was about 12:30am by the time we arrived).  Due to our jam-packed weekend of eatin', my friend and I shared a personal deep-dish pepperoni pizza only.  With a glass of red wine each.  The pizza took a while to come out (each one is made to order), but we were in no hurry-- after all, we were on vacation!!  It gave me some time to look around the small restaurant, (dive-bar chic was the ambiance) which totally reminded me of my college days.Once the pizza actually came out, it appeared to have a burnt crust.  We called over the waitress, who explained to us that it was the specialty of the house-- to put a layer of cheese along the outside of the crust, which burnt and caramelizes as it bakes.  Apparently some people would revolt if they stopped this practice!  For my friend and I, it was just a tad TOO burnt, so maybe we got one that didn't pass quality control... but I would say I wasn't a huge fan though the rest of the pizza was delicious.  For this reason L.M. was my favorite pizza place, though I can totally understand a late-night post-bar hankering for Pequod's-- in fact, in my early-to-mid 20s,  I could have seen myself being a fixture here!",7,1,negative
1970,"This location has a sports bar feel and a bit small for groups and all the business they get. We had soup, salad, and their pan pizza. I chose the chicken tortilla soup which had no tortilla whatsoever but had a nice spicy flavor. The salad and house Italian dressing were good. The pizza was really good, not doughy as other pan or deep dish, and the sausage was huge and tasty. I liked the crust but my friend didn't. Even though I didn't finish my portion I was so stuffed that I didn't have room for dessert. The two waitresses helping us we're very nice.My experience was more like a 3.5 stars. We waited little over an hour on a Saturday night. Parking can be an issue. Their menu is small and simple which is not necessarily a bad thing. However, I was disappointed they didn't have their own specialty pizzas and that you cannot order any food before your seated on weekend evenings. So I would probably try it again on a weekday.",6,2,negative

1973,"I've had Chicago pizza from many places and I feel like a pizza snob (Very high standards for pizza) in a way. I am not originally from Chicago (Kentucky originally) but lived there for many years and moved away. My favorite place was Petes on Western near Grace. My girlfriend, who is originally from New Hampshire, has never been to Chicago or had authentic Chicago pizza. Well, we decided to make a 7 hour trip from Kentucky to Chicago just for pizza. Absolutely no regrets at all. Service was great, food was fresh and hot, and staff was friendly and welcoming. I didn't expect anything else. Needless to say, we are fans of Pequod's and will be coming back. Next visit will be after we move. Such a great place and cannot express how happy we both will be moving back to Chicago. Thanks for a great night, Pequod's.",11,2,positive
1974,"Hmmm... where do I start?Basically if I ask you what your favorite deep dish pizza is and you give me a different answer other than PEQUODS, I'll either assume you've never tried Pequods and/or you're from out of town... or that you have bad taste. Loads of cheese and sauce and they don't skimp out on toppings. THAT CARMELIZED CRUUUUUST. Their wait times are anywhere from an hour to more. But can you blame them?? It's deep dish pizza made by the Pizza Gods. I always bring my out of town guests to eat Pequods and I've never heard them say anything like ""Hmmm, I've had better."" or ""It's just ok."" Their eyes light up as they take that first bite and tell me things like ""HOLY F*** THAT'S GOOD!"" or ""Don't talk to me for the next 30 minutes as I stuff my face with goodness."" (Now that I think about it, I really hope they're all being sincere.)I can't remember if I've ever had bad service there, but I think personally the pizza itself trumps and cancels out anything negative, so 5 stars!",6,3,positive

1976,"Came here on a weekend getaway and we were prepared for the long wait so that didn't bother us! We got the wings as an appetizer while waiting for the pizza and they were DELICIOUS I totally recommend them. Since there are plenty reviews on here I will tell you ONE THING. Follow the advice of fellow yelpers and keep it simple when ordering... They pack the toppings on so no need to go crazy! My boyfriend didn't believe me when I told him yelp said to keep it to a couple toppings, he got a supreme style, and he wanted my plain pepperoni (but I didn't want to share)!",2,2,positive

1978,"The pizza was great, very filling, and we were prepared for the wait based on tips here. Busy weekend night but we were given a booth & plenty of time - weren't rushed out the door. The only thing I found confusing is that the wait staff didn't have a set uniform - some were wearing black tshirts with the logo, others were wearing street clothes, and someone who seemed like a manager was wearing khakis. It made it seem like customers were rushing around, which I found confusing and distracting. The room got warm as the crowd grew.",4,3,positive
1979,"Pequods is my favorite pizza place in Chicago so much so that I always bring out of town guest here first because you can easily get Lou Malnati's or Giordanos but noting compares to the caramelized crust and indulgence that is Pequods.For people that are uninitiated to Chicago pizza, I always say that you must try a couple of places and compare it to other Pan/Deep Dish places. You will be unsatisfied if you compare Pequods to other pizza you've had because of the difference in the category. Also, be careful reading any reads on Yelp -- always see where they're from! Most people giving low reviews to Pequods are out of towners and have not had Pequods or any deep dish pizza place more than once. If you compare it on it's merit to other Pizza, you'll be disappointed because there is no proper comparison (apples to oranges, both are fruit, but quite different.)  The one thing that Pequods has over it's closely competitor is the amazing crust. It's caramelized and burnt looking but it's toppings are no joke. Equipped with a fork and knife, it's a difficult proposition to eat more than a couple of slices. Generally, a large can feed a group of five or more!My only advice is to actually request more sauce. On lazy days, the pizza may come out too dry and a dry pizza is no good. More sauce gives it more of a hearty tomato taste that really balances out the superior Pequods crust.  Otherwise, pick your favorite toppings (Note: pepperoncini is not pepperonis, don't learn the hard way). Overall, the place is good for groups EXCEPT on any game day which will inflate your wait for both the pizza and a table. I wouldn't necessarily suggest bringing a family here either especially with younger kids or older adults because it has a very bar-y feel to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's a great place for friends (esp. those visiting from out of town to convert to Chicago pizza believers).",10,3,positive

1982,"I'm not much of a deep dish pizza guy. Like Jon Stewart once said, I see it as more tomato soup in a bread bowl than an actual slice of pizza, but when in Rome (er, Chicago), why not indulge as the locals do?Pequod's was suggested by a friend who has awful tattoos, but a pretty solid taste in food and he didn't steer us wrong. A small deep dish was more than enough for two people and it was quite affordable as well (I believe it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $12). The best part were the burnt ends of the crust, and as someone who doesn't always end up eating the crust, this was a nice surprise at the end of the tomato saucy rainbow.The place itself is a bit of a dive and the perfect setting for a quick bite before a Cubs game. If I lived in town, chances are this would be my go to spot when craving a Chicago style pie (or ""a f**king casserole"" as Mr. Stewart calls it).",8,3,positive

1985,"I have been enjoying and recommending Pequod's Pizza ever since my first taste but my recent customer service experience set my opinion above and beyond what it was before (I apologize in advance, this will be detailed).My parents were visiting for dinner so I ordered a pizza for pick-up. When I arrived to get the order, the restaurant was swamped with at least 20 people waiting outside for their tables and even more waiting for their to go orders inside. A woman also picking up a pizza had an issue with her order but I didn't give it much thought until I brought my pizza home. After digging in, I realized there was a number of things wrong with the order and I sent a Facebook message to let the management know since something seemed to be happening in the kitchen causing orders to come out incorrect.I received a response that night offering to send a gift card, which wasn't at all necessary, but certainly appreciated. I received the gift card two days later and just went to enjoy a Friday night out for dinner. Upon arrival, we were told the wait was significant so they recommended we wait at a new bar two doors down where a receipt for our purchase there would give us a discount at Pequod's. The wait was much shorter than anticipated and we were able to place our order immediately once seated. The beer was exactly what we wanted on this steamy evening, the pizza was perfect and our Friday night was everything I wanted!Although the initial order was wrong when my parents were visiting, the customer service I received exceeded my expectations. The suggestion to wait at the bar next door, who's atmosphere was exactly what we wanted,  was everything we were looking for on a Friday night. I already was a loyal customer, but this experience was so much more than I ever expected that there's no doubt I'll go anywhere else for pizza, beer and Blackhawks games. Pequod's, thank you, for this experience. Businesses can take a note from you on how to ensure lifelong customers!",9,4,positive
1986,"Absolutely love this place. I'm a huge Lou Malnatis fan and this is my new favorite. Now let's be clear, Pequods is not deep dish. It's Pan. So everyone comparing it to deep dish is way off!

1988,"As much as I enjoy the Malnati's ""Chicago"" butter crusted  deep dish, the ""za"" at Pequod's is my favorite in Chicago. Thick cheesy deep dish pizza piled high with the toppings of your choice make this my favorite place for dine in pizza. The pizza is best eaten on site as it does not travel as well as Malnati's pizza likely secondary to the many vegetable toppings we had selected. We have eaten in several times and it was always excellent but took the same pizza to go and ate it thirty mins later and it had become fairly soggy so in other words it did not travel well. It frequently has a line/wait so be prepared especially on ball game days. In summary, if you want the best pizza and have the time to wait 15-45 mins to be seated then this is he place to go.",9,1,positive

1990,"This is our go to place for Chicago deep dish pizza. It is extremely hard to get into on the weekends. We have tried twice and been told an hour to an hour and half wait. Add in the wait to cook your pizza, and you're looking at 2-1/2 hour wait to get to fed. My advice if you intent on Pequods for a weekend night, don't go hungry! This last time we went on a Tuesday. A 10-15 minute wait was acceptable. We actually got seated in 5 minutes! Pizza was delicious as usual. Their sauce is great fresh, sweet tomatoes. The salad was disappointing. Lou Malanatis has better salads, they use romaine lettuce and their dressing is fresh, made in house. Our Cesar salad was made with leaf lettuce and the dressing was overly thick and salty. We ordered beer but unfortunately they were out of our preferred Allgash. Disappointing.",6,3,positive
1991,"As a Chicagoan, I love all pizza. Thin, thick, stuffed, pan, deep dish, bagel bites, pizza for breakfast, cold pizza straight from the fridge. Pequod's does live up to the hype. I wouldn't say it's the best pizza, mostly because I don't have a favorite. I love all sorts of pizza, remember? Don't come here starving to death because you will most likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for a table. And then after you order a pan pizza, you'll have to wait another 20+ minutes. And for that reason, we ordered mozzarella sticks so we could have something to munch on. Nothing amazing with the mozzarella sticks and, unfortunately, ours were only slightly warm, which means the cheese was not ooey gooey.. boo. Anyway, the pan pizza is HEAVY. I would say a small 10"" pan pizza is enough for two people if you don't want leftovers. In my opinion, the more toppings, the better! So we usually get pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom. Their pan crust reminds me almost of thick focaccia bread doused in butter and cheese and baked until a nice, crispy outer crust is formed. It's definitely a delicious pizza straight out of the oven, however, I don't recommend take out since the pan pizza can get a bit soggy.",11,4,positive
1992,"Best pizza in Chicago- it's as simple as that. Definitely expect a line, but definitely know that the wait will be well worth it in the end. If you're ordering delivery, it's gonna take a GRIP, but again- worth the wait.",3,0,positive
1993,"I was in Chicago last weekend and on Sunday night me and my buddy wanted to gorge on some good Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I had tasted deep dish before, and knew what to expect.My buddy and I were bar hopping, and every bartender we spoke to told us to visit Pequod's Pizzeria for the best experience. As we were in downtown, we had to Uber it to this location, and it was less than a ten minute ride. It was late on Sunday night, so luckily for us the place was not totally packed although they only had a few tables where we could seat ourselves. Since we are vegetarians and were only two people, we ordered the ten inch, and added veggies (onions, tomatoes etc) to the basic pizza. The waitress told us it would take about 30 minutes to get ready, and we knew that going in. We asked her if we could go next door to Drinking Bird for a quick cocktail (Our bartender friends had also recommended we visit this bar). To our surprise, our waitress had no issues with us leaving the place for 30 minutes, and she did not ask us for a card or pre payment. That was awesome!Upon our arrival, our pizza was at our table and it looked delicious. Needless to say, it tasted amazing and the crust was so chewy and did not crumble.I cannot vouch for the meat laden pizzas, but ours was top notch.Will make it a point to visit this joint when I am in Chicago next.",9,0,positive
1994,"Pequod's gets my vote for best Chicago deep dish.The cheese-to-sauce ratio is the golden ratio of pizza, and Pequod's is perfect. While some local deep dish places tend to go lighter on the sauce, Pequod's layers it on (but not excessively). Their sauce is full of seasonings and rich tomato flavor.As important is the crispy burnt cheese crust. Deep dish pizza tends to get a bit soggy, so the cheese crisped around the edges adds a nice crunch. And who doesn't love nearly-burnt cheese on their pizza?The individual (7"") size is enough to satisfy two moderate appetites, but if you're hungry, you can probably polish off one solo. And with inexpensive delivery and no delivery minimum, Pequod's makes it easy to do so.",12,1,positive
1995,"Hard to believe that I've been to Pequod's as much as I have and never bothered to write a review until now.  Let me start by saying I like this place so much that we held our rehearsal dinner here.  They have a back room upstairs that you can rent out that holds about 50 people, and I want to say they charged $40 per person for all you can eat and drink (including draft beer and I think house wine).  That would have been around May 2013, so not sure how pricing is now.I've had most if not all of the ""famous"" places around Chicago, and nothing will ever beat Pequod's for me.  I can't even tell you how many friends over the years I've turned on to this place.  Some are local and have since made it their staple place, and some are distant and now make this a priority stop when passing through Chicago.  I'll specifically never understand how anyone can like Lou Malnati's ""wheel of sausage"" pizza better than this.Regarding the pizza, the crust is amazing.  I know that it may not be ""traditional"" deep dish, but it's thick as hell and impossible to eat more than two slices, so it's deep dish to me.  When I eat the crust on most deep dish, it seems like I'm just eating a lot of cooked bread.  Pequod's caramelizes the crust, and most lovers would agree it's the highlight.  The sauce is also delicious, as well as the toppings.  My personal favorite pie is pepperoni, Canadian bacon, & giardiniera.  If you like spicy, the giardiniera is absolutely delicious (most of my non-Chicago friends don't even know that's a thing).Word to the wise, if you go at a time when most places are crowded, be prepared to wait a while to be seated, and to receive your food if you order deep dish (since it takes longer obviously).  This is Chicago after all, and any good restaurant is slammed when you'd expect it to be.  However, you can call ahead to make reservations, and last time I was there they accommodated a party of 14 for us on a Saturday night no problem, but I did call weeks in advance.  Also, a trick is that if you know what you want to order, you can place your order while you wait, so that once you are seated, your food comes out much faster than if they take your order at that point.Regarding the service, we've had some wait staff that was better/worse than others.  It's never been amazing and never been terrible, so we've never really thought much about it.  It's never gotten in the way of the goal, which is devouring as much of their pizza as possible before face planting.",15,6,positive
1996,"My sisters/friends and I came here on Friday, September 4th, the first stop of my Bachelorette weekend. Super excited, this places comes with great reviews.

Our table is ready and we are sat, our waitress (I wish more than life itself I could remember this girls name. She was blonde with a nose ring) comes to take our drink orders. She then returns and we are ready to order, we've got a few question on the appetizers. My sister asks her ""which one is better? The mushrooms or the zucchini?"" the girl (who is clearly annoyed at this point) says ""well they are all frozen and then fried."" Our mouths dropped open as she continues to tell us that every appetizer that has any kind of breading or fried part to it, isn't by any means fresh but frozen. As we are trying to come out of our WTF just happened confusion and pick a frozen app we'd like, she then snaps ""I have other tables being seated and they are staring at me and I have to serve them too"". We were all there for the first time, we had questions and part of her HER job is to answer and assist us and she really blew our mood. Of course as she realized she had messed up, she didn't return to our table for the rest of the night.

Uno's: Medium-density crust. Heavy on the cheese, medium on the sauce. Zesty sauce. Solid salads.4. Giordano's: The most well-rounded (potentially) of the deep dishes. Medium-density crust. Heavy on the cheese, light on the sauce. Sweet sauce. Great salads--would go light on the dressing.3. Lou Malnati's: High-density crust, probably the most densely infused with butter. Hard and crispy. Heavy on the cheese, medium on the sauce. Sweet sauce. Solid salads.2. Pequod's: Light-density, airy crust (as airy as deep dish goes haha). Added bonus (!) acclaimed halo of cheese surrounding the crust. Medium on the cheese, heavy on the sauce. Sweet, savory sauce. Average salads; definitely more options for greens at the other deep dish venues. 1. Gino's east: Medium-density FLAKY, buttery crust. Heavy on the cheese AND sauce. Sweet, zesty sauce. Awesome salads.Definitely love Pequod's, and it would totally be my fave if the Gino's combo didn't strike my fancy so fittingly. I think the attraction in Pequod's is that they dare to be different. Most deep dish places are just a variation on the theme. Pequod's really does have a distinct deep dish that dances to the beat of its own hip drum.",7,2,positive

2022,"""Give it 20 minutes.""""It will be out in 20 more minutes""We were given promises from our waitress that the pizzas would be out in twenty minutes, but as a period of twenty minutes passed, we got nothing but another 20-minute promise.

Our head of the party finally had enough and demanded to speak to the manager. When the manager came, he curtly asked, ""Okay, who is going to yell me?"" Fortunately, our head of the party was an assertive man and made that manager know that we were angry at the endless wait. The manager went to see the situation and informed us what we have long suspected: our order was forgotten. He apologized to us, demanded our waitress to fill our water cups and send out more appetizers, and promised twenty more minutes.An hour after speaking to the manager, the pan pizzas finally arrived. Admittedly, the pizza was delicious but it was too late at that point because it was not worth the three-hour ordeal.",8,1,negative

2025,I love Pequod's. It's one of the first stops on my taste of Chicago tour when I have friends or family visiting. They are always swamped so I make sure to go early or on weekdays to avoid the ensuing (yet justified) madness. I recommend to start with and order of wings before you move on the the sausage/pepperoni pan pizza. The leftovers from Pequod's are the best! The pan pizza holds up for delivery but just takes a bit of time to show up. Well worth the wait either way..,4,1,positive
2026,"My boyfriend and I made a pact: Go to Pequod's.  Eat pizza.  Get massive food coma.  Feel regret. Mission accomplished.  Being a native of SoCal and traveling to Chicago with my main squeeze, Chicago pan pizza was all we had in our minds. Where do I begin?  I immediately liked the dive-y vibe once I stepped through door.  We started off with their popular cheesy garlic bread, which was pretty flipping awesome.  I was surprised how well the bread held up with the cheese; the bread was still crunchy and paired oh-so-well with the melty, chewy cheesy.  It was a textural play in my mouth. Get it!The piece de resistance:  We ordered a LARGE (we were feeling adventurous) pan pizza with pepperoni and basil.  Dark.  Divey ambience. Friendly servers.  Expect a 40-50 min wait for pizza to cook. Prepare yourself for carb heaven.",8,4,positive
2027,I'm still thinking about the pizza from here even though I'm back in LA! I'm really glad my cousin took me here to show me what some REAL Chicago deep dish is all about. And man was I not ready for this. Deep is an understatement. Knife and fork caliber pizza because that's the only way to handle it. And don't forget pitchers of beer to go along with it. This place had a great locals atmosphere and vibe and it's no mistake that they are a total Blackhawks establishment all the way. Loud and wild bar like feel but still good for the family.

2029,"I love pizza and have been a Chicagoan all my life. Naturally, I was excited to try Pequod's pan pizza after hearing so much about it and reading the reviews. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. I had the pan pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. The overall flavor was BLAND. I found myself using the salt, pepper, and red pepper shakers more than at other restaurant I've visited. I agree that the caramelized cheese crust was good, but not worth the trip or the money I spent on the entire pizza. Additionally, the bread was too hard and flavorless. With all the great reviews, I'm left wondering if I missed something. Am I the only one with this experience? I don't understand all the accolades.",6,2,negative
2030,"I'm writing this in hopes that someone from ownership or upper managment sees it and can talk some sense into their management team......I ordered a large pizza for deliver and I ordered half pepperoni and half veggies (because of dietary restrictions) When the pizza arrived, there was only 2 slices that did not have meat on it. This was obviously an error on the pizza makers part, but mistakes happen. I called to see what we could do to fix the situation the manager over the phone was (and still is) a complete jackass! He said ""That just means some pepperonis laid to the side while in transit & we don't guarantee our half doers to actually be half""Really? That is the worst attitude and approach you could take to this situation. I work in the restaurant industry and have done so for the past 6 years. I have managed, served, bar backed, hosted, etc......I can't even wrap my head around how ownership can allow this manager to talk to his guests the way he did. I certainly understand that mistakes happen, but the way this was handled was absolutely terrible. Losing me as a customer, I'm sure will not effect your business at all, but if you keep up this attitude, I promise you sill start to see a significant decrease in sales. PLENTY of other delicious pizza available. Good riddanceUPDATE: Someone from management (Sean) reached out to me and offered his help in coming to a resolution.

2032,"I will agree with the other 2000 people in saying that the caramelized crust is delicious. Similar to a corner piece of a tasty homemade lasagna. Where I part with the group a little is the rest of the pizza. To me, every other component of the pizza was fairly average. Nothing was bad, but I didn't really love anything other than the caramelized crust. I found the pizza itself to be a little on the bready side. I know it's deep dish, but even by that standard I felt the bread kind of dominated the pizza. The sauce was a little watery for my personal tastes.  A little nitpicky, but I get to nitpick a little when I'm eating a $30 pizza. Not bad, but not the best either.",5,2,negative

2039,"My fellow New Yorkers know - Chicago deep-dish pizza ain't pizza. The dense vessel of bread augmented with a vertical growth of irrelevant toppings and something like an inch of cheese is more like pie, or bad lasagna... or some other obscene thing characterized by gross excessiveness rather than a relationship to that majestic food form we call pizza.That said, Pequod's serves up a damn delicious deep dish ""pizza"" (yes, you still need a fork to eat it).The difference between Pequod's and the other, very overrated Chicago deep-dish heavyweights is that Pequod's lines the cast-iron pan with cheese before baking the pizza. The result is a beautifully blackened edge of, yep, fried cheese - that holds the pizza together instead of becoming soggy after a minute and breaking off from the rest of the pie. The crust is also slightly thinner than the refined carb parties of Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, both of whom have totally mediocre deep-dish due to a dry monster crust of solid bread and an avalanche of cheese and too-sweet sauce that slides off the second you lift your slice out of the pan.Our medium ""pan pizza"" (as they call it) with jalapenos and mushrooms cost $20 and was ready for pickup in 30 minutes. The restaurant looks like a regular old Chicago bar: low-key, dirty worn wooden floors, maybe you'd see lots of daisy dukes if it had been warm enough. It was totally empty on a Wednesday at 10:30pm, though they're open conveniently til 2am. Call ahead to place an order even if eating in, since the pizza takes a half hour to cook either way.The first deep dish I've actually liked as food and not spectacle! Mmm.",14,9,positive

Pequods has been more of a disappointment than a blessing the last few visits, so a thumbs up to trying Bartoli's location vs just quality delivery.

Crust and sauce are all that really matter to me in regards to judging whether or not a pizza place is ""good"" (no one makes their own cheese and you can't tell the difference between melted mozzarella...if you think you can...you are wrong)...so since the crust is good and the sauce is okay, you get 3 stars.",8,5,negative

2063,"This is a review of my takeout experience. I was stopping through Chicago on my way home to NC. I decided to pick up a deep dish pizza as a birthday present to myself and went to Pequod's on a friend's recommendation. I had two hours which was just enough because traffic was terrible! I was very excited about the caramelized crust because in my experience, caramelized = delicious. I picked up my pizza which was finished on time. So far, so good. 3 hours later, I get to the airport and finally have some time to try a slice. The crust looks thickly blackened. I try it. It doesn't taste very good, it's extremely dry and very hard to chew through (I have great teeth).I call the restaurant to see if something went wrong. I ask to speak with the manager and cordially explain the whole situation. He was nice about it, maybe with a hint of condescension, and told me that it was supposed to be like that. I express skepticism, because I like all food (I am Chinese and we really do eat everything) and if there are rave reviews about the crust then something is probably not right. I ask if it could have something to do with the fact that I'm eating it hours later and he counters no way. He refused to concede at all and maintained as long as the bottom isn't burnt, then it means the crust couldn't be anything but perfect. Being that I was with my pizza and he wasn't, I'm not sure how he could guarantee that. He said, and I quote, ""Nothing went wrong in the kitchens today."" I'm not sure what that means in terms of my pizza. There were no kitchen fires? Anyway, I quickly became annoyed with his attitude as he seemed 100% unable to admit to the possibility that the pizza was not as it should have been. It's not like I would have been able to ask for a refund at that point...I just wanted some semblance of sympathy or offering of remorse!I did receive some unexpected consolation: a pastor waiting for the flight in the aisle across from me completely sympathized with me and gave me a nice pamphlet about Jesus. In his words, ""I thought there was something wrong with your crust the moment you opened it up.""I'm attaching a picture of my crust. The thickness of the black part averages about 4 millimeters. Two stars because my pizza was still warm after a couple hours! They wrap it in tinfoil for extra insulation and the box has extra latches so it couldn't open by itself accidentally. Very useful for a traveler.At home, I microwaved a slice that seemed like its crust actually had the right amount of blackness, maybe 1mm (unlike the majority of the pizza) and it was not bad at all. I wish the entire pizza had been like that!",21,14,negative

2067,"The pizza is still rockstar and continues to be.  Can't tell you how many tourists I've brought here over the years and they've been wow'ed.  The pan pizza is that effing awesome.  It is.  If Pequod's & Yelp sold marketing information about Yelpers to doctors, I'd be screwed.  I think the most times I've been to this location in one year would be over thirty for sure.  When entertaining guests that bitch and moan about a Chicago pie, if you must bring them here, the reacharound is to get a thin crust for them.  It's not bad, it's middle ground.  Personally I never order it.  Thin crust is also available by the slice.For all the naysayers that say ""what's the deal, why the long wait for blah blah blah"" Go to Pizza hut, there's no wait there.  For realz.Two awesome details about Pequod's.  They are open till 2 am six days a week and midnight on Sunday.  So there are plenty of times you can get in here and get a pie.  After the bars or a late night of happy hours, its a great way to end a good evening.  Second detail, their lunch special.  They've offered it forever.  Personal pan with one  topping and a soda or beer for $4.95.  That is a deal that cannot be beaten at any pizza joint, it's perfect.  At times when I'm dining with people with too many topping requests, I'll order an individual and I'll be content.  I think a Pequod's pie is best with minimal toppings, three max depending on what's ordered.Service wise.. it's not that it's hit or miss.  Just depends on the night.  I think the waitresses can be overworked because it gets hella busy.  There's the main floor and then there is also a second floor for much more seating.  I keep hearing about a beer garden but I've never seen it or forget to ask.  As a norm I always place my pizza order ahead of time.  It's almost ready to be served when I arrive and it's piping hot.I know once a few friends see this review I may get a text to join for some awesome Za over the weekend.  If you use a smart phone and ""check in"" to places, you can often see a popup mentioning other Yelp users being here as well.  At least in my experiences.",14,6,positive

2070,"I've never had legitimate Chicago deep dish until this past weekend. Also, I've never been to Lou Malnati's so I can't compare the two. I just know that Pequod's was really, REALLY good.We had reservations at 6:30pm. Their version of ""reservations"" is basically priority seating, you still have to wait a bit depending on how many people are there. I'd recommend waiting outside (if it's not too chilly) because it's quite crowded inside around dinner time and you can get bonked on the head or jabbed in the back with some pizza pans. Also while you're waiting, you can start looking at the menu and deciding what you want. You can even order before you sit down! Something I wish we had known..We sat down and ordered a pitcher of Goose Island 312. Great local beer, btw. The three of us also ordered cheesy garlic bread for starters. We were reluctant since we knew there would be a lot of carbs to be consumed with our deep dish, but went for it anyways. It was one of the best decisions ever.A common mistake that people make is forgetting this is deep dish. Usually it would be perfectly fine for 3 people to get a large 14"" NY style pizza, but since this was Chicago style, we downsized to a medium 10"" (sausage, mushroom, onion) and still struggled to finish. There were 6 slices and we all struggled finishing the last one. I think I left half of it on my plate and ended up picking at the toppings because I could not physically fit any more food in my stomach. I wanted to though. It was sooooo good, the crust and bottom were buttery and crispy, the middle was soft and doughy. There was just enough sauce and a good amount of toppings. I couldn't ask for a better first deep dish experience!",9,6,positive

2075,"The question I imagine everyone asks is 'How does the deep dish compare to the other establishments?'Really well, I'm not a deep dish connoisseur, but of the ones I've had, this one rates the best. For me it was the crust. It was still crispy and great with all the gooey cheese. Whenever we visit Chicago and are craving deep dish- we'll come here first :)",3,0,positive
2076,I wasn't impressed with the deep dish pizza. I ordered a small deep dish with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was too bready and dry from the lack of tomato sauce. It wasn't very cheesy either. The caramelized crust tasted burnt. It was edible but I wouldn't order it again.The cheesy Garlic bread I ordered as an appetizer was way better than the deep dish pizza.The wait for a table was about 30min on a Friday night for 2.,2,2,negative
2077,Not for me. The toppings were good but put on top of thick stale bread. The worst crust I have ever had. I honestly don't understand the line outside this place. And the burning thing? That just tastes like burnt cheese taffy. Lol Well to each his own. This pizza or pizza bread (stale) is not for me.,3,4,negative
2078,"Pequod's is THE BEST pizza in Chicago. Seriously close off your ears and yell very loudly at anyone who tells you differently, especially if it's your friend from Indiana who wants to go to Uno's or Lou's..... Get new friends.Pizza is like french fries, it's hard to have ""a bad pizza"" but Pequod's takes it to the next level. The toppings are premium (try their homemade Italian sausage), the sauce delish and oh my: the crust. It's doughy AND crispy. Mind blown.Sure, there are other excellent pizza places in Chicago, and you should try them all. And that folks is why Chicago is awesome.",3,2,positive
2079,"Worst delivery experience I have ever had! I would and will not be recommending this place to anyone. They are very unprofessional. I ordered a soup and salad combo. The delivery guy only brought the soup. Once I realized I quickly called the restaurant to let them know they had forgotten the salad. The phone girl was not helpful at all. She told us that if we wanted our salad it would be an additional hour wait to the hour that we had just waited for our food to be delivered. We asked her if there was anything she could do to speed up the process as this was not our fault, we paid our bill and tipped the delivery guy. She told us no and that we needed to wait an hour which tells us they hadn't even made the salad in the first place. I will never be eating here again. If I could give this place -1 stars I would! And I would not recommend this place to anyone as they are highly unprofessional in customer service.",2,1,negative

2081,"I'm not from Chicago. I've been here on 3 separate trips, however, and have tried deep dish at the ""best"" places in Chicago each time. Clearly, you have to grow up with this stuff to like it. It is not pizza. It must have been invented by someone who had never eaten or even seen a pizza, but just heard it described by someone who didn't provide much detail. This stuff is closer to lasagna, but not in a good way. Pequods is in a cool neighborhood and is a cool little bar/restaurant.  The people were nice here, though the service was slow and not very attentive.  I had to get up and get myself silverware and napkins. I found the pizza very bland, but the lunch special of 4 95 for a 7 inch pizza was a good deal and quite filling (even though I couldn't finish it) would I go back? Not for the pizza. I'd drink a beer here though.",8,2,negative
2082,"The pizza here was just alright in my opinion.  I got the personal pan w/ pepperoni, mushroom, and onions.  It took them like 40-45 min to make it and while it was made well, I expected a lot more from the sauce - it just tasted very average, not anything you would expect on a famous pizza in Chicago.  I was also taken aback that they didn't bother cutting my pizza - maybe because it was so small.  But I was about to stuff an entire 7 in in my mouth - I still needed it cut! So I just did itself - it didn't look pretty, but it got the job done.I prob would not come back here again just because the sauce is very, very mediocre.  And since there's plenty of other pizza places to go to, I would just try a different one.  But yea, this place is way overhyped from everything that I read.",4,1,negative
2083,"I haven't had Lou Manalti's, but I figured I would give this place a try first because it is harder to get to for me. Disclaimer: I don't usually like deep dish pizza, and if I had a choice, I would go for NY style any day.This deep dish was different than those I had before. There's actually very little tomato sauce and the toppings lie on top (compared to ones I've had before which were filled with a tomato sauce / topping mixture).What I really like is the caramelized cheese edges, so crispy! I also like that despite all the wet toppings on top, the bread on the bottom below the cheese remained completely dry! Not soggy at all! I think that's a huge feat to accomplish. For these two things alone, I give this place 4 stars. Also, the slices are huge! I shared a small pizza ( 4 slices) with one other person, and was pretty satisfied after just 1 slice. I continued to stuff my face, and ate another 1/2 of a slice. Yum!",9,0,positive

2085,"One of the best pizza places in the city for deep dish or pan pizza.

2086,"We opted for delivery and were severely disappointed. The deep dish consisted of 90% crust and very little cheese. To top it off, the crust was burned to a crisp. I love pizza, and am really not that picky when it comes down to it, but after picking off over half of the crust of my first slice, I didn't even bother going back for another. Needless to say, I wouldn't order from here again.",3,3,negative

2089,"As a New Yorker I have a very specific idea of pizza. However, whenever I want deep dish style of ""pizza"", I go to Chicago to find the best pie. I've had Giordanos and Ginos but I absolutely prefer the way the Pequod's cooks theirs. The crust is dark and caramelized and the whole pie is cooked so well. The sauce is tasty and the base crust is the right crunch. The service is great and the waiters are personable, despite being so busy.",5,1,positive

2091,"So far this is the best deepdish I had in town. Everyone talks about the baked cheese on the crust and there's a reason! The cheese on this was very generous, think giordanos, while the ingredients were fresh. What really caught me was the tomato sauce, they do it right. Good amount of tangy sweet. The place itself was dimly lit, and we couldn't find great seats, it was pretty crowded. But deep dish, after here, has become a new thing for me!",7,1,positive
2092,"I know tons of people say Pequod's has the best deep dish pizza, but I was really not impressed. I came for the lunch special, which is $6.95 for a personal deep dish and a pint of Budlight or something like that. It's a great deal, but I don't care much for beer... and I don't really like the burnt crust thing that Pequod's has going on. Plus, deep dish overall doesn't really appeal too much. Pequod's in general had so much dough and just not enough sauce. I needed more flavor going on in there. I'd pick Lou Malnati's deep dish over Pequod's.But hey, it's still a pretty good lunch deal!",9,0,negative
2093,"Best deep dish in Chicago, no doubt. My only complaint is that the pies can sometimes be a little inconsistent and on occasion the cheese-to-bread ratio gets out of whack. I generally solve that by always ordering extra cheese with my pepperoni pie. The pizza is better when you dine in, no question, but the delivery is still enjoyable as long as you don't let it sit. Reheat in the oven, not in the microwave, natch.",2,3,positive
2094,"Ok the deep dish here tastes pretty good I suppose when you get the RIGHT pizza. The service however left a lot to be desired, they tried to seat my boyfriend and I at a small table despite the plethora of open booths (that had a few couples in each). I asked if we could be seated at a booth as well (we had reservations and everything), my server was so annoyed. On top of that, the pizza we ordered was served to another party. The staff there didn't off any sort of compensation for the longer wait and they said the other people ordered pretty much the same pizza except it had garlic in it. So we decided to bite the bullet and have the garlic pizza, it turned out to be extremely garlic-y for my taste... we did NOT order pizza with garlic but the only other option was to wait another 30-40 minutes for our pizza to be made right. I wouldn't be in a hurry back to this place. It was disappointing to say the least. Who gives other people pizza and doesn't double check to make sure the order was correct? I was pissed watching others eat the pizza we ordered and even more angered that our server didn't even apologize or offer us a voucher in return.",7,2,negative

2097,"I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish pizza however this place seems to pull at my heart strings.  Keep in mind, this is not your normal deep dish.  The caramelized crust is awesome and we always go with the meatball topping.   The sauce tastes similar to homemade red sauce.  You should definitely give this a try.",1,0,positive
2098,The only way that I would go back is to see if it was as better than the first and if it was free. This was not as good as I hoped. It was disappointing as the crust was burnt which is the best part. It was low on said sauce so make sure you ask for extra sauce. I was told this is better than my favorite Lou Malnotti's and it wasn't even close. Decent taste but no way top 5 deep dish!,7,1,negative

2102,"Did not meet expectations. Sauce was bland, not nearly enough sausage, crust was burnt, and minimal taste. I don't really get the hype, but the fried mushrooms were very good. Probably will not be coming back, there are better options out there for Chicago style pizza.",3,3,negative
2103,"I am not sure what happened to this place. We used to always order from here Bc it was amazing. Being on a strict diet lately, I haven't ordered pizza in awhile. I decided to splurge and ordered a deep dish pepperoni. I can not even describe how awful it was. I have lived in this city 15 years and never had deep dish this bad. The dough tasted stale. It was so soggy that it was following apart. The pepperoni did not taste the same. The sauce tasted like a can of unseasoned tomato sauce. I could not even eat it. Had a half of piece. And of course the best part, as every reviewer complains about, was that I waited 1.5 hours for this dog food. I will absolutely never order from here again. Lou Malnatis is the best and pequods is not even near the same level as their deep dish. Save yourself the headache and order from Lous",4,6,negative
2104,"Was told it was a 15-20 minute wait for a table, and 55 minutes to get a pizza (deep dish or not). It was about 5 minutes for the table, and 20-25 minutes for the pizza. Salads and appetizers were good (garlic bread, jalapeno poppers). Large pizzas are huge. I like a lot of sauce and cheese but I have to say, there was more than I would put on my own. Made the crust which had a nice thinness a bit soggy. Sauce tasted good and toppings were fine. Overall service was good. Place to go back to, hopefully when it is a bit less busy and we can get a bit more comfortable table.",7,0,negative
2105,"Ordered pizza for delivery here in late November and it arrived lukewarm after about an hour. Cheese wasn't very melted and it seemed they had rushed out the order late as if it had been forgotten. We called to complain and they agreed to give us a discount on a future order, not to refund any portion of the order that was undercooked. We reluctantly ate what came because we couldn't wait another hour. Too bad, really, because this place has been a neighborhood favorite for years. But after this experience we won't be coming back. Too many other good pizza places around.",3,3,negative
2106,"I've given up. Been going to Pequods for a bit over a decade. When they're at their best, they are the best. Unfortunately, that rarely happens anymore. Even when they are on top of their game, expect to devote about half of your night waiting for it. Their service started to decline about 3-4 years ago. When I talk about Pequods with people now, a certain waitress always pops up. We call her ""waitress no response"". Here's one of my experiences with her (of many): Pizza arrives not correct, not the right toppings and hard as a brick from overcooking. She comes back to check on us and I explain how the pizza is inedible. She looks blankly at us, does a 180, and walks away. We had to track down the manager ourselves, who says the server is just too busy to deal with it (seriously!). Doesn't offer any sympathy, let alone comping, and gets annoyed when we ask for a new pizza.This was about 2 years ago and the quality of service has not improved. I gave them a chance (have still gone probably once a month on average since), but I have to move on. I have way more positive things to say about this place and their sporadically good pizza. Unfortunately, none of them are from he last 3-4 years.That brings me to quality of food. It used to be that we knew exactly what we would get when we ordered and it would be delicious. Lately, we've been lucky if it's edible. I had the manager tell me that being able to pick apart individual strands of non melted cheese was their style... When I told them I've been eating there for years and the pizza was obviously not cooked enough, I got an eye roll. I didn't even ask for a new pizza, just to finish cooking it!I'd much rather eat a decent enough deep dish, that doesn't take forever with terrible service, somewhere else. Open more chains or something, hire better staff and managers! I love you Pequods! Until you change though, I won't even go to use up a gift card..",15,4,negative

I thought the sauce was a little sweet for my taste and I felt there was something missing for me in the flavor department. The service was ok. Our assigned server rarely checked on us to see if we needed a refill or needed anything, but was there right away to clear our plates...even though some of us were still working on our plates. We were by the bar and the guy behind the bar was way more attentive to our table than our server.

2109,"As a first timer to Chicago, I had to try the deep dish pizza since it's one of the must have foods if you are a visitor to Chicago.  Deep dish means your crust will be extra thick.  I had it with mushrooms, you can add as many toppings as you want, at a price, I didn't want to overload my pizza and wanted something simple.  The cheese was good and the crust was very tasty.  You can get something small, it will suffice for two people.  I also had the soup of the day, which was tomato bisque, very flavorful.  The waiter explained everything to us and was helpful. The place is more like a sports bar with good food.",5,0,positive

The pizza is a mediocre interpretation of what Chicago style pan pizza should be.

The sausage was good but I don't know, it was just missing something. I can't figure out what it was.  I tried the deep dish and it just lacked. We got leftovers, which were accidently left in my car over night. When I got in the car the next morning I realized because my car smelled of garlic. I just threw the leftovers out, I wasn't going to eat it anyways.I'm sure I will be back, cause the girlfriend loves this place. But I would still rather go to Lou's or Gino's.

2116,"Came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed. Bf and I had been wanting to try this place out because we saw it on a list of all-time must-try pizzas and I read some great things about the famous caramelized cheese crust.They initially told us the wait for a table of two would be about 30 minutes, but our pager went off almost immediately after walking outside. No wait on a busy night was fine by me! We were led upstairs and seated before our waitress took our drink orders. Bf got his beer promptly but 10 minutes passed and I had still not received my water. Not being able to ignore my thirst, I had to flag down our waitress and ask the whereabouts of my water, to which she finally brought it out. Knowing that deep-dish pizzas typically take a while to make, we ordered the onion rings to start off with. They came out pleasantly quick and were really delicious. They were big, flavorful, and perfectly crunchy; like an extremely upgraded version of bk onion rings. My bf couldn't stop smiling at his satisfaction and said they were probably the best onion rings he's had. Our pizza, however, took excruciatingly long to come out. I expected to wait, but we must have waited probably an hour AFTER we finished the onion rings. What bothered me even more was seeing some tables that arrived and ordered after us get their pizzas before us. We ordered a medium pan pizza with mushroom, spinach, and pineapple and it looked and smelled amazing when it finally arrived at our table. While the pizza was flavorful and the cheese was wonderfully gooey, I was kinda disappointed at how doughy the pizza was. The thick dough in each bite made it seem as if it wasn't even a deep-dish. The caramelized cheese crust was good, but Pequod's didn't live up to the hype overall. So far I've tried three deep-dish pizza places in Chicago and Lou Malnati's is probably my favorite, followed by Pequod's, and then Giordano's.",17,7,negative
2117,"My favorite restaurant and pizza in Chicago - hands down. Way better than Giordano's and Lou Malnati's if you like a more unique flavor and recipe.

Would highly recommend getting garlic on your deep dish. Definitely go here!",4,2,positive

Hands down, the best environment to eat deep dish pizza in Chicago. You can be assured that there will be a wait of at least 45 minutes every time you come here, but it is totally worth it. The quality of ingredients and specialty crust puts Pequod's above the likes Lou's, Giordano's, & Gino's East. While the aforementioned are fine estabilshments that I also enjoy, I'd rather go to Pequod's anytime. They have a cool environment as well, with TV's everywhere and memorabilia adorning the walls. The location in the heart of Lincoln Park doesn't hurt. While Bourdain is partially correct that the only time Chicagoans eat deep dish is when visitors are in town, he's COMPLETELY FULL OF BOLOGNA when he says that deep dish sucks.

But by the time we had left the place was packed and there was a line of people waiting to get in. The location I went to had two levels decent size plenty of space not to crowded. I went with a their classic deep dish with sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms and garlic. I do have to say it does take a little bit of time for the pizza to come out, a tad bit longer than I had expected considering the place wasn't that busy when we had place our order. But when it came out it was looking lovely. I can not speak highly enough about this pizza. It wasn't a typical deep dish I was expecting it was almost a cross between a deep and a new york style. Super crispy crust and not too deep of a pizza. The crust is actually burnt cheese !! which tasted amazing. But yeah I loved how it wasn't that 8 inch deep deep dish I feel anyone not from Chicago would imagine. I was actually able to have more than one slice. The pizza was delicious and everything was cook perfectly. Definitely understand why so many people pointed me in this direction. Probably the best deep dish in Chicago.",13,1,positive

The marinara is balanced but not awe-inspiring (though how inspiring can marinara be?). I was pleased to see that our sausage was cut into thick, hearty slices.For me, though, Pequod's more than makes up for their lack of innovative flavors in that crispy, cheesy crust!",9,3,positive

In fact, I don't know if I'd ever go back... if I'm looking for stuffed or deep dish, which I never really am, I'd go elsewhere... Plus, the service was that of a Little Cesars.

2133,Best deep dish pizza in Chicago. I love the crust and how its slightly burnt. No other pizza is comparable any where. Expect long waits on weekends and game night. parking can be difficult too.,1,1,positive
2134,"Favorite pan/deep dish pizza place in Chicago (and I'm tried Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's). Crust is one of the most important parts of the pizza to me, and the caramelized crust here is the best! We order the pan pizza with peppers and tomatoes. The pizzas here are larger and less expensive than the other deep dish pizza places in Chicago. They also deliver to a wide radius and always arrive before they say they will arrive. We will be ordering our deep dish pizza here for every Chicago birthday! Pequod's Lincoln Park has been here since the 1970s. Very cool! Tip: We biked here, and there are poles outside to lock your bike to that are safe.",4,1,positive
2135,Definitely not the best chicago style pizza but it is tasty!  There's not really a crust/rest of the pizza separation so note that.,1,0,negative
2136,"To be honest, I was growing tired and bored with Deep dish pizza...but then I found Pequod's. This place blows Lou Malnati's and every other deep dish pizza I've eaten out of the water!!! I'm going to make this short and sweet cause I will be re-reviewing this place in the future...Pizza is thick, excellent sauce(perfect blend of flavor and some sweetness), excellent amount of cheese,  the sausage needs to be on each and every pizza, AND the crust is the BEST part (does not look the part but it is chewy heaven in your mouth). Great service and decent beer selection as well. GO here and grab some excellent pie for great prices.",11,2,positive
2137,"Fantastic pie! Had the deep dish with shrooms, green peppers, onions and meatball. It was awesome! I especially loved how the toppings are a top the sauce like a traditional thin is. Makes you really appreciate the toppings more than if they were in the middle with the cheese. and the caramelized crust is delish. It's like they put a thin rim of cheese around the cruse and burn it to a golden brown.Ambiance is nice and divey, server was cute and attentive and the bill wasn't too bad though a little pricey. (Dinner for 3 with 2 drinks each, tax and tip $83.)I'd definitely go back. Haven't had Uno's yet but overall this is the best pizza so far.",11,2,positive
2138,"Wow!  If you're like me and not a fan of traditional Chicago Deep Dish this is a variant you might want to try.  I personally see this as more of a pan style pizza than a deep dish due to the fluffier thicker crust.  Aside from the great sauce and structure of the pizza the biggest draw is the caramelized cheese ring around the perimeter of the pizza.  It has to be tasted to be understood.  At first your brain wants to think: ""Crap, you burned my f'n pizza!"" However it's by design.  Originally founded by Burt Katz of Gulivers and Burt's Place fame this place has to be tried.  Periods was sold by Burt many years ago but the pizza is still his design.  If you want a table get there at 5 or 5:30 or be prepared to wait over an hour especially on weekends.",3,2,positive
2139,"People outside Chicago have this idea that Chicagoans live on Lou Malnati's and Giordano's deep dish. I feel like it's my mission in life to let the world know, for one, real Chicagoans actually get thin crust at Giordano's, and two, if I'm getting anything thicker than that, is HAS to be Pequod's, in all the burnt cheesy crust glory there is to be had in this world. You want to eat real pizza in Chicago? This is where you go. Pequod's isn't shy with toppings, or sauce, and the cheesy crust is out of this world. Here's what you need to know about Pequods:-You will wait over an hour on Saturday night without a reservation; get reservations, or call ahead for takeout (unless you like waiting)-They have great lunch specials-Delivery zone is pretty wide-It's in Lincoln Park, but parking is pretty decent (no lot)-Goose Island on tapTaste it for yourself.",7,3,positive
2140,"I love pizza, so I was very excited to try a Chicago deep dish pizza. I googled where to go and I found this place . It wasn't very busy when I went in with my family . We got seated immediately ( even with a party of 10).   We started with an appetizer combo(9$) which went fast, which didn't feel worth it but we did have 10 people share it . Then we orders 2 large pizzas (17.99 each just cheese .almost 2 dollars per additional topping) . The wait was 30 mins which was understandable since it's a deep dish and takes long to cook.  So worth the wait! We didn't even finish the pizza( 2 slices left) because we were so full ! I loved the crust, I just wish it had more cheese. I already ordered extra cheese I just wanted more  Our server was very polite !She was awesome and was quick with everything, she always keep us updated with the pizza time ! One thing I found odd was that she wasn't in any sort of uniform, so she just looked like a regular guest  in a oversized sweater . Overall I really enjoyed my experience , it was my first time trying any Chicago style deep dish and look forward to comparing different places to find the best one for me",12,0,positive
2141,"Amazing deep dish. Compared to Lou Malnati's, the bread is definitely thicker, but the crust is so much more flavorful and enjoyable. Instead of basically a giant plate of sausage, you get your normal balls of sausage at Pequod's. Got two personal pizzas with sausage and extra marinara, which was the perfect amount for 2-3 people. We asked for less dough because we were afraid that the pizza would be too bready for us, and it ended up being the right choice. The marinara is phenomenal, the sausages delectable, and the crust is a glorious crown of crisp cheesiness. Definitely a place to stop by if you're visiting Chicago.",7,2,positive
2142,"For pizza amateurs and enthusiasts alike, I implore you to make the trip to Pequod's.  It's Chicago's best known secret located in the northwest suburbs.  Their breed of pizza is still of the deep dish variety, but different in way's that make this establishment my second/third favorite pizza in Chicago. (First being Lou Malnati's)For $21.40, I ordered a medium sized pizza (6 Slices), with pepperoni and sausage.  Out of the 7 pizza parlors I visited, this place takes the longest to make, but your patience will be well rewarded.What makes Pequod's special:1)  The first thing everyone notices about a Pequod's pizza is the crust. It appears to be overly burnt, but it's actually a thin layer of cheese that was baked onto the crust. While the resulting flavor is decent and slightly charred, the texture is phenomenol--the caramelized cheese gives the back of the pie a delightful chewiness that doesn't exist in any pizza2) Pequod's has the BEST toppings I ever had in my life.  The sausage is in meatball form but is so tender it almost crumbles before you bite into it.  As for the taste, it's dynamic.  Full of flavor and bursting with seasonings that'll leave you dazed.  Same can be said about their pepperoni.  There's also an added crispness to them that makes me believe they broil their meat before serving.As for the sauce, it's sweeter than most, but less chunky.  I felt it interplayed well with the salty, thick toppings.  The cheese is basic mozzarella and has sufficient ooey-gooey goodness for any cheese lover.  I actually feel the pizza tastes better as a whole once the cheese congeals to the toppings as there is a lot of ""cheese-sliding"" when it comes out hot.  In measurements of depth, it's a thick pizza with about a 1.3 inches deep.----Conclusion: Pequod's continues to receive local and national honors of being the best pizza. Although I can see the reason for the accolades, I still feel Lou Malnati's wins by a hair.  Reason being, Lou's characterizes, to me, what deep dish is about: A layering of delicious flavors that is so deep and so stuffed, it resembles lasagna.  Pequod's is made in the format of a traditional pizza, with unique differences in quality and crust.  Overall, it's a definite must-try during your trip and something all food/pizza lovers should indulge in. Extra Notes:-Accepts credit card-$4.95 Yelp Check-in Lunch special of a Cheese personal pizza-Adam Richman (Man VS Food) favorite pizza joint in America-Atmosphere leans more on the chill side and decor seems aged, but less touristy. - Wait times are long and it does get crowded-Servers are very friendly and suggestive-Significantly further from downtown, but take the OTA off madison&clinton and exit at Clybourn. Walk north for about 10 minutes until you get to Webster and turn right. An Uber will cost about $18-Restrooms are clean",23,4,positive
2143,"Given how hyped this place is as the best pizza in town, I was incredibly disappointed!  The crust was incredibly bland, and to me, that's a mood killer for deep dish.  There was some cheese burnt around the edges of it that was delicious, but 5% great doesn't make up for 95% boring.  Add in absurdly late delivery and I just can't justify giving it another try.",5,4,negative

I am always going to get my deep dish pizza here.",5,0,positive

My NY boyfriend is very picky with his pizza (and not usually a fan of deep dish) but we equally love it and always bring our visitors here. The wait (both to sit and for your pizza) can add up during peak hours so it's better to come before 6. Regardless it is worth the wait.

When we asked for new ones, the waitress protested that they're all like that. The hot wings were really good (hence 3 stars rather than 2). The pan pizza had such a small amount of cheese and sauce in proportion to the crust that I'd only return if I was craving focaccia rather than pizza. I think there are much better pizza places in Chicago.",5,2,negative
2156,Have had on numerous occasions.  Fantastic always.  The crust is quite possibly better than Lou Mals butter crust.  I go back and forth continuously.  One thing that puts this place ahead of Lous is the amount of toppings they put on.  It is ridiculous in a great way.  Order it well done.   Favorite thick/pan pizza in America.  Keep up the good work.,5,1,positive

2161,"Among my hometown Chicago friends, Pequod's is the #1 recommendation for deep dish BESIDES the chains (Lou's, Giordano's, etc.). And why? The crust. It's great. Unfortunately, I think they simply under-season their pizza. The rest of the pie ends up a little bit bland for my taste, especially given the slightly inflated price (relative to the chains mentioned above). That said, if you're going out for deep dish (versus ordering in/picking up), this is one of the best places to do that - the environment is comfortable and kitschy in only the right ways.",5,2,positive

It was plenty!!! We had 3 slices left over. I guess from what the waitress was explaining to me. This is not not considered deep dish but pan pizza.They don't take reservations. So if you have a large party or if if you don't want to wait to long call in and have your name put down the list. Once you arrive with all your part you'll get seat first before all the people who just should up with calling in first. It's weird, but it's not like a reservation where you'll get seated right away. We called in but still has to wait 1 hour to be seated. I don't know if I'd go back but it was delicious!!

However I could actually enjoy the pizza here as the sauce is not sour, and everything together makes it quite delicious.

This place was definitely worth the visit. It's not fancy, but who cares? It definitely has its own character, which is what we love in a local joint. The pizza is fantastic. You can choose thin crust or deep dish. We opted for the deep dish because, hey, we're in Chicago. They also advertise their crust as being carmelized due to the blackened dish they bake it in. The top edge of the crust turns black as well which makes it unique. If you are looking for a Chicago deep dish experience and have not tried Pequods yet, what are you waiting for??",7,0,positive
2169,"Pequod's is Chicago's best pizza. That's it. I've grown up in Chicago my entire life and have had the best thin, pan and deep dish all over the city. When it comes to pan pizza, Pequod's is the place. The crust is caramelized and crunchy, the pizza has just the right amount of cheese and sauce. A lot of places either put too much sauce or too much cheese, but the ratio is perfection here. The pepperoni gets a crisp on the edges, too. Even when the place was packed, the wait wasn't too long -- 30 minutes. There are so many seats here, with two bars and two floors of seating, you won't be waiting too long (at least from my experience).",5,0,positive

They have a full bar so you are able to keep the party going or get the party started! The best part is that no one tells you how to have your pizza party so you can pick the toppings!The restrooms are very clean which is super important and not to mention there is more than one!PS the pizza is amazing when reheated... And boy do we love having those leftovers.",11,2,positive
2171,"Pequod's is definitely not overrated.  The pan pizza is so good!  Two of us ordered a medium, and it was enough for us to each have 2 slices (and leave so stuffed) and then have another 2 slices to take home.I love that the crust is still crunchy on the bottom.  This is something that other pizzerias haven't mastered.  Giordano's has long been my favorite ""Chicago"" pizza, because I love cheese (and more cheese), but Pequod's has them beat.  I was appalled at the idea of burnt crust, but somehow it works.  Sorry Lou's, you've got major competition too!We also shared a half salad - the Pequod's salad.  The slices of provolone are shaped like little whales *squeal*!The beer menu is decent, but the pricing was a little more craft beer bar than local pizza place.  I had a Goose Island Green Line for $6.  You can request a table on their website - and it's foolish if you don't do this for a Saturday night.  My request was for 5:30, but because of the snow and traffic, we didn't get here until closer to 6:00 p.m.  When we arrived, I told the hostess about our reservation, but we were handed a pager and informed of a 10 minute wait.   We were seated at the worst possible table in the place.  During our entire meal, patrons were shoving by as they crowded in the ""waiting"" area, which is essentially maybe ten square feet of floor in front of the hostess stand.  I got elbowed in the back a few times, sometimes it was inevitable and some people apologized.  Others didn't and were too consumed with grouching about their wait.  Even the servers had trouble getting through the crowd!  If you can, get a seat as far away from the door as possible.  I'm happy that even though we were late, we got a seat quickly, but the layout sucks and Pequod's is best avoided during peak times unless you're placing a carryout order.The mascot still has me confused.  I don't know what a whale with...is that a thong on it's face?...has to do with pizza.",10,8,positive

The best part was the crisp cheese on the crust!

From the caramelized crust, to the ooey gooey cheesiness, to the little morsels of pineapple paired with canadian bacon - did ya forget I'm a Hawaiian pizza freak? - I've never been disappointed and I will always pick Pequod's as my fave when anyone inquires. In 4+ year love affair with  Pequod's, I'd never been to this location, but on my last trip to Chicago this was the most convenient, so off we went.

If you're ordering takeout, expect to sit there for 10 minutes twiddling your thumbs even if your pizza is ready. They have really bad communication between the counter and kitchen. Once their power was out during a storm and I remember thinking; ""Oh boy if they can't get it together during normal conditions this'll be a challenge."" I probably waited 45 minutes or so only to be told they lost my order.

2186,"Pequod's was good but for me not really worthy of the hype and I think that came down to the crust. The crust was so large but so soft. There was no way you could pick up a piece and eat it and I feel like it's not pizza if you can't pick it up with your hands and eat it. But also, I felt like with all the overly fluffy crust, I got shortchanged on cheese. On the plus side there were plenty of the toppings and the right amount of sauce. It made for a good pizza, but not the so highly coveted best-deep-dish-in-Chicago.For me, all deep dish pizzas just end up compared to each other and the two most popular are Giordanos and Lou Malnatis. I prefer Giordanos; Lou Malnatis overdoes the sauce for me, Pequods is similar but instead of overdoing the sauce they overdo the crust, and for me Giordanos just does everything right. Would I go back? Yea, if others pushed for it, but I'd rather other deep dish (whether Giordanos or other local places)",10,1,negative
2187,"Pequod's was an unexpectedly fantastic deep dish.  Unexpected because I'd never heard of it, and it may be the best deep dish I've ever had!I had a deep dish with pepperoni, pineapple, and extra sauce which would not normally be my first choice, but was absolutely delicious.  I'm told it can be slightly dry on sauce without the extra order, so give that a shot if you feel like something is missing.  The cheesy burnt crust was also an amazing surprise as I don't normally like burnt anything, especially cheese but it too was fantastic!Next time I go back I'm going to have to try  Italian Beef and Jalapeno or Hot Giardiniera!I'll keep the review simple since I had delivery - order it, chow it, sleep it off, repeat.",7,2,positive
2188,Awesome deep dish pizza and great service! Definitely coming back here again! This is nos my favorite deep dish pizza now.,2,0,positive
2189,"Ate here for the 2nd time a few days ago!! Best deep dish I had so far- beats Giordanos any day. The pizza comes out super hot. The cheese is absolutely amazing, so creamy, melts right off the pizza. I only tried the deep dish pizza pie and it's to die for!The reason for the 4 stars, however, as follows:They get pretty busy so service can be a little slow. First time our waitress was still great, despite how busy it was. The second time we came here we felt a little ignored and forgotten. Also, if you like a lot of toppings, can come out pretty expensive. They charge about 3 extra dollars PER topping. I love my toppings, so our pizza pie went from $18 to about $46!!! Nevertheless, totally worth it! Will come here whenever I absolutely need a, to die for, Chicago style deep dish. Worth the 1 hr drive here for me!",10,4,positive
2190,"Best deep dish ""Chicago style"" pizza in the world. Friendly staff, service is good, pizza takes 45min+ to cook, so make sure you have time. Really well priced bc You only need 1 slice, maybe 2 if your a heavy eater. Highly recommend!!",3,0,positive
2191,"Incredible pizza. The crust is a thing of beauty, like fresh baked bread but caramelized and seamlessly integrated into the rest of the pizza. The wait times and limited space in the restaurant are the only drawbacks.",4,1,positive

2194,"Right off the plane and first on my list was pequods! This place seems busy but the wait isn't too bad. There is street parking a little further away, so you'll have to do a little walking. I had the lunch special, one personal cheese deep dish pizza and salad. Plus a side order of buffalo wings. The buffalo wings came out first and it was great, small crispy wings. The pizza didn't come out til 30 mins later. I wasn't t aware it would take so long until I over heard the waitress at the table next to us saying it takes 30 mins to cook. It was totally worth the wait tho. That crispy edge with over flowing cheese was soooo good. I'd fly back just for this! I didn't try any other deep dish pizzas in town because the pictures and reviews for other restaurants just didn't compare.",3,1,positive
2195,"Yummy, yummy, yummy I got Pequods in my belly.  Everyone is totally jelly.Caramelized cheese crust is a must!  I eat it til I bust!Toppings galore...nothing here is a bore.Had takeout, so I don't know what the restaurant is about!",1,1,positive
2196,"Never eating here again due to poor customer service and a ridiculous wait. I had relatives in town and I called ahead to put my name on the ""list"" since they don't accept reservations. When we arrived, they said it was a 60 minute wait. Went up to the hostess at that time and they said it'd be another 45 minute wait. So we waited because at that point, we had already invested a lot of time. Went back to the hostess and there still wasn't any seating, and on top of that the pizza would take another 30 minutes to make even after we got seated, so we left. The pizza isn't worth the hassle, I'd choose giordanos over pequods any day.",2,2,negative
2197,"I've been a loyal fan of Lou's deep dish my whole life... Until I tried this place.  Holy crap.  AMAZING. It was super crowded and we waited almost an hour for our table, but it was well worth it.The burnt cheesie crust is like nothing I've ever tasted before.  I never thought pizza could be a life changing experience, but here we are.",5,2,positive
2198,"Horrible, if you want a piece of bread with a millimeter of cheese on top then this is your place!  When you open the pizza it looks great but don't be deceived.. Been a customer for a decade and it's a shame to write this! GDD",2,1,negative

2200,I've heard a lot of hype about this place and finally got around to checking it out since I was in the area. Can't say I was pleased. I ordered a medium deep dish with jalapeños and onions and easy cheese. First thing I notice was the bread/dough was really really dry. It was fluffy but had lost literally all of its moisture. Plus they kinda started to burn the bottom. As I pushed through the second slice I noticed the sauce wasn't that sweet and was heavy in some spice/seasoning that that began to make it overwhelming and I barely finished. I started to feel sick because of this and all of the water I had to drink to counter the dry bread. Best thing I could say was the jalapeños were spicy. Service was okay but since we didn't order much we rarely saw the waitress. But it was also busy so that could be why.Can't say I'll recommend this place. Lou Malnati's in my opinion still has the best deep dish pizza in the city. Hell the frozen Roundry's pizza I got from Mariano's was better. But that's just my two cents and I'm sure others will totally disagree with me. I just can't say I'd understand their point of view.,6,5,negative
2201,"Go right now! Seriously, stop whatever you're doing and head to be Pequod's.This might just be the best pizza I've ever had in my whole life! I didn't get to eat at Lou's this time so I'm not sure I can compare. The ratio of sauce to crust to toppings is perfect, I'm not sure what people are complaining about on here. If you love deep dish pizza, then this is perfect for you.The pepperoni on top is razor thin so the pieces on the top were almost like a chip they were crunchy. I picked them all off and still have plenty of pepperoni that were soft left behind. There was an ample amount of toppings as I got pepperoni and pineapple on top of the $4.95 cheese special they have at lunch. Which by the way, also includes a beverage. Such a deal! You pay $.80 extra for each additional toppings.I also spend the extra $2.50 on a salad, just because I eaten total junk food this week and thought that might be good for me. The salad was tiny but good. They make their own ranch and Italian.It's so hard to explain the crust that people are talking about on here, the cheese on the outside is amazing, it doesn't taste burnt at all, it's just crispy goodness.  Each of the pizzas is cooked in its own cast-iron skillet.The sauce is perfect. It's a great complement to the crust and the toppings, unlike some other places in Chicago, it doesn't overrule the entire pie.Really, I think if I lived in Chicago, I would have to get a job at this place as the person that eats the crust that anybody leaves behind when they're finished. I guess I'll have to pay them too. I doubt they'll pay me. But really, it's that good!!!!!",19,3,positive
2202,"I mean I don't know what else I can really add to the accolades that have been heaped upon Pequod's for years.  I first visited in 2008 and it was instant love.  Since then I've ordered delivery off and on over the years.  It was my recent move out of their delivery zone (literally just a couple blocks, c'mon guys!!!! Hook a brother up) that finally forced me back to the brick and mortar.  Dear god, I'm an idiot.  It's so much better in the shop than delivery.  The perfect crunchiness on the bottom of the crust for the pan pizza simply can't be maintained the same when you have it delivered.  I love this place, it is consistently the best pizza in Chicago.",7,1,positive
2203,My favorite pizza in Chicago. Super crowded and loud but worth it!,2,1,positive
2204,"I've been coming to Pequod's chicago for over 10 years now and hands down, Pequods has the best pizza in Chicago!!!! I'm not one for pan pizza or deep dish (as i tend to enjoy thin crust more....) but this place absolutely does pizza right.  The carmelized cheese crust is what makes this pizza the best.  Best times to go are during the weekdays (if you can get the time off!).  Parking is a bit difficult on the street but worth the drive up to Chicago.  They have a second location in the North suburbs if you live near morton grove.  Both places are great and worth your time if you want great pizza at inexpensive prices.",9,1,positive

2206,"Pequod's pizza is my husband's favorite deep dish in the city and of course I had to check it out! I went on a Wednesday night and two people on a date can get seated in 20 minutes or less! The restaurant is actually larger than it appears on the outside and they have lots of tables and booths for groups or just couples. What I did not realize was the pizza crust is burnt, which is apparently their thing. It doesn't have a burnt taste, but it is flavorful and the sauce is more runny than chunky tomato. Pequod's definitely has more of a unique neighborhood-local vibe that you don't find with most other deep dishes places in Chicago which seem more chain-y. I found the pizza to be a little greasier than expected with a deep dish and expect another 20 minute wait time for the deep dish. We ordered a large between the two of us and only at 1-2 slices. Large is LARGE and filling at Pequod's. I ended up feeling sick after eating it tho but that may have just been my own fault. I gave this a four star because of the grease and the small drink list.",1,3,positive
2207,"Love it, so different than the typical deep dish which I love as well. Great taste you won't get anywhere else!",2,0,positive
2208,"was recommended by a close friend visiting Chicago who simultaneously called me out for not knowing of this place as I am a Chicago-native. Walking in you are immediately greeting by the overwhelming (but appropriate and so appreciated) Chicago spirit. downstairs is a bar with several flat screens and upstairs is additional seating.I ordered the mozzarella sticks which def hit my appetizer expectations but were otherwise standard. It was cool that you could make a personalized pizza with whatever toppings you desired, so I ordered a mushroom, sausage, and spinach personal Pan pizza. the crust was cooked in their special advertised way which I felt was interesting but that's where the Pizza stopped impressing me. Growing up in Chicago and now living in New York, I refrain from using a fork and knife when eating my pizza out of respect for how my parents raised me. My pizza unfortunately fell apart and this wasn't possible. While the toppings were good, the Marinara sauce was really bland.Overall interesting place but fell short of my Chicago pizza expectations",9,3,negative
2209,Of course you had to get deep dish in Chicago. My friend has tried all the popular ones but all her local friends say that this is the best one. Unfortunately this is not really close to downtown so you have to uber it there. It says that it closes at midnight but I think it was open and there was a sign that said til 1-1:30am. So we had a 11pm dinner and it takes about 30-45 minutes to make it. You get to make your own so we got two deep dish: One large with sausage and pepperoni and the other with mushroom and spinach split along 6 people. I thought it was pretty good and quite filling. Now I am not a deep dish type of girl because I want to taste all the ingredients instead of a pile of tomato sauce. Two larges was a lot for a group of six since the crust is so damn thick and filling so maybe a large and medium for a group like ours. I cant tell if it is better or not than the next since they sorta taste the same.,6,2,positive
2210,"Being new to Chicago, I was told prior to my move that Giordano's was the place to go for deep dish. Working at a Two Michelin Star Restaurant molecular cooks said that Pequod's is the place to go for a good pizza. It certainly is, the flavors accent one another in a way that is extraordinary. The caramelized crust makes it unlike anything else you'll find in Chicago. Definitely making the trip to Lincoln Park whenever I'm in the mood for pizza.",2,0,positive
2211,"First time there and will never be back!!!  Waited nearly 2 hours to be seated and another hour forty five for a cheese and sausage pizza, which by the way was nothing  special at all!!!!!  A party of 8 which ordered nearly twenty minutes after us had their pizzas and were leaving before we even got ours.  Our waitress Kaylee and the manager had nothing but excuses rather than a simple apology.  The place was dark and dirty.  If you want a really good pizza, try Palermo's 95th or Gino's on Superior.  I'll be sure to spread the word to everyone I know.  By the way, this place doesn't even deserve one star!!!!",1,3,negative
2212,"Landed in Chicago and this was the first stop I made at 11PM on a Friday night. There were three of us and we were seated promptly without a reservation. It was quite packed however, and we were brought upstairs for additional seating. Definitely a divey vibe with the dim lighting and neon signs. We went ahead and just ordered a medium pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. This is probably just common sense but don't come hungry because obviously deep dish will take a while to bake and we were dying of hunger waiting for that pie to come out. When it finally arrived at our table, it was glorious. The cheese, the sauce, the MEAT (sausage was so good!!) , the crust all came together to become a symphonic meal. I'm a deep dish noob, so I was taken aback by just how monstrous it was. I was barely able to finish my two slices of pizza, which is pretty shameful for me. Basically, the first piece was heaven, the second piece was a little less enjoyable because I was already strangely full and the crust wasn't as crispy. I was also surprised by the sauce to dough ratio because I had this preconception that Chicago deep dish would be very saucey. I was wrong. Not too mad about it because it clearly works for this pie. I probably wouldn't frequent this place if I lived in Chicago, but I'm very glad I got to try it while I was there!",9,5,positive
2213,"Pizza is okay, but I would never dine in here again. We ordered takeout because of the line, and when it arrived they said we could eat at the bar.As soon as we sat down, the bartender decided that because we came from takeout we weren't going to order anything and weren't worth a second of her time. No waters, no napkins, no utensils, she didn't care to spend one second. Disgraceful. Too bad, we actually DID want beers.The lady at the takeout register took care of us (when it was obviously not her job), and I made sure to put the tip in her hands.",1,1,negative
2214,"Pequod's has excellent pizza with the caramelized crust. A big fan of the pizza.They do need to work on training their staff when you dine in the restaurant.We ordered a large Chicago Style Pizza with Onions, Pepperoni and Mushrooms. After having salad and waiting 45 minutes our pizza arrived with Onions, Sausage and Mushrooms. We told the server and she confirmed the ticket was given correctly but the kitchen screwed it up. (not sure how).  We told her we would just go ahead and eat it instead of waiting. (I don't particularly like sausage on pizza) We got our bill and nothing was taken off. Could have just taken off our drinks (2 ice teas) or the salad perhaps but even the $3 for the meat would have been fine. Or even an offer of a free dessert - We would have declined.I e-mailed Pequod's and didn't name our server (didn't want to get her in trouble) but just let them know this was not my expectation when their kitchen makes a mistake. I received no reply. I love the Pizza but think this place needs some training on making their customers seem valued.",7,2,negative
2215,"I hit up Lou's and Pequod's on my recent trip to Chicago and I have to admit Pequod's wins. It was a much more satisfying pizza that was still tasty on the flight home the next day.We ordered a sausage and giardiniera on our pie and they were fantastic. Quick comparison, Lou's has a thinner style crust that is formed into an pan and is really crispy and a thick layer of fresh cheese and a hearty very fresh tasting sauce, not very greasy even with the buttered crust. Pequod's on the other hand is a thicker crust formed into the pan that is amazingly flavorful and juicy, The cheese is dripping off the edge of the pie and is much more of your decadent style pizza cheese. The house made sausage is not as fully loaded across the pie as Lou's does but it is everywhere and it is very tasty and you can tell it is made fresh. The sauce is not as hearty as Lou's but is more flavorful (in my opinion). The giardiniera was this awesomely spicy little Italian pepper that really provided a great kick of spicy to the pizza. Think more long hots flavor than jalapeno. Finally, I think the caramelized crust wins over the buttered crust hands down. It is an awesome layer of crispy deliciousness!. It was worth trying both since it was my first time there but on my next visit it is Pequod's or bust. Side note: call ahead and get your name on the list. They don't do reservations but you can call on your way over because this place is packed and even after your wait it takes 35 minutes for your pies to cook. But that is the nature of the deep dish pies.",13,5,positive
2216,"Really disappointed. Maybe the pan pizza is better - we ordered two slices of the cheese thin crust, a salad, cheesy garlic bread and two bowls of soup. The cheesy garlic bread was okay - but they give you the smallest side of marinara sauce which I don't understand. They ask if you want the side, so why it isn't enough to dip the two pieces in? The soup was served lukewarm at best and nothing to write home about. The cheese pizza was dry and probably the blandest I've ever tasted. We brought home one of the two pieces (still not sure why - maybe hoping it would be better cold?) and it was even worse the next day. The Pequod's salad which is said to have pepperoncini's on it had one. Yep - just one itty bitty pepperocini and the same size serving of dressing that they give you for the marinara sauce with the cheesy garlic bread. Honestly folks - the sauce and the dressing can't cost you so much that you are going to lose money by increasing the portion size. Service was mediocre - had to hunt down the waitress for a refill. Probably will never go back.",4,6,negative
2217,"Absolutely unforgettable and delicious. I cannot believe I've lived in Chicago for 8 and 1/2 years and never tried It !  The atmosphere is cozy and darker, which is what I prefer. The staff is extremely friendly and PROUD of where they work. Our server was very excited that we were trying the pizza for the first time. We were starving so we also sampled almost every appetizer (mostly the fried stuff!). Lots of tasty dipping sauces :) Everything came out in a timely fashion and our drinks were never empty.It was busy because it was the same weekend as Riot Fest but I don't think we had to wait longer than 20 minutes for our table. We were able to find a spot at the bar and enjoy some strong drinks while we waited.Hands down, it's the best deep dish pizza I've ever had in Chicago.  I like it because the crust is light and fluffy instead of resembling pie crust. I can actually eat more than once piece at Pequods! If you have guests from out of town who want to try deep dish, skip all of the downtown places and go to Pequod's .",12,2,positive
2218,"I have to say, that this was a big win in terms of venue selections for the Chicago Pizza tour. My gf was in love with the pepperoni pizza. My Spinach slice was surprisingly good too. Though my issue is still with the consistency of the crust/bread portion.

The pizza was cooked perfectly, a cheesy masterpiece, and very flavorful overall.

Tough to accurately describe but basically tasted like a somewhat dry dinner roll with some melted cheese and sauce on top. It just really didn't work for me. I've had Chicago style deep dish pies elsewhere, such as Lou Malnati's, that blow the doors off of this place. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it's just not for me.

2230,"I want to start by saying the food is great - this review is specifically about our server, who on the check had her name as PP. (The busser said her name was either Katie or Kelly, but he was pretty unsure) - She had the worst service for us. She wasn't very attentive and did not care to refill our waters/sodas, give us napkins, or ask how we were doing; In conclusion she genuinely just did not care about us. She was not friendly. It was odd because she did appear to care a lot more about her other tables in her section. For every 3 times she went up to another table, she only came to us once after we had to flag her down. My group of 7 was very unimpressed with the service, and did not tip her at all.",4,2,negative

I also highly recommend their jalapeño poppers... I don't like jalapeños and still ogle over them! Service is normal, sometimes great, sometimes average!",8,1,positive

The appetizer combo was not bad - the jalepeno poppers were the best, so I think I would have just gone with those.Our deep dish was super yummy and surprisingly not too heavy. I've had deep dish before that left me feeling  uncomfortably full, but this deep dish was filling without the gross greasy feeling afterwards. We got mushrooms and fresh garlic toppings that were very fresh and delicious. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town.",7,5,positive
2234,"As my friend (Angie G.) took me around Chicago as a tourist, I was so excited to try this place! She ranted and raved that it was the best pizza I would ever put in my mouth. We ordered a big deep dish. I believed we ordered some sort of meat lover's special and she ordered the giardenara and pineapple. I had some of both and both were AMAZING. The taste was spot on, cooked to perfection, and it came out piping hot. The downside to this place is the wait time. It does take a long time for the pizzas to come out! However, I don't really mind this because I know my pizza was made to order. WARNING: I recently went back for a second visit during the lunch hour. I ordered a ""personal pizza"". OMG. Horrible. Do not order the personal pizzas. Stick to the big deep dish, their specialty! A night and day difference, I tell you.The service was good; the vibe is like a sports bar. A ""chill"" pizza joint where you can have a genuinely good time over pizza and beer. Go!",8,2,positive

The night I was there both floors were filled with a diverse clientele including young couples on a casual date night, college kids coming in for a study break, and large parties with three generations of family members all enjoying the food, college football, and atmosphere. The pizza was phenomenal, especially the sauce and the crust sets it apart from some of the other standard Chicago pizza favs. I personally love the fact that you get the idea this was once someone's home turned into a pizza joint that still makes you feel as comfortable as if you were in someone's home.It has become one of my all-time favorite Chicago pizzas!",7,2,positive
2238,"I have an open stomach that does not discriminate... but my first Chicago deep dish greatly disappoints. It was 1.5inch breading and a thin layer of cheese. The sausage one wasn't too bad since it did taste like an italian sausage pizza but the amount of carb to meat ratio was so very off. I have to agree with the other reviewers: the crusty crust that is slightly burnt makes the pizza. It was the most enjoyable part of the deep dish... which isn't saying much. I'm sure this restaurant makes other delicious items but on the deep dish alone I will not be enjoying that again until a later time.The restaurant itself looks hipster on the outside, backwater country bar on the inside. Dim lighting, tvs around. It is a bit of wait to get the pizza as well, ours was 30minutes.TLDR: NY style pizza is still the best pizza.",6,3,negative

2240,2nd time trying ..... 1 hour and 30 mins still no pizza. It's with the driver and could be another 20 mins according to the woman who answered the phone. No thanks.

2241,"Got a dope lunch special.  For $4.95 you get a personal pan pizza (7"") and a fountain drink OR pint of Bud Light.   Hard to beat for 5 dollars you get a pizza and a beer.  Special is M-F 11am-3pm.  Place was pretty empty for a lunch period which was great for me.  I wasn't trying to wait long to be seated. Overall the pizza was really good.  For lunch and the value it was great.  The edges were slightly burnt a lil too much for my liking but the pizza itself had lots of flavor.  The sauce was perfect and it has more than enough ground beef on it for me.  They definitely weren't stingy with the toppings.  Beer - Bud Light from a tap.  Not hard to mess up LOL.Place is essentially a pizza parlor, not restaurant.  So if you are looking for something classier, go somewhere else.  But if you are like me and just want quality food, affordable food and have the option of getting a drink as well, Pequod's is the place.  Next time I go back I'll likely try something else and see how the bartender pours and I'll update my review. You see I said next time right... I'll be back.",11,3,positive
2242,"My husband is obsessed with pizza, so when we were headed to Chicago for our engagement pictures, we had to stop at Pequods. We've tried all the other Chicago pizza places and this was next on our list. We really liked it. The crust is different. I believe it's caramelized. I was told to ask. For extra sauce and I'm so glad we did. Our only issue was the wait - super crowded and you can't make reservations. The appetizers were good too. We ordered the chicken fingers and fried mushrooms. This place is really popular in Chicago so get there early!",5,2,positive
2243,"we came here to watch the world cup game and made reservations ahead of time just in case.  when we arrived they weren't too busy and we were immediately seated.we ordered some cheesy garlic bread to start and then a medium pizza.  we really struggled to finish our pizza since it was so filling.  most of it was bread and it was too dense.  i usually only eat the toppings anyways, but i'm guessing people would be disappointed since most of the pizza was bread.  i was hoping for more cheese and even the caramelized cheese on the crust was not very good.",1,4,negative
2244,"Long wait, but pretty worth it. My favorite element in pizza is the tomato sauce and pequods douse their pizzas in a deliciously sweet tomato sauce. Really like their cheese and the oven burnt crust was incredible. The dough component was just ok but overall good pizza can be found here. Loved that it was Blackhawks themed!One negative that sticks out was that the hostess seemed overworked. She crossed our name off the waitlist twice, messed up the number of people in our party, and we weren't seated until we went up to her a third time and asked how much longer the wait would be.",7,0,positive
2245,"I have my reservations about Pequods, but I do have to admit their caramelized crust on their pan pizza is something I dream about. Went down to Pequod's with a few friends a couple Saturdays ago around 5pm. We were hoping to make it a quick visit to get back home for a football game, but were told about an hour and a half wait. By the time we actually got seated it was 7:30pm, and then you need to wait about another hour for your pan pizza to cook. We got a thin crust and a pan, both were great. I still think I prefer Lou Malnati's more bready crust edges on the deep dish, but our group was split half and half on that one. Thin crust was excellent, plenty of food for four of us with a medium thin and pan. Overall, don't know that the five hour trip is worth the pizza when there are places like Lou's around.",5,1,negative

2247,"The third stop on the pizza tour and the second deep dish pizza we tried.  I got the pepperoni and the bf got spinach.  The pepperoni deep dish was absolutely the BEST pizza I've had during the entire trip in Chicago and the best deep dish pizza I'd ever had (well, out of about four different choices).  There was a decent amount of sauce with a perfectly caramelized crust.  I wish we ate here first so I wasn't so full of unsatisfactory pizza.  The place was pretty crowded and loud when we arrived.  We were seated upstairs but the tour guide had called ahead for our orders so the wait time wasn't long at all.  This is probably not the usual case though.  I would totally stop by on my next Chicago visit.",5,2,positive
2248,"Honestly to preface this, I'm sorry, I'm just not a fan of deep dish pizza, it's not my thing so don't take my review too seriously. Got the deep dish pizza and while it's good, I wouldn't really go out of my way to go get another one any time soon. The lunch special looks like a steal though. I just prefer east coast (NYC) pizza. Sorry guys, I wasn't a convert.",3,2,negative
2249,"My 2nd favorite pizza place next to Giordonos!Came in on a Sunday night around 7PM and wait was about 15 minutes.I really like the bar vibe at this restaurant and sportsplaying in the background.Pizza was amazing! took about 40-45 minutes to bake a deep dishand they are super generous with the topping you order. Servicewas good too, nothing to complain about! definitely make a visit!",6,1,positive
2250,"Deep dish ain't pizza; it's lasagna with bread. That's cool, though. It still tastes pretty good, and I've yet to meet a native Chicagoan who will fight to the death to defend his city's pizza as the finest creation known to man.That said, I've eaten my fair share of deep dish and figured it's always good to have a place in your back pocket for when the family and friends come to visit. I've done the big three gauntlet and Lou Malnati's is my winner. However, I asked around for the best ""local"" spot to grab a deep dish slice, and the answer came back Pequod's.Pequod's is small, grungy, and really looks like half a bar than serves pizza on the side. But aside from all that, Pequod's actually makes a rather nice pie. There's nothing special on the menu, just the basics. Start with a cheese, and ingredient your way up.I was already massively hungry, so we ordered jalapeno poppers to start. I'll take the cheddar/yellow/orange filling over cream cheese any day of the week, so Pequod's already got off the blocks well. Still not as good as Jack in the Box, which makes an incomparable popper. But good.Pequod's deep dish, unlike the Big 3, isn't overzealous with the bread. It's still a chore to eat, but for different reasons. Pequod's says it caramelizes its crust, but what that really means is they char it to a crisp. For a guy that loves blackened anything (especially char on brisket), I loved it. Aside from the char, the breading is thinner than the typical deep dish, and much easier to eat. The sauce is plentiful (another check mark in my book), and although I'd heard that Pequod's goes easy on the cheese, the white stuff was still overkill for me. The tomato sauce came extra sweet, almost, say, Pizza Hut style as opposed to the more pomodoro/crushed tomato sourish taste.",20,3,positive
2251,"Hands down my favorite pizza! Introduced to this pizza a few months ago and now any time in Chicago I order it!  Really wish they delivered to Florida as I've been craving their cheese burnt crust -- mm mmm good!

2252,"Best chicago style pizza in the city. I don't always eat deep dish, but when I do, it is Pequod's. Take your out of town friends here or order for pick-up or delivery. Get gardinera on the pizza! Adds another dimension of Chicago flavor and heat!",0,0,positive

2254,"Had a 9 hour layover in Chicago on my way to LA. Figured it would be inappropriate for me to spend a few hours in Chicago without having a deep dish pizza. After asking the locals, it seemed like this establishment had the best deep dish pizza in town... And it seems like they were right - it's hard to believe there's a better deep dish pizza.The crust was caramelized and incredibly delicious. The cheese... it was orgasmic... no better way to describe it. Each toppings (we got pepperoni, sausage and basil) were so flavourful, you can taste each one with every bite!The servers were very hospitable and friendly.Highly recommend this place!",10,2,positive
2255,"This is the best pizza in Chicago. It's also a little off the beaten path, so it is mostly locals, which is nice.  It's still always busy and will generally have at least a 30 minute wait, but it's worth it.  Pro tip: Get the personal pizza, as it's about right for one hungry person and it maximizes the caramelized crust.  Also, their lunch special is the best deal in the city.  It used to be $4.95 for a personal pizza, salad and drink, though it may be a bit more now.",5,0,positive
2256,"Giordano's has always been our Chicago pizza go-to, but a friend asked us to meet him here, so away we went. Let me tell you, that crust? Like unicorns and pixie dust magic.

Beer selection was ok, but honestly, I'd drink my own sweat if I had to to have another piece of that pizza.",3,1,positive

2259,Excellent pizza.  This place is better than pizanos in my opinion. A good tip for the thin crust pizza is to get a side of marinara sauce.  It's delicious,3,0,positive
2260,"Really good deep dish, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype or was the holy grail of deep dish like some Yelpers made it seem out to be. The pizza tasted like any other ol' deep dish pizza until you get to the crispy, burnt crust, which was indeed delicious, but not really a deal maker in my opinion. I did really like that they heaped on the toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives) and thought that the cheese/sauce ratio was perfect. My table also ordered the appetizer sampler, which was yummy because we were starving, but nothing special (besides the jalapeno poppers which were gross and filled with Cheez Wiz type cheese). Like other Yelpers have said, the service here is definitely lacking. My friend pre-ordered the pizza at 7 PM and said we'd be coming in at 7:45 PM and the waiter rudely asked my friend to call back at 7:15 PM to place the order since the pies take 30 min. My friend then just suggested that they just write down our order and put it in at 7:15, which thankfully they agreed to. This kind of left a bad taste in our mouths, especially since the pizza wasn't ready until about 8:15 anyways.Overall, I think Pequods is a place that everyone who likes deep dish should try, but don't expect it to be out of this world if you've eaten a lot of deep dish because it's not much different from other good pizza joints (e.g., Lou Malnati's, Ginos East).",10,3,positive
2261,"If you only have time to try one pizza place in Chicago, I highly recommend Pequod's. Definitely worth the trip from downtown. Between Lou's, Gino's and Giordano's, I thought Pequod's tasted the best. Their crust differentiates them from the rest. It is most like what a real pizza should taste like. It is crispy, but not dry and it actually has a flavor to it. The others are tasteless and like biting into a brick.Pizza is absolutely delicious and this Italian thinks their Italian Beef is excellent as well.",9,1,positive
2262,"Worst service I've ever had! I used to be a server for years so I am very understanding. We had a reservation for 6:30 and they told us it would be a half hour wait! Then after an hour and 25 minutes we asked to order our pizza at the bar till we got our table. They refused and ""said"" we were the next table. I asked to speak to the manager and he was so rude to my friend. He even said, ""you need to take your friend out of here."" I have never experienced such horrible service.

2264,"Deep dish pizza? No, cornbread with a dash of sauce and toppings is more accurate. I'm amazed at how hyped this place is, I came into town expecting the best deep dish! I was severely disappointed. I think the ingredients were great, but the ratios totally off! The pizza was 80% bread! Fine, you made A pizza in a deep dish..but definitely not the best.

It was quite bready as well, so if you're looking for cheese, look elsewhere. The sauce is good though, and they do a good job with amount of toppings. My favorite deep dish is still Lou Malnati's, but I'm not against variety, so I'm glad this place is around as well!",11,0,negative

2267,"My first Chicago deep dish pizza! I didn't realize Pequods is so highly rated - love my cousins for taking me here.It was a Tuesday night, seemed like a medium size crowd. No wait. I believe we ordered pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and green pepper on a pan pizza. It took a noticeably long time for the pizza to get to our table, but it was worth the wait. It tasted fresh, filling, and scrumptious. I don't think it's something I could eat too often, but it's definitely a good meal.Great deep dish pizza experience, even with the long wait.

2273,"One of my new favorite deep dish pizza spots. I've been to Giordano's, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and now this one and Gino's East will be my ""go-to"" places for pizza on my Chicago trips.The wait wasn't terrible - on a Saturday evening, we had a party of 8 call ahead to be put down on the list, and we waited for 5-10 minutes when we got there. Much better than the lines at Gino's East, and I love the fact that you can call ahead of time to get put on a ""priority list"" for faster seating when you get there.As an appetizer, we got wings which were pretty unmemorable, and a fried sampler assortment ($8.95) of mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks and jalapeno poppers. Everything was fried in the same batter, so it was pretty much a guess as to what you were actually eating until you put it in your mouth. I liked the deep fried mushrooms that I had, but I like most deep-fried things. The Cheesy Garlic Bread ($3.95) is just okay. Save your carbs for the pizza. Ditto on the salad - it was good and made us feel slightly better about carb-heavy dinner, but it was nothing to write home about.The pizza on the other hand was phenomenal. The crust was crispy and not soggy in the middle; the tomato sauce was the right proportion and the amount of cheese was just right. I loved both the pepperoni pizza and the sausage & spinach pizza that we got. I think less toppings is more when it comes to ordering, so that the toppings don't completely overwhelm the crust, tomato, and cheese. The large size is pretty generous, and being 8 girls, most people ate 1.5 slices each.The price is affordable too - we paid $25 a piece which included beer, appetizers, salad, and 2 large pizzas (split between 8 people). Would highly recommend over Lou Malnati's and Giordano's and I'm looking forward to coming back here again for more!",18,5,positive

2302,"Just... nope, can't eat here again. And it IS the pizza for me. The pizza dough is SO dense and bready so there needs to be a lot more sauce if they're not going change the recipe. That, or quit over-kneading it. As a Chicagoan raised on Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, Pequod's doesn't compare to them. Sorry... =\",0,1,negative

2304,I felt the need to come back (heartbroken) to talk about my uneventful delivery order. Ordered the usual large sausage pizza. We added hot wings and mozzarella sticks this time to change it up. Pizza - soggyMozzarella sticks- soggy and coldHit wings- umm high school mystery meat? That's all I have to say.

However the pizza was so MEH. Idk why, maybe I expected sobering other worldly? The cheesy part of the crust was great, the sauce good, toppings were fine. The dough sucked tho, I wasn't really feeling the entire thing. Oh well, next time I'm in Chicago I'll try another!",5,3,negative

2309,Came to Chi-town for vacation so naturally we needed to get some deep dish pizza! Pequod's Pizza was recommended to us by our Uber & it was INCREDIBLE.

2310,"Let me tell you I was so excited to finally try the pizza my family raves about all the time. Unfortunately, right when I entered I waited 5-10 minutes at the door when the bartender and the host were talking. I was seated after with no menu and had to get up to ask for one. Server took 20 minutes to approach my table and another 20 min for a glass of water. Our appetizers arrived and our sample platter was undercooked. The batter was soggy from the inside and the mushrooms were dried out. The two tables after us had gotten their pizza and my table was still waiting. The pizza arrives after an hour of waiting on a slow Monday night and it was wrong. I'm a vegetarian and was given a sausage mushroom pizza when I asked for half sausage and half spinach. The waitress came back and rudely said we had to wait another 45 min for another pizza and didn't offer an apology. I was I furious by this point I paid and left. I paid for horrible service and food. I called the restaurant and a lady under the name Mariah picks up, without any greeting and says ""hey"" I explained to her what happened and reads 6 different orders but my order. She says ""I can't do nothing for you you can call Thursday Shawn will be here and will fix your problem"". My server was a medium height African American woman: Save your time and money try Lou Malnati's",2,4,negative
2311,"This pizza is nothing short of amazing!My friend and I were shopping in the area and decided to stop in for an early dinner one night.  Luckily, because it was around 4PM we were seated right away.  My friend had been there before so she recommended the deep dish and the fried zucchini.  We ended up getting 1 personal deep dish pizza, 1 personal thin crust pizza and fried zucchini for an appetizer.  The service was quick-- even when the restaurant started to get very busy around 5PM.  The fried zucchini was very good and held us over until the deep dish pizza was done!  When the pizza did come out it was cooked to perfection.  It's important to note that the deep dish takes significantly longer to cook so make sure to time it right when you order.I'll definitely be back.  If you don't want to have to wait I would recommend making a reservation, or calling for take-out as the restaurant itself is not very big and there is always a line by the door.",8,3,positive
2312,"Ridiculously amazing lunch special -personal pizza with a fountain drink for 4.95!  The cheesy and crunchy crust and generous toppings (of course at an extra charge) make the pizza one of the better pan pizzas I've ever had. The only turn offs I had related to the iced tea - it was pretty awful -super watery and just didn't taste good period. And the bathroom was very dated (small stalls, good luck to the ladies who are a little bigger boned or have bigger booties like myself) and dirty.  Otherwise, great place to eat...you may just want to hold your pee until you get home so you can avoid the bathroom!",9,4,positive

I either caught them on a bad day, or my brother has bad taste in pizza. The presentation was awful, the sauce and crust were bland and the veggies were cut too big and were undercooked, totally watering down the pizza. My brother reckons if I'd skipped the veg I'd have had a better experience. However, given the blandness of the sauce and crust, I am not so sure about that.",4,4,negative

In a city with Lous, Ginos, and Uno/Due, this is probably the last place I would recommend going to.",1,2,negative
2317,"Was seated immediately and the staff was great and got us our beverages quick. We ordered 2 personal pan pizzas which was more than enough.Be prepared to wait around 40 minutes to get your pizza, you will understand why it took so long once you see it. I got pepperoni, hamburger and extra cheese and It was delicious. The cheese was caramelized golden brown on the sides and that's why the crust was my favorite part. The hamburger was literally a burger they cooked then cut up in big chunks and put on the pizza.Great environment and made us feel like we were where the locals were in Chicago. BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD.",5,0,positive
2318,"Best deep dish pizza in the city of Chicago!  Buzzing and energetic atmosphere with a great staff and service.  Splitting a deep dish with another person is ideal so it's a great date spot (especially if it's a first date because its a fun, casual spot).  Also not a bad spot to go with a group of friends to watch the Cubs or Hawks.  If you haven't been here yet, you have to give it a try.",5,1,positive

2321,"Amazing pizza! Lou Malnati's and Pequod's take my picks as the best pizza in town. My sister and I called in for reservations, and we were seated in two minutes when we arrived. We ordered a medium deep dish pizza with sausage, onions, and jalapeños. Everything was so flavorful: the toppings, the tomato sauce, etc. The caramelized crust won't be for all (more burnt than caramelized), but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. People always try to make the argument for best pizza, etc. I'll tell you straight up: neither Lou Malnati's nor Pequod's ever blew my mind, but it's still well worth the visit. Comparing Lou Malnati's and Pequod's is a different story. If you want a nice sit-down restaurant, go to Lou Malnati's in the Loop. If you want a bar to watch a sports game in a nice college-feel area, go to Pequod's. The pizza in both places is fantastic.",8,0,positive

2328,"Let me start off with stating that this place would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the ridiculous prices to add on simple items like mushrooms. I always go here when I'm in Chicago. Yes it is hyped up, but I find that the quality of the toppings and cheese are much better than Lou's IMO.The crust is a bit softer, but that's how I like my pizza....I mean, pie. It's a PIE. I think that's important to note. But yes, I added 5 toppings? Maybe 6. Basically made ours a supreme and it was $50!!!! WHAT? But knowing myself, I'll be back again regardless. It really is something you just have to try. You may like it, you may not. But what I can guarantee is that you'll be impressed with the serving size. No one can beat that 1 inch + deep dish slice.",9,1,positive
2329,"Mouthgasm. They aren't bragging when they speak highly of their crust--it's the damn truth. Crispy and seasoned in all the right places (even in the deepest depths of the bottom of the pizza), it was hands down the most favorite part of the entire pie.However, the sauce and meats did not disappoint either. They, too, were incredibly flavored in their own aspects, and both upheld the overall complex flavors of the pizza throughout its entirety.We came in on a Friday evening, Valentine's Day nonetheless, expecting a ridiculous wait. Surprise! The girls in the party were greeted with roses and we were escorted upstairs, down the hall, and into a nice private booth in the corner almost immediately. Service was a bit far and few in between, but our appetizers and pizza came out in a reasonable amount of time.The appetizer combo had an assortment of various fried & breaded items, adequate for our party of 5, but because we were starving, we had wished it came with a few more items than it did. It came with mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, zucchini slices and mushrooms.We shared a large pie amongst the 5 of us, and slices themselves are decently large. I ate 1.5 slices myself. I could've eaten 2, but was feeling shy and lady-like. The only other complaint I heard within our table was that we wished there had been more cheese in the pizza. Regardless, a very minor complaint, and overall, Pequod's was a winner.",9,7,positive

Pequod's got us seated in under 20 minutes and what followed was possibly the best pizza experience I've ever had. The pizza was fabulous. Pan pizza, caramelized cheese around the crust, and the flavor was out of this world. We will be returning to eat here again, wouldn't think twice about it. Also, the staff was very friendly.",4,1,positive
2334,For one i do not like pizza. Theyre pizza is nothing fabulous. Staff isnt that great. Cesaer salad was average and a bit warm. Garlic cheese bread i could do with out. They have good marinara sauce for the mozz sticks that are good. I love their ginger ale pop though. Never want to come here again. Place was really cute and nice though. Set up a bit odd. They have a bathroom thats coed and then a girl n guys bathroom. They have a bar as well.

2337,"Probably my favorite Chicago pizza place!Not exactly deep dish, but it certainly different from any ordinary pizza place. What makes Pequod's pizza awesome is their crust, which is buttery, garlicky and perfectly crisped/caramelized... yum! The pizza ingredients are also always so fresh too!This place has two stories, first floor seems small, but once you go to the second floor, there's a lot of tables, the three times I've been, I never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.Located in Lincoln Park, so if you're visiting the city, just know that this isn't located in the loop so you'll most likely have to drive or take the El(subway). This place is a must for Chicago style pizza!",4,0,positive
2338,Deep dish and thin crust are both still the best in Chicago! And everyone knows Chicago has the best pizza in the U.S.  I've been coming here for more than a decade and the quality has been consistent throughout.  Always made with plenty of fresh toppings and a perfectly baked snappy crust.  I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.,6,0,positive

2340,"I have to agree with another reviewer that the reviews of this place have to be inflated or fake.  I finally ordered from Pequod's and I cannot believe how tasteless the pizza is.  I ordered 2 pizzas and a pan pizza to make a decent judgment call and my family and I could not get past one piece.  This is nothing but bland bread with thick ragu and some cheese.  The pan pizza was just thicker bread with more ragu and burnt cheese!  One of our pizza's had sausage, we honestly thought they were more like meatballs and again.....tasteless!!  There are hundreds of small pizza places in a 5 mile radius of this place that know how to make a knock out pizza that represents what pizza is supposed to be......go there and skip this.  I now understand why there is always a line....it's dirt cheap.....if it were expensive they would have closed years ago.",2,7,negative
2341,"Let's start with the good stuff, and most important part of the review. The pizza - always delicious, so tasty, and the crust is unbeatable. For the occasional craving for deep dish, this is a definitely a favorite. Be warned you'll be salivating and impatiently waiting while your pizza is cooked to perfection.Minus one star for service - Placing your order for pizza doesn't necessarily ensure they actually place the order. We ended up waiting for about an hour for a pie, half an hour of which could have been avoided if they had started baking when we placed the order. Also, our server never asked if we wanted appetizers, drinks, etc, or came by our table during our wait. Very disorganized in that sense. I understand it's a busy place but not checking on a table for almost an hour is no bueno. That being said, the staff was friendly.",6,3,positive
2342,"I'm always reluctant to leave five star reviews for my favorite restaurants because I'd still like to be able to get a table when I visit - but Pequod's is already a madhouse on most nights so I doubt one more glowing review is going to change much. I love eating here - the atmosphere is old-school pizzeria and the food is amazing. I was on the Gino's East bandwagon for the first few years I lived in the city, but I always direct people to Pequod's now when they are looking for what I consider Chicago's best deep dish. I wish I liked sports so I had more of a reason to stay in here longer than my meal warrants (and possibly order another meal eventually) but all the screens with hockey, football or whatever really doesn't distract from the meal. They can accommodate very large groups - but make sure to give them a heads up. Also we love the giardiniera as a pizza topping. Burnt cheese on the crust?! So good!!",9,3,positive

2344,"For my money, this is the best ""Chicago style"" pizza in the city. Caramelized crust, great sauce and toppings, gooey melty cheese. This place is nostalgic for me. While visiting Chicago before I lived here, I heard Pequad's was the best deep dish around. I was staying in Bridgeport and had no idea how to use Chicago public transportation, so it took forever to get to Lincoln Park, and it was raining. It was all worth it when we ordered a pizza and a pitcher of beer. That weekend I decided to move to Chicago and put down roots. Every time I've come back since it's been easier to get here but the pizza has been just as good. If I could change anything, I would expand the beer list.",6,0,positive
2345,"Damn, do I love pizza!Pequods is so amazing! Get their pan, otherwise you're wasting your time. Everything is delish, I drool thinking about their pizza. There is usually a wait for delivery, but rest assured it's worth it! If you're dining in get some cheesy bread and wings (also great when delivered!). You don't come here for atmosphere, you come for 'za. But damn, is it good! Worth the wait!!",5,3,positive
2346,"Hit up Pequod's Pizzeria on a busy Friday evening to finally see if the hype lives up.  I definitely recommend signing up for Priority Seating because it works, our party only waited 15 minutes.  After snaking up and through the building, we were seated on the top floor and quickly ordered some brews.  We then ordered 3 appetizers: zucchini chips ($5), mozzarella sticks ($7) and a full caesar salad ($9).  I'm impressed with the zucchini chips because they appear house-made but the order consisted of a measly 8 small pieces with dip.  Mozzarella sticks were standard and the caesar salad was a bit too plain but both were better servings than the zucchini chips.The main dish was the classic, large pan pizza with 5 toppings and one premium (taking the base $19 all the way to $39!!!, each topping is $3 and premium is $5, I mean damn!! way too inflated for non-meat options): garlic, tomato, mushroom, onion and meatballs.  Ok definitely do no more than 3 toppings and a meat because otherwise the pie is a mess.  Our pizza was served with an explosion of toppings but of unequal quantity and distribution.  Plus the topics were so crudely chopped that it became annoying grabbing a piece of onion or tomato and grabbing the whole slice.  Even with fork and knife, the toppings are too big.   The crust was good but was too thick, the pizza was almost 70% crust.  The sauce and cheese could not save the pizza from being mostly dough-tasting and the toppings didn't stick or integrate.  When the meatballs were hit, they were a nice addition with good taste and texture.  Yes the crispy cheese crust was amazing but there was so little of it, not as satisfying.Hate to say it but my pizza was almost bland, due to dough amount and few (attached) toppings, my fiancé even attempted to salt her slice.  I see Pequod's potential but my lack of enthusiasm is partially based on my crazy order and abundance of toppings.  Still, the amount of dough in each bite is enough to want to cut the slice in half, horizontally.  The environment is crazy hectic and wait staff is average so they keep my static.  The prices were a bit killer but it's definitely the reputation.  No worries, I'll be back and will make more careful considerations.",14,11,negative
2347,"Pan style pizza was really good. Appetizers were ok.  However, I still give it 3 stars for the poor service: we had to go to the bar to order more drinks as none of the waitresses has been around for too long; they told us about 40 min long wait for pizza only after we ordered..but we also were seated on the second floor. I noticed service on the first floor was faster or at least it looked livelier there.",2,0,negative

Oh wow, are you really going to tell me that this is heaven? I was floored with the place, but the pizza took me to another level with its crispy edges of cheese. Oh was I going to HELL for enjoying this way too much. I started off of course with a salad, that actually had cheese in the shape of a whale, my friend told me that it is the whale from one of the books, I forget which one. I am hearing that it is hard to get a seat on Fridays and Saturdays, but we came on a Sunday afternoon and it was really not bad. I am one to admit, this pizza really took me there.

They were pretty quick in getting our reservation so that was awesome. We were seated on the second floor.We shared appetizers. I thought the stuffed mushrooms were decent. I enjoyed it - it wasn't soggy and had the right crisp. The filling werent full of mushroom juice either. My friend ordered 4 types of deep dish pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, and spinach). I had a slice of the sausage and mushroom. It was decent. LOTS of crust though. Felt like I was eating bread! I would prefer less crust. For the spinach pizza there was barely any spinach on the pizza. Some of my friends who had the spinach pizza said it was more of a cheese pizza :(. The mushroom pizza were done fast!We also had cheesy garlic bread which was okay too. We had a reservation from 7pm and stayed til almost 11pm. We were the only ones there but they didnt kick us out. A friend realize they were cleaning up so we decided to leave. It was nice of them to not kick us out. Overall decent pizzeria, but not my favorite.

2351,"This is hands down the best pizza in Chicago!... Quite honestly the best pan pizza I've ever had. Let's start with, this pizza can blow your mind! It's not like any other crust. The crust is most def what makes it unique. It's a Caramelized crust, or basically pizza baked in an old seasoned black pan and burns the cheese on top. Whatever way you put it, it's delicious! Simple is def better, pepperoni is where it's at!If you want a good appetizer, try the Jalapeño poppers. They are pretty good! The reason for only 4 stars is a few things, all of which is to be expected with such a high traffic/ crazy busy restaurant but still worth noting! It is so inconsistent there! I am a frequent carry out customer (at least every other Sunday-hey like I said, it's my favorite!) Sometimes the pizza is hot hot hot, sometimes It's not! (not not!) Sometimes it's super cheesy, sometimes it's super saucey and other days, it's dry! You just don't really know. You may walk in on time and it's done or sometimes you end up waiting an additional 20 minutes. It's a guessing game for sure!Overall, just go!

This place was good but at the end I we all just started picking off the toppings and the delicious burnt cheese that was stuck to the crust.The service was okay.

The pizza was really good... but the only reason ibdidnt five them 5 stars was because if the appetizers and the presentation of the appetizers.

The service was quick! I was really impressed! Can't wait to go back again. Definitely recommend this place!",7,0,positive
2367,"First off, I love pizza just as much as the next man and Pequods is no different. The crust is good, the sauce is good, the pizza is good. The portions are good, the apps are good, the beer is good. Most of all I like the place with the Chicago sports vibe all over and even on the workers uniform.Everytime I frequent Pequods I leave in a pizza coma and that's a good problem. They would really win my heart over and the fifth star if they had bacon. Canadian bacon? Wheretheydothat@?",10,0,positive
2368,"This review is for a recent visit on 7/8/16 at 12:30am. The restaurant was quite busy for a late Thursday / early Friday but the service definitely met expectations. Our waitress was extremely friendly and assertive while taking our orders. She seemed exhausted since it was near closing, but her customer service wasn't interfered by her exhaustion. As always, the food came out to be delicious and just as expected. The appetizer sampler is a must have for anyone that wants to try a variety of items. To top it off, our deep dish pizza did a great job of satisfying our cravings. Will be returning soon!",6,2,positive
2369,I'm obsessed with their deep dish. The best I've tried so far!I traveled from the south side of Chicago just to try it out and I'm extremely impressed. Will most definitely be back sometime soon. Worth it,2,0,positive
2370,"I went to Chicago to experience deep dish pizza and while it is good, it is not anywhere near as good as NYC pizza.  In terms of deep dish for Chicago, two locations stood out to me; this and Lou Malnati's.  This is hands down better than Lou's but both are good.  If you are staying in the loop, Malnati's would be a great alternative, but if you don't mind traveling, go to Pequod's.  Pequod's had a much better vibe to it and I didn't feel like I was at a chain restaurant.  The service was a little slower here, but it was worth the wait.",8,1,positive
2371,"Tied for my favorite pizza place in Chicago. Fighting with Coalfire for #1. But they couldn't be more different, so I think it's okay to have two favorites.Why do I love Pequod's? 1-They do take reservations!2-One piece generally fills me up so I have leftovers for the next few days3-The crispy edge on the pizza! Sooooo good!4-Cheese! They totally get this right!I've only had dine-in pizza from here, so I can't review their deliveries.The staff is always super friendly and on top of refills. I love that this place is a good family restaurant. Almost seems suburban!",9,0,positive
2372,Admittedly biased since I love deep dish...The place was packed and we were ushered to a stairway in the back of the building. Much to my surprise there was a second level which was also packed.  I loved every type of pizza they offered here.,2,1,positive
2373,"I am on vacation in Chicago and went yesterday. What a mistake!My friend/host during this trip called ahead and made a ""priority seating"" arrangement for our four person party for 7pm. We arrived a bit early and checked in. We were told that our ""priority seating"" got us a 45 min - 1 hour wait. Uh, ok. So we go outside and wait. After 1 hour we check back in, only to be told that we have ""at least another half hour"" to wait. We're disappointed, but we wait. After half an hour, we check back in. Again, we are told that we have ""at least another half hour."" So the 45 min - 1 hour wait that we were promised turned into a 2 hour minimum wait. Ridiculous. We mulled over our options and decided to stick it out. We finally got seated around 9pm. After we were seated, three of us ordered beers and we asked the waitress about pizza ordering time (we tried to see if we could pre-order while we were outside, but were told they don't do that after 5pm on weekends). She told us that the pizza would take up to an hour and 25 minutes to arrive. Good grief.After several minutes, the waitress brings me my Blue Moon. But a lot of time goes by and my two friends' beers are nowhere to be seen. We flag down the waitress and it turns out she lost their order, so she has to retake it. Finally, the pizza arrives. I got a personal pizza with ground beef, mushrooms, and garlic. Just FYI, some people will tell you the pan crust is deep dish, but it is not. The ground beef was under seasoned (actually, the pizza as a whole was, come to think of it) and there's not enough cheese on it. I had to keep adding parmesan and oregano. All in all, horrible experience. Spent nearly 4 hours on eating mediocre pizza. I will never come back and I'm going to make sure to tell other visiting friends to stay away!",3,2,negative
2374,"This place has been on my ""Pizza Wish List"" for years.  Finally had a chance to try one of their deep dish pizzas yesterday.The crust is similar to Lou Malnati's.  The sauce is much sweeter, you can really taste the basil in the sauce  The cheese is nice and smooth.Overall, a decent pie.Warning: ""caramelized crust"" = blackened/charred/burned on the edges.",2,0,positive

2376,"What an absolute let down. I go to Chicago often for work and a good friend always kept pushing Pequods. I finally relented and what a disappointment.First I did order delivery- and that was a part of the issue. Was given a 90 minute time frame, arrived in 105 mins. Got upstairs opened it up and it's the wrong pie. Ordered sausage and onions and this one is covered in pineapple.I call and after an apology and am offered store credit (really? No refund) or a new pie. I take the pizza and given a 40 minute time frame or sooner I'm told.Hour goes by, I call and am told its on the way. Finally shows up after 75 minute wait. Yes I waited over three hours for my pizza.Opened all excited, looks great, but it's just not good. Tomato sauce tastes cheap, crust is soft, the whole thing is a mess. Will never go back. I recommend you go elsewhere as well.Update-- Pequods emailed me an apology and saying they will work to ensure that issue doesn't happen to anyone else again. Much appreciated Pequods- makes me want to give them another shot, however it will be dine- in this time!!",10,2,negative
2377,"Went on a busy Saturday night last weekend and the wait was ridiculous. We ended up squeezing in at the bar and ordered drinks and our pizzas. The drinks were delicious; definitely some of the best Patron margaritas I've ever had. After about 40 minutes our pizzas came out and they were huge, hot and fresh. We had deep dish sausage and pepperoni. They were very bread-y, but the sauce and cheese was plentiful and flavorful. After two slices I was stuffed and satisfied. It didn't take the top spot on my list for Chicago deep dish, but it's a pretty close second.",8,1,positive
2378,"Like any other normal American visiting Chicago, I wanted some pizza. I wanted some good pizza. I wanted what the locals eat, and I wanted a lot of it. This is my experience at Pequod's... it's a bit of a read, but it should give an idea of what you can expect. Hey, I don't eff around with Yelp reviews like other goons who say, ""Mm. Tasty. Go here."" and call it a review... nuh-uh. Here's a tale, my friends...First of all, if it weren't for the big fat five star rating above this review, you'd probably think I absolutely hated Pequod's until the end of it. On a Saturday night at around 7:30 or so, I came with a party of four and made a reservation: ""Your wait will be about forty-five minutes to an hour."" After walking back outside and seeing about twenty people sitting around, I knew that was probably a lie, but whatever. I'll wait.Forty-five minutes go by and I decide it'd be best to order my pizza before getting our table -- done and done: a large pan pizza with sausage and pepperoni. Another twenty minutes later, I go back in after noticing a party of six that got there way after us got a table. I was about to freak my shit, but then I figured they had a reservation. Still, a little while longer, there was a group of four that got to Pequod's soon after we did that got seated. At that point, I went inside and asked how much longer, and they said ""There are about four tables in front of you, so maybe about twenty minutes?"" I was so hungry at this point that I wasn't even mad ... and I get mega cranky when I'm hungry. After walking outside and telling my group that the wait would be even *longer*, they started walking away. After they got about a block away (I was still in line. No way in hell was I going to just leave after already waiting over an hour), we got buzzed in. Fucking FINALLY. I assume that the reservation people dun goofed their shit and overlooked my party, and got us a table ASAP before we left.We got sat down in the far back corner in the right of the restaurant, which worked well with me. Pequod's is a pretty tiny place, so being away from all the elbows is probably for the best. To get some food in our stomachs, we got the mozerella sticks, which were said to be a ""must buy"" from some reviewers here. I will say, I would definitely agree with that had the cheese been more melted. The breading on them is great, and the marinara dipping sauce is perfect.After about ten to fifteen minutes of MORE waiting, our pre-ordered pizza came. What a work of art. Huge pieces of sausage basically gave the equivalent of one full link per slice, and there was a generous amount of pepperoni. Pequod's doesn't skimp like some other places -- there's nothing worse than paying over $2 for an additional topping and getting only a few pieces.This may be the best pizza I've ever had... as good as the toppings and sauce were, the crust truly makes Pequod's stand out. Chewy, crispy, burnt (well, they call it caramelized)... damn, I could eat this just about any day. It's rare that I, or anybody that I talk to, can excuse such an excessive wait time no matter how awesome the food is, but this is an exception.Altogether, I probably waited about 90 minutes until I got in and ate my pizza. If I hadn't ordered my pizza beforehand, it would probably have been two full hours. In the future, I'll *have* to call ahead and make a reservation, because as unbelievably delicious as this pizza is, I have a hard time waiting over an hour at a restaurant.Pequod's doesn't exactly have what many people associate as ""deep dish"", ""Chicago-style"" pizza, but it does have an unreal pan pizza that will satisfy your tastebuds... legendary.",20,13,positive
2379,"Best freaking deep dish around. The crust itself is airy and awesome and Carmelized (what they are known for)! Not a bit soggy. Layered with the perfect amount of cheese with your choice in toppings and probably some of the best marinara on top. The breaded mushrooms with the homemade ranch was also amazing and the zucchini slices weren't bad either. But prepare yourself, the wait is long but you can call ahead and do a seat reserve to move your name ahead on the list. You'll still have to wait but they just bought fillipos two doors down and will give you 10% off at pequods. Get the personal pizzas with a group - more crust!",5,2,positive
2380,"Hands down the best for thicker crust pizza.  Make no mistake, this IS NOT deep dish.  It's pan pizza with a perfectly caramelized cheese melted on the crust.  Great toppings and sauce as well.  My fave in the city.  Lines can get crazy so call ahead and order take out.",4,2,positive

2382,"So I've had deep dish in California. I know I know that's not Chicago deep dish, except I liked it a whole lot better in CA.I thought the pepperoni at Pequods compared to that on pizza I buy at the grocery store. The pep had little texture and resembled rubber in my opinion. The sauce was very runny with little cheese on the pizza. The browned crusty edges that I look forward to eating on crusts fell off the slices as if they were burnt greasy edges.I came here since it was highly recommended by a local and either I came on an off day or true Chicago style deep dish is not for me. From the reviews seems like it's the latter.I'll stick to my California deep dish. Good luck.",6,2,negative
2383,"Very good stuff.  Sauce was a little sweeter than I prefer, but heavy cheese makes you forget about it.  I'm not a fan of Chicago style pie honestly, but this was very representative in my opinion.  A bit heavy on the crust.  I had been warned to be prepared to wait, but we waltzed in at 6 pm on a Wednesday and went straight to a table.",2,1,positive
2384,So damn good.  Best Chicago style pizza in town. Their traditional style is really good too.  The staff is friendly but not intrusive too.  A must have every time I'm in Chicago.,3,2,positive
2385,"This place is pizza heaven. My college buddies who live in Chicago told me to eat there and they didn't steer me wrong. The crust was phenomenal. It's NOT your Chicago Deep Dish but that might make it more special. It's a tall darkened and caramelized crust that tastes great. I had sausage, pepperoni, and jalapeños and the meats were tender as could be. This is hands down one of the best and affordable pizza places I've visited, ever. You can't beat their small pizza special. I'll be back more times to come when I visit Chicago.",6,2,positive

I'm a stuff pizza kinda girl my goto place is Lou's but let me tell you this changed my world the crust is amazing just the way i like it brunt and crispy it's not as buttery as Lou's but it's amaze balls. I will def goo again and get a large deep dish instead of a personal size and re do the Hawaiian  pizza .

2395,"Pequod's was literally the first stop on our weekend Chicago trip and the absolute perfect way to kick it off. We came at the suggestion of a knowledgeable foodie friend who encouraged us to try an alternative to the tourist-y Giordano's and other larger brands. We arrived ~12pm on a Sat, and there was ample seating available. From reading reviews, I feared that it would take a long time for our pizzas to cook, but it took maybe 30 minutes max for the main features to arrive. We passed some of the wait time with the Pequod's salad--I thought it turned out to be amusingly like a pizza salad because it has cheese and pepperoni on it. We ordered two medium deep dish pizzas, one with pepperoni and onion, and one with spinach and mushroom, the latter I had a heavy hand in designing since those are the best veggies paired with ooey gooey cheese. I think I need to expand my vocabulary because ""yummy"" doesn't quite do the flavors justice. Pequod's signature caramelized cheese is a winner, especially if you like burn in a good toasty way. One interesting aspect of their pizzas is that the crust is more crunchy, or crouton-like rather than bread-like. While we chatted animatedly while waiting for the pies, we became quieter upon encountering their deliciousness firsthand and focusing our energies on gobbling slice after slice. Soon our party of five (including three guys with large appetites) were satiated, plus we had a slice leftover. Best of all, it was quite an inexpensive meal at ~$12 per person, considering we got a salad in addition to pizza and that we were in a big city, where I automatically assume everything is pricier. By the time we left the two floors of the restaurant were pretty full, so I believe Pequod's serves excellent true Chicago deep dish pizza more appealing to locals. The only problem with the experience is that now I crave Pequod's when I'm back at home. But I might just make the four hour drive to get it.",16,1,positive
2396,"This is Chicago best pizza...get the Pan Pizza, it's worth the wait.  Forget about Lou's, and Uno, and Giordano's... if you're coming to Chicago this is the place to check out.I've been coming here for years and it's always good. I've never been disappointed. Beer selection ranges from the basics to good enough number of premium options, although not many. The wine offerings are actually pretty decent given the ambience which emotes the expectation of Sutter Home or Beringer-only.While the decor could use some updating, I think keeping things the way they have been since the beginning gives the restaurant a certain classic charm. At first glance you think you're walking into a dive bar that's going to smell old and musty, but they keep things clean and fresh.Try a house or Pequod's salad as an appetizer too.Overall 5 stars for food, service ambience and overall experience with a True Chicago Pizzeria.",10,2,positive
2397,"Anton Ego from Ratatouille: ""If I don't love it, I don't swallow.""That was me with Chicago deep dish. At least until my last visit to the windy city. For Ego it was Remy's ratatouille. For me it was Pequod's.When Pequod's was first recommended by local friends, I hmmed and hawwed. They said ""no no, this ain't Uno's or Gino's East, this one packs a punch."" They mentioned the hour-long line of locals. Then they mentioned the caramelized cheese crust ring. Caramelized cheese crust ring?Pequod's delivered that punch. Pequod's delivered that hour-long line. It delivered rich sauce and flavorful crust with enough crunch at the bottom. Equally doughy, this pan pizza's crust is dense and puffy and way richer than regular deep dish, no stale airy dryness. The sausage is great, spicy and hearty. Pepperoni and onion hold up well. The cheese is there but expect less than other Chi pies. And then came that caramelized cheese crust. Everyone used a different method but we all had the same goal: JAM! IT! IN! And when we did, it was the end of Ratatouille for me.. 1st grade book-it pins and the TMNT arcade game's in the corner!""Not every Chicago place can cook great pie.

2403,I'm gonna give this place a 3 because their pizza was was just ok BUT I will need to think twice before returning.Went with a group of bad moms after catching the movie nearby. Service was awful---we did not get menus till about 15 minutes after we were seated and it took more than an hour and half to be served.  Our appetizers arrived with the pizza; the bottle of wine we ordered to accompany appetizers arrived warm and way after the pizza. Our soft drinks were never refilled since we saw our waitress twice: At time Of order and time Of payment.   Atmosphere was good but the bathrooms were scary.  Not only dirty and non-functional but very trashy looking.  We paid for parking.

I don't see any tables available."" Then she took us up stairs where there was a lot more seating. Ah. So there is room for a big party.Fast forward, I came back to visit again 9months later. This time we asked my girlfriend's local friends where they eat pizza. Three of us went on this visit. Three of us were not very pleased with the suggestion.

2406,"Pequod's was phenomenal from the start. We came here during lunch hour and despite the time of day we were able to be seated in 15 min. I'm a huge hockey fan, so I loved the primarily Blackhawks themed bar (among other sports) The waitress was satisfactory. Now as for the pizza.....lets start from the top. The prices here are reasonably priced if you share a pie with someone. You won't be breaking your wallet unlike some of the other deep dish restaurants in town. Unlike other deep dish pizza joints, Pequods toppings are actually on the top rather than deep under the sauce and/or cheese. This was great for my girlfriend who is a vegetarian since she was able to see what was on top of the pizza. In the past, we split pizza's and she would get a piece of pepperoni on her side which at times, unsettled her. However since we saw what was on top of the pizza, it made for a more pleasant experience. The sauce struck a perfect balance of being sweet with just enough tomatoey sourness, for a nice balance. Very hot. The cheese was decent mozzarella, nothing that stands out but FAR from bad. It was good. The toppings were also high quality and tasted as they should. Now for the crust....I think most people who visit Pequods know about their signature crust, and I must say its just aa delicious, crunchy, greasy, oily, salty, and tasty as it looks in pictures. SO GOOD. What the pictures show really are accurate for what you think it would taste like. This is a good winter pizza (though anytime is good) because it is doughy, but in a stomach warming hearty sort of way that fits cold weather. It's also a cold-weather pizza because it'd taste good with a pitcher of beer and Hawks game on tv. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in Chicago. Five stars.",23,7,positive

When the pizza came, I was very impressed by the size of the pizza and amount of cheese and topping that sat on top. The pizza was fresh and hot out of the oven. I remember watching in awe with the bubbling cheese and hearing the satisfying sizzling coming from the pan. The waitress sliced the pie and the rest is history.

2415,"-IMPORTANT NOTE: avoid the temptation to order an appetizer to fill the 45 minute cook time.  It's worth the anticipatory wait!! -  Amazing pizza, long waits (for a table and at the table), and one of the top pies in Chicago.  Not sure if it's a ""deep dish"" in the traditional sense, certainly not ""stuffed"" (though you will be), maybe more of a ""pan pizza"" on steroids.  The edge of the crust is magically caramelized, which is awesome on the first piece, from there it loses its structure.  Massive amounts of toppings.  Seriously, you need to try this place.",3,1,positive
2416,"Yes, the wait can be insanely long, between getting seated and then the pizza actually arriving. But basically any deep dish pizza takes awhile (45 mins at least) so that's to be expected.

They bought the bar next door and you can get 10% off your Pequod's order with your bar receipt, so there's a perfect place to wait to be seated. Take advantage! The pizza itself is delicious. I love the carmelized crust; definitely sets Pequod's apart from the other Chicago pizza places.

Pequod's treated us to a twenty five minute fifteen minute wait. We walked in before the dinner rush with most tables empty, by the time we determined they didn't want our money, they had seated several two tops, three three tops, and the final straw, a four top which pushed two tables together that we could have occupied with our five people. Shame that they are so focused on being an institution instead of a restaurant.",4,0,negative
2420,"Thought the place was overall a 3 Star. The pizzas were good but not great. The best topping is the sausage and the pan pizza crust is really good. It was busy on a Tuesday night and the pizzas came out pretty quickly.  For wines, your option is red or white, so we got beer. Our server was helpful and gave pretty mediocre service.  If someone asked me for a pizza recommendation, this would NOT be the first on my list.",8,0,negative
2421,"I wouldn't call myself a deep dish connoisseur or anything but I do like myself a good pizza now and again while in town. I ordered a large which was big enough to feed a small army and it was pepperoni and sausage. Sausage tasted kind of gross and like an unflavored meatball, along with the pizza having wayyyy too much sauce. I got a Caesar salad and it was just below average. I did like the cheese crunchies on the crust, but it wasn't worth $43.",6,1,negative

2424,This place is a bit of a trek from downtown Chicago but it is totally worth it! This was our first stop in Chicago and we were not disappointed by their deep dish pizza. We got the special which includes a pint of beer and a personal sized deep dish pizza for $4.95.Note: The personal sized pizza is enough for 2 people.Hands down the best bang for your buck.,3,1,positive
2425,"Pizza at Pequod's was definitely worth the try. Recommended by a coworker as the best deep dish in Chicago I had to give this one a go. Ordered the deep dish with sausage and the thin dish with my typical, veggie, four seasons-delight style (mushroom, onions, green peppers, and olives). The deep dish was definitely unique and a great crunch to it, which is something that you don't get normally with deep dishes. I felt that the pizza tasted very fresh and the ingredients were easily distinguishable with every bite.  The thin dish was not as delicious and resembled more of pan pizza that I normally would get down at the south side.  The overall atmosphere resembles more of a typical pizza joint and the staff were on-and-off friendly. I guess that the overall restaurant feel had me at dismay for a portion of my dining experience.My favorite deep-dish of all time is Uno's, and I felt that Pequod's did not meet my expectations. The feel, the case-iron pan, the pizza taste added to the okay it's-pizza experience. Maybe the place was overly-hyped and I had high expectations coming in. My tastes do differ than others, so others may think that this place is a 5-star.  Overall, Pequod's offer a unique deep dish that is only found at this place. Another plus is the amount of customization that they offer for your pizza.  I would definitely recommend this place to other local Chicagoans in the future, but also note that reservations should be taken, since the place fills up quick (two floors). And lastly, if you are feeling extra EMO, I will probably recommend take-out.",9,1,negative

2429,"Pequod's is great Chicago pizza.  Tasty pizza with seemingly fresh ingredients.  Lively, fun atmosphere.  Attentive, friendly service.  It is more of a pan pizza though than full-out deep dish.  Really the only drawback is the wait for a table. I wouldn't suggest sitting at the bar because that area gets so crazily packed, it's like a Wal-Mart on Black Friday. People are throwing 'bows and jostling for position like there's no tomorrow.  But if you come prepared to wait for a table, there's no worries.Bottom line, Pequod's is amazing. If you live in the area, this should be a regular haunt. If you're visiting, it's a nice alternative change-up to the bigger deep dish players.",8,3,positive

I thought the crowd was due to it being the weekend of the Chicago marathon, but my friend said its always pretty crowded. We were a group of 6 but we were seated right away with reservations. The burnt crust was really good to me, but my sister was not a fan. My boyfriend also said the pizza was too heavy for him and he had major food coma afterwards.Overall, I would say its delicious :) I would come back if I am ever back in Chicago.",5,1,positive

2432,"My 3/5 star rating is for a combination of two visits to Pequods.1st time: Awful. A friend from out of town wanted to come here and I was excited because of all the great things I've heard. I didn't think the service or pizza were great by any means.  Later learned the pizza that was ordered was vegan. No wonder! Waitress was cranky but maybe she was having a bad day.2nd time: Awesome. The same friend came in and wanted to go back. After vowing to myself I would never go back, here I was again. This time the pizza was great and the service was great.  Glad I gave it another shot. The toppings we got were spinach, sausage, tomatoes, and garlic on one pizza and mushrooms, onion, spinach, basil, garlic on the other. I would recommend both!",7,2,negative
2433,"Deep thoughts are better but is deep pizza dish really better? Alas may be ill equipped or unwilling to submit my answer to this, but Pequod's really helps promote the case for deep-dish. Walk in and it is what one expects a bar, booth tables and a bit dim so one could try to pass it as romantic. Deep dish pizza's come in Small Medium and Large. A Large cheese starts at 15.99 and toppings are a bit steep at $2.50 each. After a decent wait it came, caramelized cheese at the ends, sauce on top and laden with cheese and toppings. What impressed me was the use of spinach as a moisture barrier between the crust and the sauce and cheese. However the sauce was a bit bland, luckily the red pepper, oregano and cheese on the table helped remedy this issue. Garlic powder would have been nice. Overall for Chi town pizza this is my choice.",9,4,positive

2441,"Pequod's is a Chicago staple, no doubt, however, nothing is worth the terrible experience we had the last time we dined (or didn't dine) there. Our family timed our trip to Pequod's extremely conservatively arriving at 5:00 knowing we had a 7:10 movie to see. We had already taken advantage of their priority seating service. Upon arriving we were told we could sit immediately, and as we proceeded to the table --- oh no. Just kidding.--- they decided to give our table to another family who needed a high chair, so then we continued to wait. We got seated at 5:10 and ordered two thin crust pizzas immediately due to the 60 minute wait time on pizzas they advertised at the front desk. We put in beverage orders and waited quite a while for them to come to the table, but seeing as how crowded the restaurant was, that didn't bother us. 60 minutes in to our wait time- waitress is no where to be found, table next to us had decided to leave because they had been waiting longer than they deemed appropriate for their food. 70 minutes into our wait time- still no food. Waitress arrives and alerted us it would take 10 more minutes.  We start our stop watch 80 minutes into our wait time- ""just a little longer guys."" Stressed our waitress. At 6:55 pm our waitress comes by with to-go boxes, knowing we had a movie to catch, and said we still needed to wait on the pizza. At that point, we paid for our drinks, and in a last minute attempt to eat dinner opted for potbellys sandwiches next door. We know this wasn't the waitress' fault. She already lost two tables that night and I felt for her. Dear Pequod's, Chicago is known for their pizza. I can think of several places that we could have gone and had a delicious pizza. If you want to stay competitive, I would suggest another way of functioning, because making people wait 1:45 minutes for a pizza is absurd. On top of that, we were sat right by the door, and your crowd control needs attention as well. I had the elbows of patrons on my chair as I'm trying to sit and converse with my family. I am extremely disappointed in my experience at your restaurant, and would feel terrible if I recommended this experience to anyone.",9,8,negative

Sadly what i recieved after an hour wait was equivalent to a greasy crouton with a thin flavorless layer of tomato sauce and an even thinner layer of cheese. If i had been blindfolded and fed this, I'd assume it was an overcooked breadstick. Honestly I've had better pizza from Domino's.

Pepperoni and sausage is Brackin!!! Eat up its delicious and yummy. Really great for Netflix and food coma.",6,1,positive
2447,"Okay, I'm one of the biggest pizza fans I know. I don't discriminate against crusts, I love all types, despite the people that love to hate on the Chicago deep dish. So when my sister suggested Pequod's I was ready to go. I heard the wait was pretty long, but we went at 5 and we had no wait. Our party of 5 was put in a pretty tiny half-circle booth, that was my main complaint, we barely had any elbow room. However, this place is pretty good. The crust is the best part in my opinion, it's basically coated with this baked, crispy, caramelized cheese, which I adore. The sauce was really good as well, though I think slightly more bland than some of the Chicago-style competitors. Overall, I really enjoyed this place. The service was great, the pizza was great, though I'm torn over whether it gets best Chicago-style for me. You have to give it a try though, if not for the crust alone!",16,4,positive

The 15 minute wait turned out to be more than 45 minutes - it seems the standard reply at mid-afternoon was ""15 minutes"" and at least one group next to us said they had been waiting more than an hour after being told that. Once seated, we got everything we asked for, refills etc. But the food took a while. So it's definitely not somewhere you're going to go in for a quick bite.

We figured we would give it a try and get it delivered to our hotel. Horrible idea! We placed the order at 11:25 pm. We ordered a meatball sandwich, half order of wings, mozzarella sticks, fries, and a slice of cake The food didn't arrive until almost 1:00 am. Here is the worst part, they completely forgot the meatball sandwich! No sandwich at all. We called back and we were offered a ""partial refund"" not even sure for how much yet as the refund hasn't went through on my credit card just yet. We were then told the meatball sub would be right out. It didn't arrive until 2:00 am and we had to get up at 7:00 am the next morning. In the meantime waiting we tried the rest of the food. The mozzarella sticks obviously sat for quite awhile. The fries were extremely soggy and just barely cooked. The cake had a very odd refrigerator smell to it. The only thing decent enough were the wings, but you don't get much of them.  When the meatball sub arrived the delivery guy offered us a free pineapple and jalapeño pizza because ""he couldn't deliver it"". We didn't want it but just said okay with no real intentions of eating it. We opened it up just to see and as I predicted the pizza was burnt! Basically their apology was a burnt pizza someone else didn't want. $38 for some of the worst food I have ever eaten. Absolutely horrible! I would never eat from them again even if the food was free. Just disgusting. They should of refunded the entire order. The free burnt pizza was really offensive and only annoyed me further. The worst service ever!!!Edit: I got my refund today. Only $9.16 which I guess was for the meatball sub. The way the woman over the phone made it sound was that I would be at least getting half the order refunded for their mistake. Oh well. Cheap company that I would never order from again. If you want burnt pizza and bad customer service eat here!",12,8,negative

After tip, it almost came out to $40, and what a waste of $40 that was. I love the caramelized cheese on the crust and the sweet sauce, but the bread on the pizza wasn't good. It lacked seasoning and didn't taste like anything. It wasn't buttery, it wasn't salty, it wasn't... anything. In my boyfriend's words, it's like they stacked a whole bunch of tortillas on top of each other and then created a pizza with it. Maybe Pequod's isn't good for delivery.

Well, my boyfriend lived in Chicago for a year and swore up and down that Pequod's was the best. So, being the good partner I am, I took his word for it.  And, he was right-- Pequod's did not fail me... it was awesome!

2486,BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago! The marinara sauce is extremely flavorful and tastes fresh! Place is loud and a bit dingy and service is REALLY slow which cuts off major points from the review but the pizza is worth going for again and again!,2,1,negative
2487,"I disliked everything about this place and probably more so because everyone I talked to mentioned how amazing this place was. Our server was a young college kid (like everyone else here) that must've forgotten she was waiting tables because she sat and talked another group of people for 15mins before she took our order. My beer came late and warm and my water was never filled.I don't eat meat, my other two dining mates do, and we each wanted something different from the menu, so we went with personal sizes. First, the prices are offensive. Second, I hate minced garlic from a jar and when I asked if they freshly mince or use it out of a jar, our server rolled her eyes at me and said she didn't know. I never found out the truth because she never offered to find out for us.Look at my burnt pizza: yelp.com/user_local_phot…It was super dry and the red sauce was too tart.",4,2,negative
2488,"This place was an outstanding deep-dish pizza place that scored well all round.It's a neat old place that has character and thankfully plenty of room since it has upstairs and downstairs.  The deep dish pizza was outstanding, hot with a crispy crust, lots of flavour, cheese, sauce, etc., and the crust was rather caramelized on the edge.  Salads and appetizers were good.  Mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini were great, too.  Pasta (ordered for the one kid who does not like pizza) was good.  Beer selection had some great beers on it but unfortunately lacked darker/red/amber beers that I find to be best with pizza.  Service was great.",12,2,positive
2489,"Amazing Chicago style pan pizza!! Perfect cheese, perfect sauce, cooked just right. I wanted to keep eating more but I was so full, couldn't even finish the small size. A little far out of the downtown area but worth it to avoid the chains",3,0,positive
2490,"Loved the pizza here! The burnt cheese edges make the pizza. I'm not a huge fan of a ""burnt"" taste, but this is more like caramelized. Loved both the sausage pizza (looked homemade) and the cheese. It does take quite a while for them to make it (one hour for us) but we just called ahead and picked it up. So happy we followed the advice of our friend from Chicago!",2,0,positive
2491,"Unique spin on deep dish. As others have said, it's true the crust is thicker than some other interpretations, but it is fresh, soft and very chewy. I can understand why some feel cheated that they're paying so much for what is essentially focaccia bread, but it has great texture. I think you get plenty of food for the money, so I don't get complaints about price; a large slice (essentially one serving) probably comes in at between three and four dollars and is definitely a meal's worth. Two slices and you'll be stuffed for the rest of the day. Three slices and you'd better be ready to commit to a food coma.On the plus side, they pile the cheese and sauce all the way to the edge and there's barely any sort of crust handle, so that thick bottom is offset by the fact that there isn't much crust at the outside edge of the slice.The trademark ""caramelized"" crust is really more of a char, giving it a nice smoky flavor like something that came off the grille, a pretty distinctive signature that sets them apart and adds a nice finishing touch to the slice.The sauce tends toward sweet as opposed to savory, however their toppings leave just a bit to be desired. I'm a sucker for Italian sausage, but their sausage seems pretty tame to me. Honestly reminded me more of Italian meatballs and despite the fact it has fennel in it, it doesn't seem to have that distinctive punch I'm used to in authentic Italian sausage. I think it needs a little more zip.You can't go wrong here and I would never turn down Pequod's, but the overall flavor profile just seems a bit simple in contrast to some others I've had. That isn't a dealbreaker, but if you're looking for a more complex mingling of flavors in your tomato pie, there are certainly other options around town. If they amped up the flavors in their sauce and toppings just slightly to give it a little more pizzazz, I'd probably give them a solid five stars.",16,6,positive
2492,"I don't get the love for this place. Our pizzas lacked flavor, were terribly under-seasoned, and required a large portion of the dried Parmesan found on the table next to ours. The sauce is basically tomato sauce, which also isn't seasoned. The dough with the cheese on the side just tastes like burnt nothing. I don't understand how this is the ""best"" deep dish in Chicago?! They could honestly learn something from Little freakin' Caesar's about how to do burnt cheese crust. That's how average I find their pizza.",4,1,negative

2494,"First, let me say I'm going to try this place again and eat there. We got delivery today, one pan pizza and one thin. The meatball on the pan was disappointing too thinly sliced and overcooked, dried out. Not at all worth the premium price for this topping especially since there was so little of it. The caramelized crust was delicious, but there was way too much sauce for my taste. The thin crust was a soggy mess. It wasn't very thin. It wasn't crisp or chewy. Just wet, maybe just doesn't deliver well. The Italian sausage on the thin crust was actually bad - no flavor and a mushy texture. It didn't taste like Italian sausage at all. The staff on the phone and the delivery guy were so nice. Hoping it was a fluke and they were having an off day.",6,2,negative
2495,"Only 5 years in Chicago and I had not heard of this place. Upon arriving early for a movie (across the street), we decided to give it a try. Thought it was just a little pub that had pizza.It's much larger than it appears (multiple levels). While walking to our table, we notice that every single table had deep dish (normally not a fan), so, we chose to fall in line. WOWWWW. Holy cow. Do not miss this pizza. Insanely good.",1,1,positive
2496,"I wish I could have negative stars. So disappointed that my friends visiting Chicago had to suffer the disappointment of this place. In short, service and food were so terrible. The two pizzas took an hour and a half to get onto our table. Appetizers took were spaced thirty minutes between each other.If we got her attention, the waitress forgot waters, drinks and extra place settings multiple times. She was nice but just not attentive..In the span of an hour, they messed up my salad three times? All I asked for was no dairy/gluten and even offered to just take it off myself. They insisted and came back all diff variations of cheese and crouton mixes.. In the end, we cancelled it because people were done eating.Management seemed so exasperated and talked about how they messed up our table right next to us?Above all, the pizza was terrible and bland. As hungry as we were, just couldn't stomach that crust they're famous for. It was foamy and bland. Little chunks of caramelized flavor but not enough to offset the rest.We waited to talk with management, but they were so busy and not to be seen.Currently at protein bar cuz im so hungry.",4,8,negative

2498,"Was staying at the dana hotel on a business trip, which happened to be within the delivery zone of this number-one-friend-recommended deep dish pizza place in Chicago. Fortunately, I remembered that deep dish takes MUCH longer than the quick-fires that I'm used to, so I ordered about an hour ahead, which was perfect because, with delivery, it took 1 hr 10 min. WORTH IT!! I ordered the personal size (7"") with meatballs, mushrooms, and pineapple (toppings are charged per, btw), and man was it delicious!! Their cheese and toppings are so yummy, and that caramelized crust is omgtodiefor. I are the whole thing. It's probably enough for two people of my size (5'6"" 125 lbs) to eat, but there was just no way I wasn't going to down every bite of that scrumptiousness.

2499,"We have been to many pizza places in Chicago. This is by far the best of the best. It's the crispy, cheesy crust that makes this pizza so unique. Every time we visit, we order a large to go, and freeze when we get home. Heats up very well.",3,2,positive
2500,"After craving this pizza joint what seemed like forever, I finally had the chance to order for delivery. The deep dish pie primarily consists of bread, which took forever to chew and swallow.

They're famous for their ""caramelized cheese crust"" and for good reason- it was amazing. They have an awesome lunch deal- for $5 you get a fountain drink and a personal sized cheese pizza (you can add extra toppings for an extra charge, but they recommend sticking with cheese only for the best flavor). I got half cheese and half sausage. The sausage was great but I actually enjoyed the cheese half the bestOf note: the pizza takes a solid 30-45 minutes to come out, so don't come here if you're in a hurry",9,1,positive
2505,Second favorite pizza in the city (Lou's is #1) but is very close to the best.  The downfall for me is that there aren't many peaquods and its a haul from the south loop.  Their crust is amazing and I'm a big fan of their sauce.  Prices are extremely reasonable.,4,1,positive
2506,"For my money, this is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.The sauce and caramelized crust set it apart from the stiff competition in town. Also, definitely get the sausage!As good as the pizza is, it is a bit bready compared to other options around town. I'm totally fine with that, but if that's not your thing, take note. Also, their salads and appetizers are not at the same level as Lou Malnati's and Giordanos. But I like the pizza better - it just barely beats Lou's in my book - which is why you come here anyways.Pro tip - THE LUNCH SPECIAL.",5,1,positive

2513,"We went on a Friday night and this place was SUPER packed. The doorbell from people leaving and entering was literally going off every minute or so -- that's how popular this place is! The wait wasn't too long though,  we waited for 30 minutes to get a seat. We got a medium deep dish with spinach on the whole pizza, pepperoni on one half and sausage on the other. We've tried our fair share of deep dish pizzas and this one was quite delicious. And the crust is amazing! Price-wise, it's interesting because all their default pizzas are only cheese and you have to pay ~$2 for each topping. So it's cheaper if you only get cheese, but if you end up getting toppings like us, it comes out to about the same as other deep dish pizza places.",7,0,positive

2515,"When a friend of mine mentioned Pequod's as her favorite deep dish in Chicago, my curiosity was definitely piqued.I'm here all night, folks.Eating at Pequod's is a great experience.  The place is just an unassuming bar with a good amount of TVs to just hang out and wait for a delicious pizza to be brought to your table, served right in the pan, no less.Not gonna lie, I miss early 90's Pizza Hut so bad.The service is attentive; two of us at the table were having coffee for lunch (it was a long night) and they kept the pot filled for basically just the two of us.  So onto the pizza.  We got a sausage/mushroom/spinach pizza and a meatball/peppers pizza.  You got big hunky pieces of topping with a yummy sauce and a nice crisp crust to go with it.  Our two pies varied pretty greatly in crust thickness, but either way, both were great.  The biggest negative, however, is that they fall into the trap of soggy veges.  If you have too many veges in your pie, it's just leaving a ton of moisture on there leaving everything a slippery mess and even worse when reheating it.  There are definitely a couple different things they could do to avoid this, like chopping them into smaller pieces, ensuring that they're on the top to let moisture escape, using a salad spinner after chopping, etc.We had some leftovers and because of said sogginess a lot of that cheese just oozed off, which is unfortunate.  Also, the crust got pretty saturated too, so even with a pizza stone, the dough was still pretty soggy.So yeah, for now I would say avoid having too many veges on your pie and avoid taking it home.  It's just not a very good experience.However, despite all of that, I might like this better than the big three...",17,5,positive

2523,"I have just found my new favorite Chicago-style pizza place. The winner goes to Pequod's Pizzeria.This place has the most variety in terms of appetizer selections. I believe appetizers are important for deep dish pizza-serving restaurants largely due to the expectation that these pizzas take longer to make than thin crust ones. In addition, the Pequod's salad is pretty decent (the creamy garlic sauce is clutch). As for the pizza itself, I was astonished. The crust, including the bottom, was crispy and solid. This is difficult to come by. I've always experienced softer/soggier bottom crusts due the way that deep dish pizzas are made in general. In addition, I'm a huge fan of their sausage topping. I definitely think they use a better grade of sausage than other pizza places. The most impressive thing I noticed at Pequod's is the relatively short amount of time it takes to bake the pizzas. I daresay it was the fastest I've seen a Chicago-style deep dish pizza come out. Service is great, the pizza is superior, and prices are relatively cheaper than those at similar restaurants. I haven't taken advantage of this special yet, but if you dine in for lunch (Mon-Fri 11AM-3PM) at Pequod's, you can get a 7"" pan pizza with a soda or beer for $4.95.",15,1,positive
2524,"We often go to Pequod's with another couple prior to going to see a movie at the Webster 11 across the street.  This is one of our favorite pies in the city.The Good:The pizza.  Both the deep dish and the thin crust are exemplary.  The other item we really enjoy are the Jalapeno Poppers; they are filled with cheddar cheese instead of the typical cream cheese and it makes for a very delicious appetizer.  I would encourage anyone to try the sampler as well.  This place also has some great beer selections; I'm personally a big fan of the Half Acre Lead Feather.The Bad:Occasionally they will overcook the pizza, usually the pan.  A couple times I've had mine come out with a burnt bottom, which doesn't ruin the meal but is rather disappointing.Also, if you order a Pan Pizza it will take over an hour... not necessarily a bad thing but definitely something to keep in mind.The Ugly:Make sure you call ahead for seating, the host stand is a hot nightmare.  Everything is done old school with pen and paper and everything is very disorganized.  My wife and I once had to eat at the bar because we had been told we had an hour and a half wait after having waited for an hour and a half already (I think the host got his sheets of paper out of order and was seating people who had just showed up while we continued to wait).  I understand it's not easy to deal with a restaurant when it is as small as Pequod's and gets as busy as Pequod's does, but the people at the host stand are often overwhelmed and nowhere near up to the task.That said, this place is a Chicago staple for a reason, and a definite must-eat for anyone trying to sample the city's best pizza.",10,3,positive

To be honest, the crunchy burnt cheese or whatever it is on the crust was gross. In addition, the pizza had no taste. My boyfriend said the leftovers were disgusting. The Caesar salad was also weird; I've never had one with mixed greens before. It honestly seemed like a house salad with Caesar dressing but I guess that's how they do it. The Chicago location is a dump, one of the dirtiest establishments I've ever been in. I sat down and had sauce on my shirt and a dirty mushroom on my leg cause the table was dirty.

They have a fair selection of pizzas but since 5 people couldn't agree on any 2 toppings, we decided to go with personal one. I had the mushroom and meatball. I thought it was pretty good, for Chicago pizza. Doesn't compare to the pizza parlor i eat at, at home. Where the guy is from Italy with a heavy accent but i still liked it. Also if they ask you for appetizers because it take 5 minutes to make, you heard them wrong. It takes 35 minutes to make. Our waitress said it right but we just didn't hear it. Get an app if your hungry. While i prefer my normal pizza to deep dish, if you have never had it, Pequod's is an awesome place to go.

All the hoopla over this place how and why would they serve a burnt pizza right? Ordered a deep dish sausage also. It looked burnt but was told by the waitress it was suppose to look like that. I only asked because the waitress was wrapping our thin crust for us to take home and pointed out to us our thin crust was burnt. lol lol lol lol. She adjusted our bill. I don't understand the appeal of this place. Sausage tasted like allspice. Not a fan. As far as the staff at the door they are not welcoming and really lack any hustle. They seated us pretty fast but I had to ask for a server after ten minutes.  We arrived at 4:30 on a sunday afternoon.

The sauce is so rich in flavor, the sausage is homemade to perfection, and the crust is crispy at the bottom while the insides are cooked just right. Because it takes a long time to cook (30-40 min.) give them your pizza order as soon as you can. Their onion rings are out of this world but the Pequod house salad is unremarkable.

2550,"This place has the feeling of a typical neighborhood trendy bar. Nice enough, nothing surprising, nothing bad. When I went with my friends it was packed to the point we had to wait 2 hours to be seated.... despite some ""reserved"" seats being available for nearly 90 minutes while we were standing around waiting. I can't really blame the establishment for holding a reserved table, I guess, but maybe I feel like I want to.More importantly, the pizza is not really deep dish. I guess I would describe it as a regular pan pizza with extra sauce. It wasn't rich and hearty like Giordano's and wasn't loaded with fixings either. It was just a thicker pan pizza.I got nothing to hate here, really. Just nothing to rave about either.",6,4,negative
2551,"Saw this of the food network and made it one of my must go to places when I visited Chicago. Waited 50 mins for medium deep dish pie which was perfectly fine with me and it was worth the wait. This pie is beautiful and a work of art. Oh yeah, it Tate's good too. Love the cheesy crust. It is also really good while cold for breakfast since this pie a huge even for 2 people.",7,2,positive

2553,Best Chicago style pizza! Skip all of the other touristy places and head up to Pequod's. They have the best lunch deal! For less than $5 you can get a personal cheese deep dish and a drink. Don't miss this!You know this a good place when Chicago PD is eating there.,2,0,positive

Luckily across the street this wonderful book bar just opened a few months ago called The Kibbitznest and we were able to have a nice drink there while we waited with our clicker. We even got a discount on beer and wine because we had a clicker!! It was fantastic! The bar tenders at the Kibbitznest held onto our clicker while we explored the beautiful place and came to get us when it buzzed to eat our favorite pizza!!! Couldn't have asked for a better night that began at the Kibbitznest and ended at Pequods!",10,0,positive
2556,"Initially I was planning on going to another pizzeria, but everyone in the office (ALL FROM CHICAGO) began telling me about this place... Truly the best pizza I've tried in Chicago.  A solid #2 overall.  I'm sure there's enough people telling you about the details, but if you're going for pizza in Chicago, skip the tourist attractions, go for this place and get the pan pizza.",3,0,positive
2557,"Best pizza in Chicago hands down. Crust is perfect, toppings are great and they use real tomatoes instead of some canned sauce for toppings. Absolutely delicious.",3,0,positive
2558,"Came here today for lunch and had a personal pizza with pepperoni and sausage. As someone who makes their own pizza from scratch several times a week, I thought this pizza was ok. The toppings were very fresh and the wait time wasn't as long as lou malnati's.  If you are used to your large chain restaurant pizzas such as pappa johns and pizza hut you will probably think this pizza tastes amazing.",2,1,negative
2559,"Been here a few times and love the place. This offers something a little different to Lou's. The atmosphere, the drinks and the sports bar feeling. This place can fill up quickly on weekends and get a little noisy but its worth the wait.I'm torn between Lou and Pequod's as to my favorite all time Pizza. However, I do love the rustic pans, caramelized base and crust. Service is with a smile. This place is dang cheap and services great food",6,1,positive
2560,"I eat A LOT of pizza.  In my world, there is no such thing as bad pizza.  Hands down, this is the best pizza I have ever put into my body.  And there has been a lot of pizza in this body.I had it 11 hours ago, and I'm considering a trip up there for lunch.",1,1,positive
2561,"Food: Love, love, love this place! This is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago and I don't care if I have to wait for it. Love the crunchy cheesy crust and the sauce is amazing! Try the meatball, pepperoni and green pepper combo. Yummmmm! Oh but I tried the salad once and it was just okay but hey, you come here for the pizza right?Service: Always on point! The waitresses are cheerful and fast. That's saying a lot considering how busy and how tightly packed it is on the first floor.My husband and I have decided that Pequod's will be our last meal should we ever move away from Chicago.",7,1,positive
2562,"Wow, expected a lot!!!  Actually just expected people to get my order right.  Sent me the wrong pizza after waiting an hour and a half for delivery.The wings tasted terrible and had weird texture.  Skip them!The garlic bread was over buttered and over seasoned, couldn't even finish them!Honestly, the pizza was good, but how do they get the order completely wrong? Luckily I wasn't allergic to green olives because they added those.** Asked for meat on one half.... they put it on the entire pizza.  My girlfriend is vegetarian.  She couldn't eat,  ruined her night.  Real upset I spent $35 on what I did not want.",3,7,negative
2563,"Awesome spot with great food and beer, as the wait times for a table during peak hours can attest. I've had both the thin crust and the deep dish pizza and both are amazing - although I'm a bigger fan of the deep dish pizza. The crust is perfectly crispy, thick, and buttery. Pequod's definitely doesn't skimp on toppings, either, so each bite of pizza is the perfect combination of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings. Definitely one of my favorite pizza joints here in Chicago. If you come without a reservation, don't let the long wait time turn you away - the pizza is definitely worth the wait!",6,0,positive
2564,I visited the Morton grove location which is the original and it is no comparison to the Clybourn location. It was still good but it was no match for Clybourn. The Clybourn location has more and bigger toppings and even the cheese is cheesier. This will always be my favorite pizza place.,2,0,positive
2565,My family and I stumbled upon this great pizza place by accident. My dad and I signed up for a 5 mile race down town and had to pick up our packet at Running Away Multisport that is a few doors down. Being from the suburbs we were unfamiliar with the area and decided to walk down the street to find something to eat for dinner. As we walked past Pequod's the smell of their great pizza literally stopped us in our tracks. The Pizza smelled so good we did not look any farther and went in.When we walked in the place was very busy and we were greeted by the hostess who informed us that we would have a fairly long wait ahead of us. It was a Friday night so we expected a wait. She said if we would like we could wait at the bar area. The bartender took our orders and told us that if we like we could look at a menu and place our order ahead of time or wait till we go to our table. We opted to wait till we got to our table and they had no problem with that. For being as busy as they seemed I expect to be rushed but this was not the case. Restaurants make money through a high turn over but our waitress didn't mind letting us take our time to enjoy the experience.Since this first experience we have braved the weather and Chicago traffic from the suburbs several times to go back for their awesome pizza. If you are in the area and looking for some deep dish pizza with crust you probably haven't had before (caramelized) give Pequod's a try.,8,4,positive
2566,"I was new in town this past weekend trying to compare NY style to Chicago style. Went to 4 different places, the names everyone mention, and was not impressed. A cashier from the Laguanitas Brewery on W 17th St really recommended this place. The last night I was in town I had to give deep dish another try before knocking it and I have to say this is the absolute best deep dish I could find.",3,0,positive
2567,"Great deep dish pizza for a steal. Service was good, pizza (pepperoni) was tasty, and there wasn't much of a wait (granted we did get there kind of early for a Friday night). Their pizza is a bit more doughy than cheesy, so although we did feel like fat kids afterwards we weren't in a food coma as can sometimes happen. Definitely would come back.",2,3,positive
2568,"In my humble opinion, best pizza in town. Not going to get into the debate on deep dish vs. pan vs. whatever-the-fuck but have a couple slices of this and tell me that crust isn't the standard bearer for deliciousness. Fun, noisy atmosphere. Great for a bite before the movie or with a group for a birthday. Grab a cocktail at Drinking Bird while you wait!",2,0,positive
2569,"I am not a huge fan of deep dish BUT I am a huge fan of Pequod's deep dish!!! That has to mean something right?! Don't get sucked into the hype with Lou Malnati's because Pequod's is significantly tastier, and it's so much more well made! I never thought I'd see the day when I would be craving deep dish. :) Thank you so much Pequod's!!",2,2,positive
2570,"The carmelized deep dish pizza here is second to none in the Second City! Great for take out if you live nearby and keep the pizza hot and ready for eating! So many different toppings to create mouth-watering pizzas. I particularly like having pineapple with bacon on mine.The location in Morton Grove is great and very handy for north suburban residents off of I-94. It is located in a charming little woodsy building that is intimate and fun. If you haven't tasted Pequod's, check it out. It is a top-notch Chicago deep-dish pizza experience.",9,0,positive
2571,"Maybe we went on an off night, but I wasn't really feeling Pequod.  Here are my thoughts:1.  Not really a deep dish pizza, but more of a pan pizza.   Think thick crust like Pizza Hut.2.  Tomato sauce, pepperoni, cheese and sausage were good and of high quality.3.  Sauce to cheese ratio was completely lacking.  There were sections when I honestly could not find ANY cheese.I left the meal feeling pretty underwhelmed.  Paying $30+ to eat thick bread with a smear of tomato sauce, cheese, and 2 pieces of sausage per slice.  Again, maybe we went on an off night, considering all of the other great reviews.",4,1,negative
2572,"They have thin and thick crust and a range of apps, so there's something for everyone (who's not a vegan or health nut, I'd say). The thick crust was good, probably as good as any I've had. It took a good while to come. The restaurant feels like a local place. It's a bit dark inside. The staff is friendly, although not super attentive.",7,1,positive
2573,"Oh, Pequod's. I travel to Chicago quite a bit, and each time I need to either make a stop here or have them deliver, that's how obsessed I am (and I've had them all-- Giordano's, Malnati's, Uno's, Pizanos)!In a nutshell, it's the best deep dish you'll find in the city-- the blackened crust is amazing, and the fillings are always incredible. The pizza is always on point, but their delivery service is something that lives much to be desired; the couple of times I ordered it delivered, they delivered it without pre-slicing it, and even though I requested paper plates and napkins and they said they would bring them, the driver never brought them with our order (something that made eating the pizza a bit of a challenge).Also, be wary of asking them to deliver to hotel rooms-- the last driver we had called repeatedly to complain about having to deliver to the room and asked us to meet him down the street. An hour of phone tag later and we finally got our pizza. Dude, next time just park in front of the hotel!!Five stars for the food, two and a half for delivery.",3,2,positive
2574,"As a lover of Chicago pizza, I was anxious to try Pequod's deep dish with caramelized crust.  The pizza has a copious amount of rich sauce with a thin layer of cheese and large chunks of meat.  All of the ingredients made this one of the freshest pizzas I've had in Chicago.  Clearly they don't skimp out on the quality.  What proved to be disappointing for me, however, was how thick and chewy the dough is.  I understand the concept of deep dish but this was almost pure bread with a very very thin topping smothered in sauce.  Overall the pizza is fresh and high quality, but far from my favorite in Chicago and certainly not worth the hype.  Service wise, Pequod's deserves a full 5 stars for their attentive wait staff.",9,3,negative
2575,"Let me start by saying, I absolutely LOVE pizza. So, when I came to Chicago, I made it my mission to find the best. After several recommendations for the best pizza, we ended up at Pequod's off the late night. We were seated right away which was great because we were starving. I'm giving this place only  because of the wait.  Took about 15 minutes for our wings which is normal but an HOUR, maybe a lil more (no exaggeration) for my pizza.  Not sure if this is the norm but if so, don't go there starving because you'll have an attitude.My review of the pizza, ""a good regular"". Crust was great!  Sauce/flavor was lacking a bit. Guess I was expecting nothing short of heaven because of how long we waited to get our food.Do I HAVE to go back? No. Especially if I'm super duper hungry.",9,1,negative
2576,"Pequod's is consistently delicious!  When I moved to my condo, it took at least a year and a meeting in the elevator with the delivery driver to learn that Pequod's delivers to my building!  What a pleasant surprise! Delivery is speedy and hot!  The restaurant is a very nice little spot with an upstairs and comfortable seating.  Staff is always pleasant, even during high capacity times and it's always a pleasant experience.",9,0,positive
2577,"After hearing a lot about this place from friends, my wife and I decided to finally give it a try. And what do you know: it's now one of our favorite pizza spots. Located in a good area with lots of shopping and even a movie theater across the street, this place starts off great. You walk in, there is always a line up so you put your name down and stand with the crowd with a pager in your hand. In the mean time, you can order your pizza so that when it's time for you to be seated, the pizza won't be too long. Since this is a sports bar as well, it is very crowded but lively. Don't let the place fool you because there is another floor upstairs with lots of seating room. We sat upstairs both times that we visited. The appetizers are also fresh and tasty. But let's talk about the thick crust pizza: it's NOT like pizza UNO, like Giordano's, or any other deep dish pizza you might think of. This is in a class of its own. The deep dish pizza is covered with the toppings you want which is one thing I like to see...more toppings than cheese. As you bite into, or cut into the pizza, you notice that even though it is thick crust, it's not too soft or too hard or full of dough. Somehow, the thick crust isn't as dough-like as you would think and therefore, not as filling as you would think. It's perfect! The outer crust area on top has their special touch to it: it is burnt cheese all around the top which gives it more of a different flavor when added to the pizza takes the whole experience to another level. Overall: one of our favorite pizzas in Chicago. For a regular pizza outing, I would choose Pequod's over any other ""deep-dish"" Chicago pizza.",14,3,positive
2578,"It's our tradition, following a hard weekend at Renegade Craft Fair to hit up Pequod's for delicious pizza. It's always so delicious and worth the wait. This review is mainly about the service received. We sat down, party of 5, and requested waters right away - it was a long long day. Server comes back, no waters, takes our drink order (including mentioning waters again). Returns with beers, no waters. We ask one more time for water and she hears us as if we had never asked before.  5 waters are then brought to the table and the final one was dumped, ice bucket challenge style on my friends sitting on the end. They were shocked out of their mind.  I never heard her, but others said she said sorry at that time, but it was so much commotion that it didn't come across. She brought over napkins and then that was it. My poor soaking friends took it in great stride. We know accidents happen, we just wish there had been some sort of apology. Some remorse over the fact that they had to sit in the super A.C.'d upper level with a huge puddle at their feet and freeze as we waited for our pizza. Pizza arrived, delivered by someone one else and she lost control of the scalding pan and it slid on the table right towards my friend who received the brunt of the water. Thankfully the server caught it before it could burn the crap out of my friend, but seriously, the only torture we expect pizza waiting is from our grumbly stomachs, NOT the waitstaff. Again, TOTALLY get accidents happen. We have all been servers before, I just would have handled that situation so differently. I would have apologized more than once, I would have come back to see if we were comfortable, I would have offered to move us so we didn't have a puddle at our feet, and I would have talked to my manager to see if there was any sort of compensation that could be provided. That's basic customer service. We were all kind of appalled to see that not even the ice tea was comped. Perhaps it's entitlement, but I can't remember the last time I was at a restaurant and a mistake went unacknowledged like that. Now here was the hardest part. As check was delivered, and again, no apologies were ever made outside of the drop we had to contemplate tip. Some would say none, the service was terrible. Some would say the regular 20%, accidents happen. I kept going back and forth, again being a server... what if this was the worst day of your life and this happened to you.  But again, if it was me that would inspire me to take great care of a table and show them how sorry I was. I wound up tipping 12% .... and we are most likely taking our tradition somewhere else next time.",11,15,negative
2579,"My review might be colored by the fact that the pizza at Pequod's was the very first deep dish I'd had, but I absolutely loved it!I was in Chicago for the holidays, to visit friends, and someone suggested Pequod's for proximity reasons. Although I did get to have deep dish pizza again during my stay, and from a different place, there's no way I can compare that and Pequod's.How do you describe deep dish pizza? Let me just say that I understand why it's called a ""pie"" now. In fact, that's how I can best describe it - a very tomatoey, very cheesy, very meaty pie, with a hot, crisp crust!We went for a medium sausage pizza to be shared by 4, and underestimated how large and heavy it will be. It took 45-50 minutes to prepare, but two slices, and I was done!Don't get there when you're extremely hungry, because in all likelihood, there's gonna be a line when you get there, and then the wait for the pizza. But MAN the pizza is amazing!",5,1,positive

When we finally got the pizza, it just didn't taste as fresh as we had hoped, the sauce was basic and it smelled like Pizza Hut  maybe we set our expectations too high or maybe we should have gone here first before trying other pizzas. Not my first choice.",2,1,negative

2588,"Well. After recommending this place to everyone I know who visits my hometown, I'm thinking my endorsements may have been a mistake. I defend this place A LOT against warnings of insufferable service and bad crowd control. I am willing to cut them a lot of slack for their pizza. It is an attraction for which a bad personality is sometimes forgivable. And I've been coming long enough that I know better than to expect reliable service on a Saturday, or to attempt a table during the NBA playoffs. But on a Tuesday night, in the summer offseason with zero sports, you'd think the expectation of actually getting to eat the pizza you called in 20 minutes prior that was put in 'right away' is reasonable. Yeah?We order at 6:30. We get there after a cross-town trek. We think we're fine, since there's no wait when we called, and the order went in awhile ago. We go to check in amid largely vacant tables... and are told it'll be a 40 minute wait JUST to sit. What?Pequods, I get it. Your justification makes sense, it's just not very good. I work in customer service, and I know there's 'technically' no responsibility for you to update patrons (who already ordered and are headed to your restaurant) that an influx of HUGE parties has added 40 minutes to your previously nonexistent wait, but when you are bitchy about it on arrival, and act like it's unreasonable to be taken by surprise by this development, that's what stops fans from endorsing you. Did you have to call? No. If you had? You would've saved your loyal customers $20 in cab fare, a shitload of traffic, respect, and a wasted pizza. My life isn't your problem, I get that, but there's a courtesy in not springing this on a party for whom you've already told you're cooking food for. That's how you become a restaurant whose patron recommendations start carrying warnings.I've happily put up with the unpredictability on weekends or during sports events, but as a loyal recommender of this place, I'm really disappointed. I don't whine. I just want whoever monitors this to know that it's becoming a reputation people are listening to. Also, there were a ton of open tables given parties of 40 and 25 were supposedly occupying the bulk of the place, but given everything else I guess I'm not shocked we have a difference in logic. Pizza's the best in chicago if you can deal with the side of shit. Up to you.",19,11,negative

I've been here twice, hoping I'd understand why the lines are so long to get in, but I haven't.  I don't find the dough or sauce particularly tasty; the crust and sides tend to get burnt in the cooking process, which I think is their ""thang"" but there's not enough of it on the pizza to really enjoy it.

I opted to get a personal pan deep dish cheese only and the family got a medium pepperoni and sausage deep dish. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes or longer for your pizza to arrive.

There was a sign that pizzas were running 50 minutes. That is a long time. You might as well read Moby Dick while you wait for your pizza. Good thing I didn't have to be anywhere and I was with great companyWhen the pizza finally came out it looked and smelled delicous. It was definitey worth the wait. I was stuffed after 1 1/2 pieces. It was very heavy. I am a New Yorker and I know pizza. Deep dish isn't my favorite but Pequod's is the place to get deep dish in Chicago. I suggest ordering an appetizer while you wait.

2605,"What the? I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about.  SERIOUSLY.  I went here a couple of years ago and didn't like it,  but decided it give it a second chance tonight with my cousin from out of town. ..Holy overrated! First of all, our waitress was wack...I mean,  she could've just been having a bad day so whatever. Secondly, the menu is outdated and they really should invest in a drink menu or drink specials. The food?  No bueno. The burnt crust aka 'caramelized' crust on the 'deep dish' that everyone raves about was just awful. The pizza was bland and the sausage was gross. I mean, honestly I don't understand all of these elite reviews,  are we eating at the same place?! I love pizza, I really do & I guess you should give it a chance...I guess. Will I be going back?  Negative.",3,6,negative

We ordered the appetizer combo, everything tasted fresh. We also had a sausage and cheese thin crust pizza, it was really good. A few people in my party thought the sausage tasted weird or like it came from a box. I do not eat sausage so I wouldn't know. I would come back",5,1,positive
2607,"I have eaten at about 5 Chicago pizza places now and I must say that this is the best pizza in the city. Came here mainly because I have heard so much about it and I just had to give it a try. When you first walk in, it looks like a bar and grill with an upstairs, not to mention the small size menu. For starters, I went the buffalo wings, which were really really good. As for the pizza, I went with a sausage, pepperoni, and garlic. The pizza is simply greatness. The sausage is on point, they give you a lot of pepperoni and the garlic blends in greatly. The slices are big (got a medium with six slices for two but should of just got a small) and the addition of the legendary caramelized crust takes the pizza into a unseen stratosphere. Their beer (at $6 a glass) is even at a decent price. Overall the only pizza place I haven't ate at in Chicago is Lou malnati, but if it's anything like Pequod then lord help us all.",7,0,positive
2608,Too many excellent places for pizza in Chicago to waste time and money here. Have ordered twice from their take-out location at Chicago and Dearborn and both times they got the order wrong. Very expensive to boot. Employees seem clueless and preoccupied with their own cell phones when you arrive. Not sure it's smart to keep old credit card receipts by the take-out door either.,2,4,negative

2610,"Pizza preferences are usually based on where you're from, so let me start this by saying that I'm from Cincinnati. I like thick-ish pan pizzas with slightly tangy sauce and a chewy, stringy mozzerella topping. I like to eat pizza with my hands, and I like to eat more than one slice (lookin' at you, deep dish). Overall I like a balance of the sauce and cheese that, in my opinion, neither NY style nor Chicago style have a lock on (NY: too much cheese, Chicago: too much sauce). So Pequod's: great or the greatest?? Lemmie break it down for you: Sauce: Killer-diller. Not too sweet and not too tart.Cheese: Mozzerella--chewy and delicious. Weirded out initially by the cheese on the crust, but it gives the pizza a nice crunch at the end. Crust: Oh god so good--this is the mother-of-all pan pizza crusts. Thick, but solid and not incredibly doughy like Chicago deep dish. Crunchy and crusty at the bottom so that you can actually eat a slice with your hands without it bending down. Sauce-to-cheese ratio: Almost perfect! A little heavy on the sauce, but way closer to my ideal ratio than any other pizza joint in the area. Toppings: This is the only thing that threw me. The garlic topped pizza was fantastic, but the sausage on the sausage-topped pizza was too chewy for me--almost seemed over-cooked. Verdict: Sausage-less Pequod's is my true-heart's desire. I can't speak for the in-restaurant service, since I got it delivered. Pequod's pizza all day, every day, now and forever, amen.",16,1,positive

2613,"Decent.  Deep dish just doesn't seem to do it for me like thin crust does.  Way too much dough.  Was hoping there'd be a little less. I ordered the personal pizza with sausage and meatballs.  I did like how the cheese was burned into the crust.  The wait was a little longer than I would have liked...Someone came in after us, was seated after us, ordered a larger pizza, and got his first.  Overall decent but nothing blew me away.",4,1,negative

2619,"I suppose I should first share my thoughts on the other well known Chicago deep dish pizzas: Lou Malnati's - Super buttery, super greasy, and super cheesy. Immediate food coma following the meal. If you love all of the above then you'll love Lou's.Giordano's - Heavy on the sauce and cheese and the crust felt wet. So basically it's a pile of yummy mush in your mouth. That's not necessarily bad, but also not amazing. Pequod's is the perfect deep dish pizza. The ingredients are fresh. As in, the italian sausage is the best I've ever had and even the bell peppers still have a slight crunch. The crust isn't drenched in butter or grease and it has a light crunch. There's even a rim of burnt cheese around the top. (Don't make a face. Everyone loves burnt cheese.) Every person I have introduced to Pequod's has fallen in love. If you haven't already, go tonight. Also, the pizza is made to order so you should expect to wait 30 minutes for the pizza after you've placed your order. Staff has always been awesome and the atmosphere feels like you're hanging out with your best friends at a divey sports bar.",15,4,positive
2620,"Pequod's was my first Chicago deep dish pizza experience and it was awesome!  After waiting for the 40-minute cooking time, our pie finally arrived and not a moment too soon because I was starving after a long day of sight-seeing.  Our pizza came loaded with big chunks of sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, and copious amounts of stringy, molten mozzarella.  The thick crust had a beautifully caramelized, chewy ring of cheese surrounding the edge.  It was hands down the tastiest-looking pizza I have ever laid my eyes on.  With a whirl of knife and fork, I inhaled two delicious slices before hitting the food wall.  Deep dish pizza is deceivingly filling so if it's your first time having it, don't be surprised if you are full after two pieces.       I've since tried Jordano's deep dish and while very very good, I'd still say Pequod's is number one for me.  Lou M's is next on my list to try!",4,0,positive

2622,"Woman on the phone on Saturday night October 29 has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I called 4 times because each time I called it would ring and then just start beeping. If you answer a phone, you at the very least, tell the customer please hold, not just automatically put them on hold. On the fourth time I called, after sitting on hold for almost 5 minutes on the third time I called, she was just so rude. Don't be a hostess, or even a person dealing with customers in any manner, because just being kind can go a long way. I get that it's a Saturday night, and I get that it's a busy night, but if you are rude to people for no reason, you will not appreciate the way you are treated back. Pequods has pretty good pizza but every time I have dined in and done takeout/delivery, the service is just awful. I would've thought by now that after several online reviews, and I am sure in-person complaints, management would have taken steps toward improving the service.",4,4,negative
2623,Really bad service! I have never written a bad review before but this is ridiculous. Have been seated here for two hours and we ordered jalapeño poppers and a pan pizza. Of course the jalapeño poppers was so we could eat something while waiting. Our waitress forgot both!!! Once we asked her after an hour for the poppers she brought them then came back half an hour later to tell us she forgot to put our order in for the pizza!!! wtf!!! 2 hrs wasted! Really pissed off! Thank god she at least apologized. Hopefully the pizza is good. If yes maybe I will post another review.Ok so here is my next review:Okay so now after I have calmed down and I am done eating the pizza I must say that the pizza was really good especially the crust! Also I feel bad for the waitress now that it's been two days and maybe she did have a lot of people to serve. She is only human. I will change my review from 1 to a 3.,2,5,negative
2624,"After much researching into who had the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, Pequod's made the final 4 (Art of Pizza, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East were the others), which I tried while I was in Chicago, this past Fall. After having all 4, Pequod's ended up at the top of my list. Being a Pittsburgher, I think it's a travesty that they don't ship nationwide, like Malnati's and Gino's. That said, I have asked and they said they will par bake pies for shipment, but somebody would have to pick them up and ship them themselves. Might any of you local Chicagoites be willing to help out a fellow Pequod's-lover? If so, you can reach me at bassbone26@hotmail.com. Thanks!",4,1,positive

2633,"Being from the Suburbs of Chicago, and growing up next to a Lou Malnati's, I have never had anything close to compare to Lou's. Don't get me wrong Lou's is still #1 in my book... But if you're looking for some deep dish, this place is top notch. Pizza is a staple around these parts, and everyone has their deep dish pizzas, but nothing touches Pequod's style. Their caramelized crust is delicious, you cant just have one slice of it, likely half a pie in a sitting if you're being true to yourself. If you have a chance to get over there, do not pass it up. The parking for this place can be a little tricky, there is paid parking across the street, and if you're reaaaaaaally lucky you might be able to find local free parking, or maybe a meter'ed spot. Also the place is very small, so be prepared to wait for seating if you go during peak hours. Open late, and they deliver!",4,2,positive

2635,"My now husband and I knew we were meant to be when we determined our favorite Chicago pizza was undoubtedly Pequod's. When faced with the decision of where to have our rehearsal dinner last February, the solution was a no-brainer. The evening of the rehearsal dinner went perfectly. Their upstairs private party room is a little tight, but it was cozy, intimate and casual - just what we were looking for. The service was awesome. As a type-A bride-to-be, I have to say the only negative was their lack of traditional planning/coordination. We ""booked"" our event about 9 months out with an email from Pequod's saying, ""You got it, the date is yours."" We didn't sign a contract or put any money down, which felt different from the other vendors we booked. Regardless, after I allowed myself to trust in their process, we followed up with them a few times leading up to the event and they were warm, kind, and accommodating when we wanted to come tour the space. Would recommending hosting an intimate event here! And this goes without saying at this point - there pizza trumps all.",9,0,positive

I just felt like in comparison to Lou's or Giordanos-Pequod's just didn't hit the mark. I was excited to try the crust, given all the positive reviews, but it just tasted burnt and was less than satisfying.Side note-I ordered this for delivery and the girl who answered the phone had a bit of an attitude. I generally hate calling places-would much rather order online, but I didn't see an option to do so. I wanted to try this place since it had such good reviews, but the girl on the phone really turned me off.

2640,"I can only speak on Pequod's delivery as I have never actually been to the restaurant.Co-workers and I had a hankering for good Chicago style pizza, so we decided on Pequod's. I called right when they opened at 11am, and ordered two large pan pizzas for the 8 of us. The lady on the phone was less than polite, but it sounded like it was busy in there. Our office was out of the delivery zone but only by a few blocks, so they charged us a buck more and accommodated the order. She said it would be there in about an hour. I ended up getting a call from the delivery guy an hour an a half later. Bye bye, 5 star rating. The pizza was delicious. It had had enough time to cool off a bit and was the perfect temperature. Toppings were plentiful and that cheesy caramelized crust really sets it apart from its competitors. Will definitely order again.",9,1,positive
2641,"Pequod's Pizzeria has both thin crust and pan pizza offerings. I had to go pan because that's the way you get the caramelized crust which is Pequod's claim to fame. I'll admit I'm a bit particularly when it comes to pizza and really feel like the essential elements (crust, sauce, and cheese) have to come together to hit pizza perfection. The crust: true to style, chewy and bready on the interior but crispy and crunchy where it hits the pan with the carmelization from the cheese. The sauce: savory and really good, I actually got extra sauce on my pizza which is a great call for the pan style. The cheese: way too much for me, really the thing that makes this pizza the hardest to eat. If you want pan pizza in Chicago this is the place to come though. So far one of my favorite pie's in the city.",6,0,positive

No we said we could not wait and cancel the order.

2644,"I moved out of Chicago last week, and based on yelp reviews, I picked this place for my last Chicago meal. It was underwhelming. We got the cheesy bread as an app and a medium deep dish pizza. The cheesy bread was store bought bread, lots of cheese, with garlic powder on top.A 7 year old could have made this. The pizza itself was meh. The famous crust was a little too burnt for me, I think the amount of black on the crust was unhealthy. It was good pizza, but nothing at all memorable. I'm glad I read the reviews that said to get extra cheese, because their regular amount of cheese would not have been proportionate to the overall pizza. I would give this place 3 stars, but I had to tack a star off for the poor and slow service.",4,4,negative
2645,"YOU MUST GET THE SAUSAGE!!!! It's the best pizza sausage you can have. The ingredients are wonderful. The pizza has the perfect blend of cheese, sauce and crust.If there is one minute flaw to Pequod's it's that you have to take it easy on the toppings, because they really pile them up and it can overtake the pizza. Stick with 1-2 toppings and you'll be happy.Access to this place is not easy. It's a good 10-15 minute walk from the Fullerton Red Line. Parking is not fun. Unless you live in Lincoln Park, it's difficult. It's TOTALLY worth it though to try. Fantastic pizza!",9,2,positive

I had their wings which were tender with the perfect amount of heat. I highly recommend starting your meal off with a plate of them. Next, came the pizza. The deep dish was absolutely yummy. The sauce was smooth versus chunky and plentiful versus missing. The cheese and pepperoni were good completing the pie.

We order a medium sausage, onion and garlic pizza. The sausage is more like balls, like a meatball versus smaller pieces. I wasn't quite the fan of that, despite it being good. And I could only smell the garlic versus tasting it on the pizza. I think next time I'll switch it up and try other toppings. But it's definitely delicious!!!",6,3,positive

2655,"My favorite deep dish/pan pizza in the city, and it's not even a close call. First you must recognize the difference between pan pizza and deep dish/stuffed pizza. If you're looking for a cheese overdose and are expecting that mozza string that only breaks when you're holding the paddle a foot over your head, that is not this pizza, that is stuffed pizza. I prefer the ""light"" and fluffy crust of pan pizza to the thickly packed, flattened down cornmeal covered deep dish crust. Admittedly no there is not a ton of cheese on here, but I don't think that's too bad of a thing, especially when they offer extra cheese. I remember having Lou Malnati's for the first time and feeling disappointed. I don't like the patty layer of sausage, and with a lot of stuffed pizza places the toppings are under the cheese, which I really don't care for. The toppings should be crispy on top with a little char, not soggy floating around in cheese. Peqoud's took every tweak I would make in other pan pizza formulas and applied the changes I would make to create the perfect pie. LOL @ the review that said the cheesy garlic bread looked like they just added butter, garlic, and cheese to the bread wtf did you think cheesy garlic bread would have on it, foie gras? The caramelized cheese crust, I don't even need to tell you about, you've already heard it. Service is spot on, not in your face every minute, but your glass is never empty. The place is deceivingly larger than you think because they have an upstairs, so don't be discouraged if it looks full when you walk in! Anyway the pizza is also gorgeous, I remember finishing a huge slice and being full, and the table next to us was just getting their pie delivered to their table and I was like ""Ooo I want that. Wait. I have that. I just ate that. Omg I want theirs too though."" Anyway I'm in love with Peqoud's and if you have a single taste bud and/or brain cell you will too.",9,5,positive
2656,"Food: 3 out of 5Price: $$ out of $$$$Service: -5 out of 5I don't generally leave reviews unless I had exceptional or terrible experience. In this case, it was probably one of the worse service I have encountered at a restaurant... ever.We (7 of us) arrived at the restaurant on time for 6pm reservation. We were promptly seated 15 minutes later. We knew this was a very popular restaurant during dinner time so we expected reasonable wait (45min~) for our pizza to be ready. Knowing this, we ordered some wings, meatball sandwich (no cheese), large pizza pie and pitcher of beer. Beer and wings arrived shortly. Wings and beer were fine until my friend discovered a fly in his beer halfway thru his drink. We didn't make a big deal out of it thinking it's an innocent mistake. We told our waitress about it and she brought my friend a new glass of beer. So far so good... kinda.1.5 hours later, we are still waiting. Still no pizza, no meatball sandwich, no explanation by our waitress for the delay. We asked our waitress how much longer, and she says 5 more minutes. 25 minutes later, nothing (almost 2 hours of wait so far). We asked our waitress again, and she says 5 more minutes. Pizza finally arrives and we remind our waitress we are still waiting for meatball sandwich without cheese (one of our friend can't eat dairy). She said sandwich should be coming soon. We finish our pizza 20 minutes later and still no meatball sandwich. We ask our waitress about it, she said 5 more minutes (it's been almost 2.5 hours for meatball sandwich so far). 15 minutes more pass and finally meatball sandwich arrives but WITH cheese (it's been 2 hours and 45 minutes for a wrong sandwich). At this point we are fairly irritated because we waited 2 hours for a pizza and 2.75 hours for a meatball sandwich that my friend can't eat. At this point we decide to complain to the manager, Shawn. We explained our situation and he acted like ""oh well"". At no point did he apologize (for either wait or wrong order) or offer to fix the situation. He kept on saying ""wish there was something we can do"" without real resolution suggested. At this point, most restaurants with good customer service would have offered something for the terrible experience but nope, not Shawn. He just waited for us to leave. We did get a small discount for the meal (which wasn't what we were after) in the end but we left feeling petty and like shit.All we wanted was an apology and if we had received it, I wouldn't have written this review. I guess with plenty of customers other than us, they don't need to make things right even when they mess up.",13,7,negative
2657,"Came here for Chicago style pizza after searching on Yelp. The restaurant had great atmosphere with locals supporting the Cubs in a playoff game. We ordered bbq buffalo wings, French fries, and deep dish pizza (tomato, garlic, sausage, extra cheese). While the first two items were very good, the pizza was not. The crust was flaky, devoid of taste, and just too much of it. Nothing else on the pizza stood out. The service was excellent, which is why three stars instead of two. Happily (for the crowd) the Cubs won that night...",5,2,negative
2658,"We went this evening. First time there and the pie was outstanding. Did not disappoint. We had both pan and thin crush and both were excellent.  Among the best I've ever had. So why only 2 stars? The service sucked! And to be specific, out server SUCKED! Don't know her name, only know her as server MZ07. Here are the lowlights.1) Bitch slapped us for wanting new silverware after our salads. Said they were too busy to roll silverware into napkins and that we should have kept what we had. Really? My gal joked that she would gladly go role her own, and without hesitation or a smile was told that was ""not an option"". As though we were serious.2) We waited 80 minutes for our pizza's while other larger tables that came in after us got theirs ahead of us. No apology, no sorry for the delay, nothing.3) Asked for more water and got attitude when we thought she didn't hear us.4) Not once did she ask us how our meal was. Not once! I know she was busy, but come on. It's called very basic customer service.5) My favorite. When I asked for the check and got no acknowledgment, I asked again. All I got was a very stern ""I heard you""!One of the least pleasant servers we've ever had. I fully understand that the place was packed and that it's a very challenging job to say the least. That said, as long as you're at it you might as well try to be good at it. Try being just a little pleasant. She might want to consider another line of work. Just sayin'",11,7,negative
2659,"I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of this place. And the service was quick and good as well. We got small jalapeño, mushroom, sausage and pepperoni pan pizza. It was awesome.

2663,"Went here with my boyfriend 2 months ago, with a 2 hour time limit on a Friday night. We ended up actually walking out because we still hadn't received our food and the service was an ABOMINATION.Today we tried it again, for the lunch special, with our gift certificate we received because of the bad service from Round 1. Pizza is solid. Very good, not great or amazing.  Chicken tenders were overpriced and gross.  They were basically cheapy chicken nugget kind of things. The ambience leaves something to be desired. The radio was so loud, with obnoxious ads and DJs more often than music, and very fuzzy and annoying. Our beers were nowhere near cold enough. While I appreciate the effort to redeem themselves after our bad first experience, Pequod's is still exactly what 3 stars means: a-ok, and nothing more.",7,6,negative

At that point, I was informed that it'd be another 30-45 minutes because my order wasn't placed until 6:50PM. I questioned the delay (I called at 6:30PM and certainly did not have a 20 minute call). At that point the manager got on the line to tell me they had a computer glitch, my order wasn't entered until 6:50PM, and I would have to wait an additional 30-45 minutes.

At that point, the manager complained that I was in the wrong and hung up on me!!!!We WERE regulars at this place. NEVER AGAIN!!!",0,5,negative
2667,"Yes this is really 'as good as it gets' for deep dish pizza in Chicago. I've tried Giardinos, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's, and this DePaul suburban establishment definitely takes the crown as BEST. This place is a no brainer and all you need are a set of taste buds to realize this is great pizza. The ingredients are phenomenally fresh and toppings are generous. Flavorful homemade marinara sauce and a buttery soft crust, make this a very well rounded pizza.Pequods is definitely the place to be and is worth the quick trip on the loop to Lincoln Park. Can't wait to visit again soon!",8,0,positive
2668,"This place is nothing special, in fact its pretty sub par. I'm not sure if Pequod's USED to be good and has just lost its touch but I can definitely say this place's pizza is boring.What I ordered:Onion Rings (about 7 of them pathetically displayed on a plate)12 inch Deep dish pizza with Sausage and BasilThe Crust - Spongy cornmeal somewhere in between buttery, crispy and soggy. Not terrible but as far as a foundation for a pie its nothing exciting.The Sauce - If there were any herbs or spices in the sauce, I couldn't taste them. Pizza suffers the most when the sauce is bad and this was just tomato paste and sugar with maybe a sprinkle of pepper.The Cheese - this was the most disappointing part of the whole meal, there was no flavor and no salt. My professional guess is that they use a cheap skim milk mozzarella, no provolone or whole milk. It reminded me of peal and eat mozzarella sticks from a gas station, but that would be insulting cause at least those are loaded with sodium.The Toppings - the second worst part about this pizza, it was adorned with about 10 pieces of sausage the size of golf balls and what was probably 3 leaves of furiously fine shredded basil. The sausage was actually pretty good but there wasn't nearly enough of it, about 2 pieces a piece. And the basil, I'm not sure they even put any on it.",6,8,negative
2669,"The herbaceousness of the sausage is a step shy of critical mass: so righteous a ratio of spices-to-meat that vegetarians get confused and carnivores...well, carnivores just feel hungry for more.But the true crown of the Pequod's 'za is the crust. It caramelizes. Put the word ""caramelizes"" in italics in your mind in the prior sentence. Give it urgency. Who else does that? Seriously, tell me in the comments, because I want more o' that...but I still defy any house in town to match the mystical Pequod's sausage. I don't care if it sounds gay. In fact put that in italics...just to make it fabulous. The original kitchen, In '06, burned down. The cooks, in their envelope-pushing ways, set in motion the inferno after heating the oven until it became its own sentient life form. The oven, only pretending to shut off when the kitchen staff closed, burst into flame like a teen whose parents' vacation flight just went wheels up, only the damage was harder to cover up with a Swiffer. Now, that's just rumor, but we're Americans, and we need our history to feel connected. Coming soon: an app to track the oven temperatures at Pequod's, but instead of a red ""warning"" indicator, there's a cute graphic of ingredients for s'mores. Open up your uber when it reaches ""graham cracker smoosh"" (looks as cute it sounds). Parking, like the sausage, will get out of hand.",7,7,positive

2673,"Ask your Chicago friends where to eat and they give you the best!Under the recommendation from my brother from another mother, he told us that this place is one of the best pizza places! He was right! It is walking distance to DePaul University (he went there) and about 3 miles from our hotel. We decided to cab it to this pizzeria and walk back to burn off those calories! The restaurant/bar looks small on the outside, but when you get in, it is actually bigger. It is two stories and there is plenty of seating upstairs. We arrived pretty early (round 12) to beat the crowds and there was no wait for us to be seated. This is the ""official"" Blackhawks bar. My friend says ""EVERY bar"" is the official Blackhawks bar. Anyway, we got the lunch special (individual pizza and soda) for about $6.00. It was a good deal! Apparently, they used to serve the special with beer, but that stopped due to the new laws. Anyway, we shared a salad which tasted very fresh and helped ease my hunger pains while waiting for the deep dish. Deep dish pizza takes awhile, but it is worth the wait!I got pepperoni and spinach for my deep dish and I am a fan of deep dish. Wow. The sauce is sweet but tangy and the cheese....so much goodness! The small individual pizza looks small, but is fairly big and difficult to finish. The crust is crunchy and a bit thicker than I hoped for, but still very tasty! I did not finish my deep dish because it was just so much (Shame, shame!), but was glad to have it while on the walk back. The staff is friendly and really nice. Our waitress gave good recommendations and told of us other tourist attractions. She was very knowledgeable! The atmosphere is very chill and seems to be frequented by the college audience, since DePaul University is within walking distance.",19,5,positive

Its not like this place is any cheaper than the other places.  The crust doesn't have the same great cornmeal taste of Malnatis. I will say the delivery was on time which is where they are getting some stars from me. I'm glad I tried it so I can check it it off my list. Id order from Malnatis during my next visit,6,0,negative
2684,Went to Chicago for the first time and of course had to try some Chicago deep dish pizza.  My wife and I shared a meat lovers style pizza.  It was very good but the crust only covered about half the pizza on the bottom which was odd.  Flavor was very good though.  We also had fried mozzarella sticks and fried mushrooms and they were great.  We enjoyed the place overall but the pizza didn't quite live up to the hype.  Maybe we came on an off day...,4,3,positive

Not to mention, my beer glass sat empty for the 40 minutes we didn't see our waitress. In regards to the pizza itself, it was good! As my first real Chicago deep-dish experience, I can tell you that the crust was really good (really the best part in my opinion), the sauce was a little bland in flavor for me, and even though they didn't use very much cheese, it was good. I would have been tempted to try another place had I had more time to better compare the two, but it actually reminded me of what an ""expensive Pizza Hut personal pan pizza with less sodium"" would probably taste like. Would I eat it again? Absolutely! Would I wait longer than 30/40 minutes total for this pizza? Not exactly.",8,2,negative
2697,"It's soooo good! The sauce is not as chunky as other places and the crust isn't as thick as some of the others, but the emphasis here is on the toppings!!

2707,A disappointing meal. The food took a really long time to come out (90mins approx)- we were a larger group but the food didn't all come at once so it was surprising that it took so long. We ordered some starters which seemed to have just come straight out of a frozen packet- not very flavoursome. I had deep dish pizza with a mix of vegetables. The toppings were good but the base tomato sauce and cheese was not to my liking. Other people in our party had a mix of deep dish and thin base and seemed to have a similar complaint. Overall it just didn't have a great flavour. I've heard great things about this place so maybe it was because it wasn't what we were used to pizza wise. Staff were pleasant and attentive,7,3,negative

But while waiting for your pie to come out it would be nice to be actually waited on. I had only 1 drink while waiting over an hour and a half for our pizza. Had our waitress (who we only saw once at the beginning) come by more frequently, myself and my party would have ordered plenty of drinks. We didn't even get refills of our water.

This means that the crust gets nice and caramelized, which adds textural contrast and helps it not to be all mushy. Pequods also makes phenomenal meatballs - worth a detour just for them.",5,1,positive

2721,"I've heard so much about this pizza that I was excited when coworkers decided get together and order some.  They ended up ordering a sausage, bacon and pepperoni pizza. And it was a pretty tasty pizza, even though it wasn't very hit when we got it, we had to heat it up in the microwave. I wouldn't say that it's the best in Chicago though. I can say that I have had better pizza in Chicago that would be more apt to take that position. I don't know if getting it delivered versus eating it there makes a difference. But I will try them again, and do when I have an opportunity to sit down and eat inside the restaurant. And provide an update to my review at that time.",4,0,negative
2722,"It's pretty good.  I don't know why this often gets listed among one of the best deep dish pizzas in the city, though.  I found the crust a little lacking, the sauce just a bit bland, and the sausage tasted a little strange to me.  I would go with Lou's, Giordano's, and Gulliver's pan pizza over this place.  I'd still come here, though, just wouldn't be my first choice.",3,2,negative
2723,Holy cow! Amazing pizza! I think this is the best in Chicago! The service is bad (I really mean bad) but the food is worth it. I think the secret is in the unwashed pans they use to cook the pizza.,2,2,positive
2724,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!  There is nothing left I can say about Pequod's that hasn't already been said by the other 1,100 reviewers.  The caramelized crust, the pan blackened bottom, and the secret sauce are the 3 components that make this the best deep dish in Chicago. Seating can be tricky on a busy night and the pizza can take a while to come out at times but to me this is all just part of Pequod's personality and vibe.  Pizza this delicious shouldn't be made too easy to get, so the long wait only adds to the appreciation of the magic.There are times where I wake up salivating from dreaming about the Pequod's tomato sauce and that blackened and buttery crust.  If you haven't tried Pequod's yet, then do yourself a favor and go there immediately!",6,1,positive

As 50 minutes go by we start to notice big parties who came after us made comments that they paid under the table to get in earlier, of course they get seated... As I ask the host when will my party be seated he then can't even give me a time and just says there is two parties still ahead of us. Sad to have wasted my time. I get this place is popular and constantly packed, but at the end of the day ever person deserves the same respectable service... flat out disappointing.",3,2,negative

2728,"Honestly, I thought this pizza was very average. Gave up carbs for 16 days, only to break it by eating this pizza - which sadly wasn't worth it. I ordered a half pepperoni/half green pepper and onions pan pizza. The bread is way too doughy, minimal sauce, minimal cheese, and super large ingredients. The only part I actually liked was the caramelized crust. Apps - Cheesy Garlic Bread - literally just took a roll, cut it in half, added butter, garlic and cheese...not much to it. There wasn't any seasoning or anything special about the bread. Also got Mozzarella sticks - these were obviously frozen before, and ended up being soggy by the time they came to me. I wish I could have loved this place, but it just didn't happen.",4,3,negative

2730,"6 years ago I hated deep dish pizza (and yes, I'm am a Chicagoan born and raised), HOWEVER, when my wife brought me to Pequods in 2008 my taste buds experienced a moment of pure ecstasy that only a perfect Chicago deep dish pizza can create! We had a sausage and spinach deep dish pizza and my mind was blown! Alas, I have been forever ruined. When I eat regular pizza I think of only Pequods and how I could be experiencing something better. When I'm eating there I never wanna leave. My fat soul has been won over by their incredibly, mind changing recipe and all I wanna do is shout out their amazing-ness from the top of the Sears tower (I refuse to call it the ""W"" word)! Anyways, please don't give up on deep dish till you have tried Peqouds... I DARE YOU!!!! Muahhaahaahhaaaaa!!!!!",7,4,positive

But....Pequods is the exception. I've been here many a time and it never disappoints. Basically stick to pizza and beers here. They don't take reservations really so plan accordingly. It gets crowded if there is a big game on, but trust me it's worth the wait. Personal favs=mushroom+sausage and the pepperoni+pepperoncini. But really, come to think of it, their veggie is killer too! IN SHORT, ALL ZA HERE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you have not been to Pequods yet, I highly suggest you get there ASAP for good food and good times.",6,3,positive

Monday- Friday until 3pm, you can order a personal pizza and a soda/draft beer for a measly $5!  You can't beat that!But let's talk about what makes the pizza magical. It's all in the crust! How I have dreamed of only devouring the crust! It will blow your mind! Everyone that I know who has experienced the magic of Pequods will agree. Also, considering that Pequods is also a bar, you wouldn't expect top quality customer service, but that's what I have gotten here.  I don't eat pork but love pepperoni...turkey that is. I actually called Pequods and asked them if they would be ok with me brining in my own turkey pepperoni. Most restaurants have never obliged, but Pequods was more Han happy to meet my request. I was pleasantly surprised and even more enamored by the delicious food but wonderful customer service. Oh, they now deliver and even delivered to my home though I was a little outside their delivery range because they weren't busy at that moment. That's customer service at its best!",10,1,positive
2737,"Great Chicago deep dish. It's fun atmosphere, your typical Chicago pizza joint. Lots of wood, stuff about sports, booths, etc. The waitstaff is incredibly nice. My friend lost her phone into the abyss of a crack in between the wall and a booth and they were very nice to fish it out for her. We ordered mozzarella sticks and a salad (in our poor attempt to have something healthy), which were good. We also did a couple slices of the thin crust (because none of us had ever tried it before). We ordered 2 deep dishes, and since there was 6 of us, we had plenty to take home. The sausage is incredible on the pizza and all the veggies are fresh and crisp, even after being in the oven. It's a must if you are visiting the city.",9,2,positive
2738,"Wow, I sure don't get what all the hype is about. I found the pizza dry and unremarkable.  My Pie/Lil' Guys is a much better deep dish in my opinion. But the real reason I'm giving them one star is that I called on a Tuesday night and was quoted a 90 minute delivery window. It actually took nearly 2 hours, and of course was barely warm when it go here.I'll not be ordering again.",2,1,negative

2740,"We were told Pequod's has some of the best deep dish Chicago-style pizza in the whole city. Coming from the East Coast, we were excited to try it. Although the restaurant is known to be packed on the weekends, we easily got a table on a Monday evening. Each additional topping was $2.75, which seemed like a lot considering we only ordered pepperoni and black olive. Pequod's famously uses old cast iron pans that have been blackened over the years, allowing the crust and the cheese to melt together and form a crispy caramelized layer. We learned that ""deep-dish"" at Pequod's refers to a thick bottom crust, as opposed to ""stuffed"" deep dish where your chosen topics are incorporated inside the pizza. Pequod's was a great introduction to Chicago-style deep dish.",5,0,positive
2741,"Underwhelming! So after waiting half an hour to be seated we were sat at a table about a foot and a half in width. Not only was the table tiny it was in the middle of the narrow restaurant ( more of a bar really) where people kept bumping our table and a waitress spilt my bfs beer all over him. We moved tables when one became available but the waitress threw my full beer away and took 20 minutes to replace it. When we got our pizza an hour later it was less than average. The only reason I came here was because it was rated the best deep dish in Chicago, I'm from california so I really wanted to try Chicago pizza. It was also really over priced, I'd rather eat round table than here!",2,1,negative
2742,Went here because friends raved about the pan pizza...maybe it was my expectations but I was underwhelmed. It's not that anything was wrong per say but I've definitely had more flavorful pizza at other places in Chicago. Friendly staff though! And it's a nice casual atmosphere.,1,1,negative

2745,"Maybe I was expecting a lot. I was in Chicago for a few days and I really wanted to try their famous deep dish pizza. Given the high reviews, I thought this would make an excellent first experience. Thinking this place might be busy, I had called this place to make a reservation. When I arrived and told them of my reservation, I was asked to wait for almost half an hour despite there being open tables. They were however very busy so I let this one slide.I was told the pizza would take a while to cook so I ordered some appetizers while we waited. I ordered the appetizer combo which consisted of mozzarella sticks, jalepeno poppers, breaded mushrooms, and something else that I dont even remember. Why dont i remember? because they all tasted the same. They were all just breaded up in some bread crumbs and deep fried and tastes more like something from the frozen foods aisle of a grocery store than a restaurant. Even the presentation sucked. But I let this one slide as well. This is a pizza place after all, and I should let pizza be the judge of this place. So the pizza came and it looked great. After a few bites, I must say that it was okay. I really really tried to like it, but it tasted okay. The ""carmelized crust"" was more like burnt crust. Unlike a normal deep dish where it is comprised mostly of cheese and toppings with a thin crust, here the pan pizza had a very thick crust and a very thin topping. I felt like I was eating a pizza bagel.After this experience, I almost believed that I just didnt like chicago pizza. Thank god I went to Lou Malnati's two days later and had some real deep dish. It was delicious!",10,3,negative

The wait time nearly killed me, over an hour to bring out our pizzas, but I was starving. I think I actually prefer Giordanos because it has the extra sauce and the layers, but this was also phenomenal. Chicago deep dish delish.",2,0,positive

2749,"I thought Pequod's was OKAY, it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be in my opinion! The pizza was more burnt than expected on the edges and the sausage just wasn't all that special! There was way too much crust compared to how many ""pieces"" of sausage that was actually on the pizza. I liked Lou M's much more!",2,0,negative

2751,"I visited Pequod's on my first trip to Chicago after attempting unsuccessfully to get into uber-famous Lou Malnati's, which was jam-packed on a Friday night at 8PM. I wasn't going to wait 2 hours for pizza, so a friend who lives in the city suggested we try the less-famous Pequods.I am so glad we tried this place instead. We still had to wait an hour to be seated (this is after calling ahead for what I was told was ""priority seating"" and a 25 minute wait), but it was worth it. And, seriously, if you're getting pizza on a Friday night, you should expect heavy wait times.Our party of 4 ordered a medium deep dish pizza. The men in our group protested the idea of such a ""small"" pie, but the ladies were glad we stuck to our guns. 6 pieces of deep dish glory was plenty to go around.Our pan pizza had mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni on it. The crust was crunchy and delicious at first, though it did get soggy after a few minutes. But I have no complaints. The burnt cheese around the edge of this pizza was sublime.And the sausage:  Oh, the sausage. It was soft and casing-free (score! I hate chewing on sausage casings), and had a lovely hint of fennel. I've never tasted such yummy sausage.I wished there was more cheese, but I'm not complaining. This was my first Chicago pizza, and it was pretty darn good.",9,5,positive
2752,"The pizza. What can I say?  It's honestly freaking delicious.  Now, I am not one to stand on a soapbox and diatribe daily about the superiority of pizza to other foods. Because usually- I wouldn't eat pizza if you paid me.  But here... This pizza is seriously delicious.We came on a Friday evening, it was jammed pack. More sardines than in a old Soviet tin but we held on to our patience and stalked the guests at the bar for their seat like hawks.  It's the only way to eat in a halfway reasonable amount of time- say an hour. But a good 2 hours later, when the pizza finally came.  It melted away my angry.  You say, oh it must be the joy of alleviating hungry after such a long wait.  But no sir- I kindly filled my gluttony with wings and salad.  But let's get back to the main point- the pizza was the bombdiggity.  The crust was thick but not soggy.  Cheese, this could be improved as I could barely taste it. But the toppings.  Oh the toppings! Seriously made you want to slap your female paternal unit- yes it was that good.  Dense, packed and meatballs the size of fists- it definitely didn't leave you wanting.Trust me. Coming from someone who literally lives to eat and studies taste like the Quran, if you ever feel the need for pizza.  You will not regret eating here, as long you can survive the painful waiting.",11,5,positive

2760,"Really three and a half stars. Pizza was good, as Chicago deep-dish goes. Service was just OK, and the appetizers were pretty standard. Ambiance was dark, kind of like a sports bar.

Since then, I have been back and will continue to dine there.",7,1,positive
2763,This was my first time having pequods and also my last. Was quoted at an hour and a half for delivery. 2 and a half hours later I had to call and they had no idea where the pizza was but it arrived shortly after.

Glad I got to pay full price for a lukewarm pizza after 2 and a half hours.,3,0,negative
2764,"For the life of me.. I cannot understand why or how anyone finds this food enjoyable. Both thin crust and deep dish taste like a trial run homemade pizza - done horribly. The sauce tastes like it's right out of a can, the crust is dry and tasteless, and the cheese came sliding all around the pizza - hardly cooked or sliced properly. The only reason I gave it a second chance was because they messed up my order the first time - Sent me a deep dish when I ordered thin crust, then gave me a credit instead of refunding the money. Thanks for the credit, but everything I've tried is just.. Bad.",5,0,negative

2770,"Of all the well known deep dish pizza spots in Chicago, Pequod's was recommended the most by my friends, and definitely looked the best on all the social media pictures I salivated through. The ambiance was super chill. More like a bar with pizza than simply a pizzeria. Service was quick and efficient despite the fact that it was quite busy. We were four total, and ordered two deep dishes, one with pepperoni and one with peppers, onion, mushroom, and sausage. They looked AMAZING!!! Caramelized crust, generous portions of toppings, and tons of cheese. I was so friggin' excited! Especially since it was my first authentic Chicago deep dish experience. I had been waiting for that moment for 24 years, no joke. When I picked up the spatula to serve myself a ""slice"" the cheese was oh so gooey and perfectly stringy. I felt like I was in a commercial. Finally, the moment of truth arrives. I took a bite of the picture perfect pizza, annnnnnnd I was incredibly underwhelmed. It had absolutely no flavor. The cheese lacked salt, the sauce lacked tang (not robust at all), and the crust was crunchy but there was no flavor to the dough. UGH! I was so incredibly disappointed. Everything else was perfect EXCEPT the flavor. Adding salt salvaged the pizza, but the painful memory of the first bite will always remain. I loved everything else about this place and the pizza but the actual flavor of it. Or as far as I'm concerned, lack there of.",17,4,negative

Nothing else needs to be said. We sat on the second floor and had great service. I really wish they could send me some pizza right about now cause I'm really craving it. Anyways, ambiance was cool and the only thing I didn't like was the crummy Blackhawks sign when you come down the stairwell (Go Kings)..but I am in their territory so I can't be mad! Also, the painted wizard in the upstairs bathroom just adds more character to the place. I found that extremely cool too! Will be back when I'm in Chicago again.",10,2,positive

I've been to Pequod's three times and, generally, I find the experience to be enjoyable and all three were about the same. But here's the thing - people go ape$h!t for this place so it's always packed. Personally, the 'burnt cheese on the crust' thing for me doesn't really do it. So, it's not my favorite deep dish and therefore I don't think it's worth it. I've also heard of people losing their reservations or spot in line for being 5 minutes late. Last time we were here we got bumped because the server didn't find us when we were standing right there waiting... So, yea, Pequod's is really good pizza - but it's not my favorite and really isn't worth the wait for the okay service you get.",7,1,negative
2777,"So I never write reviews, but I tried this place because it looked amazing on Chicago's best. For the record I don't live in the area, I live on the very border of their delivery area, so there are some things I expected. Like possibly the food being a bit cold or the pan pizza to be a bit soggy. But to be honest it looked amazing when it arrived, still steaming hot and nice crunchy looking crust, I ordered a medium pan pizza sausage and half onion, THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST PIZZAS IVE EVER HAD!!! INCREDIBLY BLAND, NO FLAVOR, NO SEASONING! NOTHING!!!! I ordered a small cheese for my kids, and it was the same thing, bland and plain! Super disappointing..

They closed at 2 am so I asked if a 1:30 am delivery was too much of a hassle. I was told no, but that's when things got ugly. ""Okkkkkkk"" was the response from said individual when I requested a large pan pepperoni. It was as if I was making her night harder. How dare I order a pizza within their operating hours? I've ordered from the Morton Grove location many times and it's always been fantastic, but this was incredibly pathetic service. I don't normally leave reviews, but this was so incredibly insulting that I had to. The attitude I was greeted with was incredibly pompous, and I immediately ended the transaction.

It came out in about 30 minutes and I was impressed with the sausage""s flavor, pepperoni was meh, extra cheese was also a good choice as always. The crust was very crispy around the edges and caramelized cheese set it the f off.",3,0,positive
2786,"I have been to Pequod's so many times! This is the place to go get your pizza.  Service can be slow at times but mostly because they are always packed (which is a good sign) .They make one of the few deep dish pizza I actually like, extensive drinking menu, and TVs all around for you to follow that game you like so much.",3,1,positive
2787,My favorite deep dish in Chicago. The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for a pizza place. and they let you order your deep dish when you put your name in so the wait time once you sit down is minimal. Sometimes I dream about the caramelized crust...,3,0,positive
2788,"Best deep dish pizza in the city, hands down.Get literally anything and it'll be awesome. Staff is friendly and outgoing, area is nice, upstairs seating is pretty nifty, and the food is amazing if I haven't already mentioned.I'm not even kidding... I noticed their fountain soda just tastes better than other fountain sodas. They must have a really good water purification system for making their pizza dough? Just a guess, but I bet I'm right!Oh also! If you get your pizza wrapped up to go, they put aluminum foil around it. This impressed the hell out of me because I've always done that to my pizza when I bring it home anyway. Well done Pequod's, well done.",11,1,positive

2794,"Came in here for lunch. Had there lunch special which is a personal pizza, salad and drink for $5-6 bucks. When I came on a Friday afternoon, place was busy. Sat at the bar with some coworkers so we didn't have to wait as long. The guy at the bar was really friendly and helped us with our order. I'm from SoCal and pizza is def my favorite thing to eat so Chicago style was a must to get when in town. Thought pizza was excellent. It reminded me of what Chicago style pizza is about. This place does get crowded and service can run a little on the slow side so be prepared. Overall good experience.",5,2,positive
2795,Was super excited to try this place after hearing so much. We ordered take out and the lady who took our order was great. We got home and I was super excited to dive in to the pizza. I cut myself a slice to find that this wasn't deep dish. This was an inch tall cornbread dough with some sauce and cheese on top. The carmalized crust was burnt cheese that didn't make the whole circumference of the pizza. I was disappointed. I prefer Lou malnatis or giordanos.,7,1,negative
2796,"Warning: NOT CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA! My experience with people who rave about this pizza is they are usually not from Chicago. As far as pan pizza goes.. this is more like pizza bread. The pizza is simply a VERY thick bread with sauce,cheese and toppings. Granted, it doesnt taste bad at all.. its just not real chicago style. The burned cheese/crust thing is good.. but not good enough to bring me back. Lou Malnatis butter crust is better. The pizza here is not like the real stuff you get at Lou Malnatis, Giordonos, Ginos East, or Gullivers. Really, the best way to describe it is pizza bread. Also, the service was medicore. We had a big group,which I understand is difficult, but she was terrible. She forgot appetizers and brought them when we got our food and getting a refill on a drink was next to impossible. All the hype about this place is really just all talk. Go someplace else if you want pizza.    PS. The bathrooms upstairs are very strange. The auto hand dryer is right above the toilet. when u are sitting and doing your thing it blows on you the whole time. It was very uncomfortable. If we hadnt already ordered our food I would have left because of that!",7,8,negative
2797,"Definitely a tasty deep dish spot. I wasn't thrilled with the service - it felt like it took us forever to get drinks, and then forever again to order.

2800,"If you are in the Lincoln Park/DePaul area, you really need to check out Pequod's Pizzeria.  Until yesterday, I've never been but some friends were hungry after seeing a move at the Regal Webster Place 11 (which is across the street) and they have been here several times,When you approach this ""hole-in-the-wall"" pizzeria, you may want to walk right past it since it's among other stores.  Once inside, you'll be ""greeted"" by the ""self- important"" hostess.   We were seated at a great table by the door - no big deal.  It was a great table to watch people and watch sports on the many tvs.The restaurant is long and narrow with plenty of booths and small tables for two.  Towards, the back by the kitchen, there were larger tables that could be larger groups - not to large.  The bar was also very accessible for those waiting for a table.  I could image this place get packed on the weekends.The server was very pleasant and very inattentive.  Never overbearing.  Yes, the servers wear sports shirts or t-shirts but it fit in the atmosphere, which is very casual, sports bar, family neighborhood place.  I noticed a lot of carry outs which is a good sign.For as steady as the restaurant was, the pizzas came to our table in a reasonable amount of time.  My buddies had the deep dish with just about everything on it and I had the thin crust with pepperoni which was excellent!  The deep dish looked just as good and as much as they ate, it must have been also good.   The sauce was just right...not to spicy and not overbearing.  Looking forward trying the deep dish next time.The prices are very reasonable for the area.So if you are the neighborhood, I would highly recommend that you check this place out!",15,1,positive
2801,"Best pizza on the universe - this place is no joke.As a Chicago native (and pizza lover) transplanted to the west coast, any time a friend is headed to Chicago and asks me where to eat this is where I send them.  This is not your touristy Gino's, Uno, Lou Malnati's type pizza - this is a legit locals only spot.",1,0,positive

2804,"A virgin to Chiciago's deep dish pizza, I was thoroughly impressed - almost. The almost is that I'd recommend they serve sides of sauce to dip the extra thick crust in. But, that's just my own personal preference. Expect  to wait at least 45 minutes when ordering a deep-dish pizza (it just takes awhile to bake) but expect to fill your stomach with one epic slice! (maybe two if you're really hungry!) The crush is absolutely amazing. At first glance it looks burnt, but, oh so good! This place is popular so if you time it right you may be seated right away, otherwise you are probably looking at a 1-2 hour wait, especially on a weekend.The ambiance is a darker and slightly loud setting with dark wood tables and a ""bar like"" feel to it. Overall a casual, young, trendy and fun for all ages restaurant. The service was smooth and friendly.",12,3,positive
2805,Best deep dish in Chicago if you like crust more than sauce. Their crust is soft and crunchy... It's really good!,3,0,positive
2806,"These guys do deep dish right! I got the personal size pizza with pepperoni and olives. After I ordered, I feared they would overdo it with the olives like some places, but they keep the olives to a moderate amount. The crust! It was amazing. The carmelized cheese was delicious and the pizza in general was solid.",5,0,positive
2807,"Although it's a bit different from your traditional Chicago style deep dish, Pequods pan pizza is my favorite when I am craving pizza.  The way they sprinkle the crust with cheese to create the burnt cheese on the edge of the crust is unique and delicious.  They have great appetizers - wings are solid.  Stop by the Drinkingbird if there is a long line on the weekends, it's the bar right near it which is awesome as well.If I could eat Pequod's every day and not get fat I would do it without thinking twice.Lately we have been getting pinapple, onion, and canadian bacon.  In the past I usually stuck to sausage, spinach and mushroom.  Yum.",6,2,positive
2808,"One of my favorites in the city for sit down real pizza in the pan type of place. Love the food, hate the wait. This is beyond good pizza and a rare take on a crust. You need to try it to understand. You should give this at least one try and you will be hooked - pepperoni is the best! Like Gino's East but better! Great service but can be very long wait for a table - call ahead to check on wait time no reservations accepted on some nights. Forget a game night service will lack. Parking is tough, they have a location in Morton Grove which is even a longer wait but easier parking.",5,1,positive

2810,"I've been to Pequods a few times and if I averaged them all out, this is definitely an accurate score. I understand Pequods was recently featured as one of the best pizza places in the country, which explains the insane volume of patrons attempting to fulfill their deep dish needs. However, that's no excuse for three and a half hour ""dining"" experiences. A thirty minute wait with a 45 minute pizza cook time is totally acceptable... Not 90 minutes and 90 minutes. I will say the pizza is normally fantastic. This last time it was subpar, but I'm assuming (hoping) that was due to the volume of orders coming though. I will say that the restaurant manager was working his tail off and did everything in his power to help the place run smoothly. At one point he was holding a large deep dish while running a tables credit card and taking a phone order. He deserves a raise.",4,2,negative
2811,"Pequod's is super loud and incredibly busy, but it's worth it. Their pizza is my favorite in the city known for stuffed pizza.",4,0,positive
2812,"BEST pizza in Chicago hands down. It's the perfect combination between thin and the traditional deep dish Chicago pizza, it's a not too thick pan style pizza with crunchy cheese melted on the crust. It's pure perfection. Add meatballs to your pizza, you won't be disappointed!",3,1,positive
2813,"As far as pan pizza goes, I would say Pequods definitely has a leg up on Burt's but it doesn't stand up overly well to the deep dish spots (Ginos, Lou's, Uno) as they just don't put enough cheese or sausage on the pie. The amount of crust can really overwhelm the flavor of anything else-- and even with the caramelized cheese on top, the crust tends to lack flavor. The biggest plus about Pequods is the generous amount of sauce they put on the pie. Chunky tomatoes with garlic and a hint of oregano, their sauce adds a lot of flavor to the pizza. If they just put some more cheese and toppings, I'd say they warrant four stars. For price, these guys do it right. For $5 you can get a personal pan pizza at lunch. The personal pan is only $8 at dinner also-- so very reasonable.",6,0,negative

It's thinner than most and although it may look burnt it's actually just blackened with tons and tons of flavor so don't skip eating it.The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni (the last pizza I got from here) blended together in a perfect mix of flavors and textures that only deep dish could.Their ingredients taste fresh and are very flavorful. Some of the better pepperoni I have had in my life.Will order from here again, guaranteed.",8,0,positive
2817,"You can't beat their deep dish. My favorite deep dish pizza for sure. When my manfriend lived in Chicago, I would beg to go to this place! It's always packed, so you order your pizza, and then when it's ready, they seat you. It's somewhat chaotic sometimes, but grab a beer and relax! :-) Even though you don't get seated till the pizza is done, it's always piping hot!",3,2,positive
2818,"Definitely the best Chicago style pizza I've had. Something about that cheesy caramelized dough that gets all crispy and wonderful. Also, one of the best lunch deals ever, if you've got the time to spare. Can't speak to more than the lunch portion of pizza, but why should I need to? This is a Chicago pizza place, and that's what they do and they do it really well. My go to is extra cheese and extra sauce, can't go wrong.",4,2,positive
2819,Pequot's makes me want to go back to Chicago!!!! When I visited Chicago we asked every uber/lyft/local from Chicago where the best deep dish pizza was and everyone geared us toward Lou Malnati's or Giordano's Pizzeria. So we tired all of them and hands down Pequot's was the best deep dish in Chicago!!!! loved it!,3,1,positive
2820,"Just starting off that this is my favorite deep dish pizza place. Great pizza! I go pretty often but this is the second time in which I had very poor service. We ordered 1 10"" pizza that took an hour and half to make. And the server only came to our table once even though she kept going up to every table around us, it was really odd. She only came when the pizza arrived (someone else brought the pizza and served it to us.) and she noticed that our waters were empty. So for the entire hour and half that we were waiting for our pizza, she didn't come up to our table. Our pizza also ended up burnt and I to flag the waitress down to tell her. Manager took it off the bill and gave use a gift card though. Staff just didn't really seem apologetic to be honest. No thank you or sorry when we left, waitress just handed us the gift card because we got up from our table. Note this is the second time I received bad service (there's another yelp review about that experience from someone else).",4,2,negative
2821,"Really crowded place with decent pizza. The crust is a little weird for me. It tastes almost like it has burnt cheese on it? Definitely not bad, just different. My favorite is still Lou's. It's worth a try though. I would recommend eating in over delivery. You can really taste a difference!",5,3,negative

2823,"The meatballs were amazing on this pan dish pizza. The crust was extremely buttery and cheesy, however, I do prefer a deep dish pizza as opposed to the pan pizza that they have here, it's just all about preference.  It was a nice change especially as I pigged out on Chicago deep dish pizzas for about 3-4 weekends in a row.  Don't judge!  ;P",3,1,positive
2824,"Yes. Best pizza in Chicago. Its a hike from a train station, but the whole walk back I'm thinking, ""that was delicious."" Not that I sit around talking about food with my friends often, but Pequods is a regular topic of conversation among a group of friends I have.",1,0,positive

2826,"I was told by a local restaurant owner (not pizza) that no one in Chicago eats deep dish pizza. That it's only there for the tourists. That might be true, but I was a tourist at the moment. I arrived at Pequod's at 11:30am on a weekday and this place was packed within 40 minutes. This was exactly what I was looking for coming to town to experience some local pizza. I love deep dish, well I love pizza and deep dish being a type. Pequod's is everything. The slightly dive bar ambiance and awesome staff add to it's brilliance. The brilliance being their pizza. Perfect quantity and flavored sauce balances the amount of cheese on the pie. The cheese is brought right to the edge of the pan and then forms the best cheese crust around the edges. The bit everyone wants from the lasagna pan. This touch was so great I ate these slices sideways. Adding to the balance was the crunchy crust slightly between the famous places in town holding this beast up. Perquod's is really how I would like to eat for a visit. Something that is authentic; place, people and food. I wish I had more time and appetite to have sought out more of these types of places while in town, but there is always next time. Pequod's will keep me coming back.",12,0,positive
2827,"Pretty darn good deep dish if you ask me! I've been to Gino's as well but I think this place takes the cake. The burned cheese is everything that a cheese lover such as myself could ask for, and the staff is friendly and very well versed in the pizza cutting world.",5,1,positive

2829,Worse service I have ever experienced in my life! NEVER coming back here me and my boyfriend got seated within 1 hour and 30 minutes when we first of called in and she said we would get seated right away and then we get there and they tell us something different. We had to complain and asked to speak to a manager right when we said we want to speak to a manager the host (which was a guy I don't remember the name) got scared and goes ok I'll get you seated right now. He had people go in that we're after us and goes to show you he isn't playing it right. Our waitress literally only took our order and Never came back to check up on us we were confused on who our waitress was. The pizza also took another hour. Just HORRIBLE I rather go to Lou mantis and not have a bad experience with better pizza. They definitely need a whole new management of how they run the system because I honestly never such bad experience.,5,5,negative
2830,"Terrible customer service. Ordered a pizza via telephone. Was told it would be ready in an hr. When I went in to pick up the pizza, I was told that the girl manning the pick up orders was not at her station but she would be back soon (apparently nobody else can help you). After waiting 15 mins for her, she finally took my name and payment. Instead of going straight back and getting the pizza or sending someone else, she took everyone else's name and payment before getting all of our pizzas. The whole process took 30 mins. When I finally got my pizza, it was tepid. This was my first and last experience with Pequods. GO TO LOU MALNATIS! The pizza and service is so much better!",2,1,negative

2837,"I had the exquisite opportunity to experience my first Pequods sausage/ pepperoni Pan Pizza. My co-workers and I opted for a carry out for a lunchtime treat and, as expected, the pie was hot and gorgeous upon opening of the somewhat weighted box. My chosen wedge was placed upon a non-coated paper plate which was supplied as a request for plates and plastic utensils, seeing that we were in the workplace we obviously were in need of supplicatory devices to enjoy our meal. ( these plates were like a cruel joke ) My first taste of Pequods pan was indeed delicious. No doubt about that. The pepperoni was a cured spicy beautifully thin sliced enjoyment, but my thoughts on the sausage were less rated. It tasted more of a pork breakfast sausage then a pizza ingredient. The cheese rimmed crust, Pequods signature style,  was okay. It tasted of a well seasoned cast iron vessel which in turn thrust me into the history of the brand. I personally did not care for that taste of history.Pan style has never been my forte, too much bread and definitely not enough cheese and very little sauce. So all in all, I cannot rank my satisfaction high, although hunger satisfying, I would not indulge again. I am truly just a deep dish and ultimate thin crust girl. With such a strong following, Pequods reigns supreme . Just not for me.FYI: the crust in nothing at all like Lou's which I read in a prior review and this is NOT DEEP DISH pizza. It is PAN PIZZA. Huge difference.",15,4,negative

Sausage as a topping, not inside under the gooey cheese? Such things  should only be done if it is a thin crust. Very doughy. Yea, the $5 lunch special with beer is a delicious option. But even at that price, I might be tempted to pick up a beer and go to Art of Pizza for their slice. Skip.",1,1,negative
2846,MMM mmmm! Finally came here after hearing about it from lots of people- it hasn't disappointed. I have only had the pan pizza- and that cheese crust is SO good.

We had some beers at the bar and put in our order with the hostess stand; the pizzas take like 30-45 minutes to make, so it's smart to put in an advance order.This was my first authentic Chicago-style pizza (Uno's doesn't count), and it's enough to make me question Jon Stewart's epic NYC-versus-Chicago-Deep-Dish rant. Maybe it IS an above-ground marinara swimming pool, but encased into an impossibly crispy pan crust and loaded down with so much cheese and sausage and olives and mushrooms. Quite the dramatic presentation when the server thunks it down on the table. A small pizza was too much food for the two of us. I still dream about this place.",5,3,positive

The burnt cheese crust is as great as everyone says it is, but I have some qualms based on my own personal taste.My favorite deep dish will always be Gino's East based on their crust alone. Buttery, dense, never too thick, and slightly sweet from the cornmeal they use. This crust was good, although slightly too thick and fluffy, making it taste like pizza bread rather than pizza.But that's just due to my personal bias, and my bias aside, Pequod's makes a decent pie.",8,3,negative
2862,"Went a few months back and never got around to reviewing.Probably the best pizza I've ever had and I've had most of them.  The restaurant was really cool.My only disclaimer is that if you don't like things a little burnt, this may not be your favorite pizza.  The cheese is burnt, er I mean 'caramelized'.  But I love that.",4,0,positive
2863,We ordered a pizza for delivery and the order was wrong / the delivery driver had no change thus making it difficult to give her a tip . The pizza was doughy / it looked like a mess when we opened the box . The charred crust was tasty but that was about it . Gino's and Lou's much better in my opinion . What a disappointment - maybe it's better dining in but delivery was not good,4,3,negative
2864,"Definitely worth the (probably insane) wait to get a table. The pizza is delicious and so much better than other places. I love the carmelized cheese crust. Plus, it's across the street from the Webster Place theater, so it's great to go out for pizza and a movie.",5,1,positive
2865,"Hands down, this is the BEST PIZZZA IN CHICAGO. Don't let anyone tell you different. I always bring out of town guests here to have a true pizza experience that can't be found anywhere else. The pizzas are well worth the wait, and the crust is a sure fire winner.",3,0,positive
2866,wow. the deep dish is really something to write home about the front of house staff is pretty crappy though,2,1,positive
2867,Great place - authentic Chicago deep dish!Really nice place to chill out on the weekends.,2,1,positive
2868,"I didn't LOVE it. People said it was the best deep dish but it claims to just be pan but I'd still say my fav is Lou's, The crust is yummy but I wasn't blown away. Also, the garlic cheesy bread and fries were whatever too. It was really good service and we were able to get seated right away at 6 but when we were leaving there was quite a wait. I probably won't be back but glad I checked it out.",5,1,negative
2869,"Lou Malnati's and Giordano's are supposed to be the best deep dish in Chicago for tourists, and Pequod's is supposed to be the best deep dish in Chicago for locals, or so I hear. I used to live in Chicago for a couple years and while I tried the more touristy places, I had never been to Pequod's until a recent return trip to Chicago.A group of us stopped by for a late weekday lunch and opted for their special. Their $5 personal pizza and drink special is a good deal, but I think I just don't like their style of pizza. I prefer the thinner crust of traditional deep dish (I think of it as a thin plate with lots of sauce/cheese) vs. Pequod's which had a very thick and chewy crust which I hadn't expected. The extra thick crust made the already heavy pizza feel even heavier to me, and I'm just not a fan.Dining here just made me crave Lou's more :( It's just not my preference, and while the pizza is solid, I don't think I'd return in the future since there are better deep dish options.",8,0,negative
2870,"Pequod's has my favorite chicago style pizza. Their crust is perfection. It's buttery and light without being soggy which I often find to be a problem with some deep dish pizzas. The servers are great and friendly. On one occasion I did run into a host that seemed to be a bit of a ditz but besides that, the service is good.",5,0,positive
2871,While visiting Chicago I asked a group Chicago's best (under cover police) who had the best deep dish pizza in the city - Pequod's!  I was not disappointed. Service was good and the sauce had a great flavor.,4,1,positive
2872,"Went to Pequod's for the first time and I must say the pizza was good. It has a crispy texture to it that I really enjoyed. The appetizer platters were run of the mill type but the sauces were rather tasty.  I must admit between the crowds and rude servers I won't be rushing back anytime soon. It was my son's 30th birthday and everything was sort of thrown at us. We had to serve ourselves, pour our own waters, get our own napkins, and the waitress didn't stop by to ask us how we were doing. We had to get the manager to get us another round of drinks. No birthday wishes or offers of a type of dessert. She was pretty much running on fumes and didn't want to bother doing anything else for us. So waiting for over an hour to be seated in a jammed packed place with servers giving us stink eye, difficult parking and spending $5.95 for a Miller Light, I think there are other places that have comparable pizza,professional/ cordial servers, with plenty of parking.",3,5,negative
2873,"This review is on pizzas that we ordered for delivery.  I've never had pequod's, but have heard great things about it.  When I ordered around 11:45, I was quoted 1 hour and 20 min. Totally understandable for a Sunday afternoon.  When I called after 1 hour 45 min,  making sure the address was correct, they said the delivery guy was close and it should be there within a few minutes. I called again after 2 and a half hours, and they called the delivery guy again. He was finally at our street, almost a full hour after the quoted time. Pizza was okay, but not very hot anymore. The deep dish was not as saucy as I would have liked. Thin was better, in my opinion. Maybe it tastes better to eat the pizza in the restaurant, but would not order again for delivery.",7,0,negative
2874,"The only thing that makes this pizza good is the carmelized edge.  Other than that it's like eating a big doughy cake disguised with cheese and red sauce.  They did put up with us tourists changing our reservation multiple times, so extra points for their patience.",3,0,positive
2875,I ordered a 12 inch Peperoni & onion pan pizza. The crust is really thick and tastey. The 12 inch is the perfect size for two hungry people...just enough for leftovers :P only downside was that we had to wait an hour and fifteen minutes but it was so good and so worth the wait! You know what they say.. you have to wait for the best things in life amirite?! FIVE STARS! Go pequods!,5,1,positive
2876,My favorite deep-dish Pizza. The sausage is the way to go. Plus it's nice that they will deliver both to my work and home... neither of which are exactly close to the restaurant.,3,0,positive
2877,"Good deep dish but inconsistent. Came here once and it was incredible and balanced. Came again and it was mostly bread. Have had the same happen in the 4-5 times I've been or gotten delivery. If they were more consistent, might be one of the best in Chicago.",4,1,negative

2880,"This place has really gone downhill.  4-5 years ago it was great but the quality has gone way down.  We went in for a table and it was a 2 hour wait!  I got my buzzer and they told me it would only work at their ""new bar"" the Whale tale""... I always go next door to The Drinkingbird.  They have half priced Draft beers on Sunday's!  Pequods told me the buzzer wouldn't work there (lie). The people that work there are great but pizza quality went down and they try to get you to pay $7 for a bud light at their new spot when I can get a good beer next door for cheaper!  Don't know why they would disrespect their neighbors!  Going to Lou's for now on",7,2,negative

TOTALLY GREAT PIZZA though, but if you like crust, like me, this probably isn't your jam. my bf LOVED it. and like I said, great pizza! their crust is crunchy and carmalized, so if that sounds good to you, you should go! PLUS its a blackhawks bar!",6,0,negative
2884,"Great pizza near the wrigleyille area. The best part of this pizza is the crust, they cook it till it Browns on top I think it's the cheese crusting on it but it's sop good. In comparison to the other Chicago pizza I have had on my vacation, this place is less cheese than Giordano's, peqouds is more tomato saucy. The crust is crispy that other places but has a sweet taste similar to Gino's East. I definitely recommend trying this place. It's also a chill bar to drink in and watch a game. It's a Blackhawks bar.",5,1,positive

2887,"Gets busy and the pan pizzas take time so plan ahead. I like the option to do toppings to just half of the pizza to get variety. We opted for Canadian bacon and pineapple on one side, and pepperoni and green peppers on the other side. The crust is Carmelized and so so good. We ordered a medium which was 6 huge slices. It was way too much. I'd like to come back and try the thin crust. That looked good also. Service was friendly.",6,0,positive

2892,"I came to Pequod's because I was visiting Chicago and heard it was THE place to get Chicago deep dish pizza. After waiting over an hour to to be seated, we placed our order and got a salad, some garlic bread, and the deep dish pizza with various toppings. Our appetizers came out fast but the pizza took over an hour to come. The reason for the two stars was that they totally messed up our order. The toppings we wanted were all wrong. I was tempted to correct the order but thought the new pizza might take another hour to come and we were starving, having waited for two hours. I did not find the pizza we did get very good. This was my first deep dish experience so maybe I just don't like deep dish but I found the pizza to be bland- bread with a ton of bland sauce, a little cheese and a mountain of toppings I didn't want. I heard I should try Giordano's so will the next time I visit Chicago. I think this place might be a little overrated.",4,2,negative
2893,"WOW is all I can say. This place is amazing. I grew up in Chicago and have had pizza from all the best places, at least I thought so until last night. We had a small group of 3 couples and everyone (2 Canadians and 4 Chicagoans) thought this was the best pizza we have ever had.  We tried a Deepdish and a thin crust. While I prefer a thinner, thin crust the crust was amazing. The deep dish had the caramelized crust which was a first for us all, and we thought it was really good.Our server was just as good as the pizza, friendly and attentive.",9,0,positive

2899,"Excellent, excellent pizza. The sausage is to die for. The restaurant is busy and it will take some time for your food. Luckily, they have Goose Island Green Line on tap to help you pass the time. The pizza is very filling, I'd suggest not filling up on Appetizers before hand. They will happily box up leftovers, and proper Chicago pizza  should always be reheated in an oven, not the microwave! Highly recommended, just try to avoid the busiest times.",4,1,positive
2900,"Came to Chicago to stuff my face and see the sights and ended up in flavor town.I'd heard about this spot and had to give it try since they specifically bake it with cheese on top to give it a nice crunch! I made the long trek from Millennium Park ( yes, i was being touristy...sue me :P ) to a neighborhood that put the urban in suburban and plopped my hungry hungry hippo a$$ down in this bad boy.  My friend and I were immediately greeted by a cute waitress and offer drinks (+1) We ordered up some some local brews and and a shared a medium Pepperoni, Sausage, & Mushroom pie. Th wait was about 20 minutes, in the meantime we watched as local after local came through, and perused their decor. Cools dive bar-ish like feel without the same crowd..and smell ^.^ The pizza was came out piping hot and overloaded with toppings! The real coup de grace was the delectable crispity crunchy blackened lasagna-like (in a good way!!) cheesy crust!I wolfed down 3 slices and called it quits...I would have loved to sit around for another beer or two and finish off the rest, but all good things must come to an end. Plus I had reservations for L20, but that's a different story and review all together.",10,4,positive
2901,"I can't believe the wait time for this place. I used to come here back in the day and be seated immediately for my deep dish cravings. Regardless, it's the only place I'll come for deep dish when visiting Chicago. I think their service is really great for how swamped they are on a consistent basis. Their appetizers aren't much to write home about - but I'll usually get the fried zucchini so I can nosh on something while I wait 50 minutes for my Pizza.",2,2,positive

Simple pepperoni pie was prefect;  and Italian beef with fresh basil (ordered on a whim) was delicious. I could not grant the final star, because of the wait staff.  Impersonal,  inattentive,  and  unknowledgeable (about the freshness/quality of ingredients)... overall poor individual job done.If anyone for the establishment is reading,  please note: Iced tea should be more than just brown-colored water.",2,2,positive

Over two hours later we told them to forget it and to box it up. ""Oh, it's another 18 to 20 minutes."" Whatever, we've waited this long. And then there it is. The illustrious pizza we've waited an entire evening for. Boxed in all its glory. Now three hours in the making. ""Excuse me, can I speak to a manager?"" ""Why, what for?"" ""I've been waiting a very long time for this pizza that I'm pretty sure doesn't exist. Everyone around us has come and gone, all with pizza.""

The best way to describe it is the ""anti-Malnati's"" The pizza is just as good (maybe even better) but the atmosphere is much less ""corporate"" with a well worn interior, t-shirts of the restaurant's mascot hanging for sale behind the bar (I think it's a whale, Lord I hope it's a whale because if it's not, I am officially concerned) and a straight view into the kitchen. Lou would never stand for such frivolity!I had a sausage pizza and it was awesome. Thick crust, perfectly done, with a nice layer of burnt cheese around the edge. A great tomato sauce and thick gooey cheese. Well worth the wait.The lunch special of a personal pizza and either draft beer (Bud Light) or soda for $5 is insane. Seriously what is wrong with you people!?Then again, it was the perfect ploy as I wanted to try it so I used the lunch special as my entree into Pequod's.

The pizza really lacks in the cheese department - I had to put a bunch of Parmesan on it, which I never do. We went at about 5:30pm on a Friday and didn't have to wait for a table. But the kitchen somehow messed up our order, so they gave us a free app and round of drinks, which was considerate.  Ended up probably waiting 45 mins at least from order to getting our pizza, but was no biggie.

If your experience is like mine, upon arrival your name will not be listed on the sheet the host/ess pulls from as tables clear, and you'll wait over two hours to finally secure a table you thought you reserved days prior. I have no idea why a restaurant would hinder itself with a ""preferred"" list if its guests must remind them that they called ahead. I say do away with ""preferred"" altogether and seat first come first serve. That way all the suckers like me, apparently, would be saved the trouble of planning their meal around a restaurant that can't deliver. Their preferred process creates a false sense of hope that you'll actually get seated at your agreed time.",4,3,negative

The portion was plenty for 4 people. Everyone was stuffed. The crust was delicious. Nothing like what I've eaten before. The first few bites were very good, but it got really salty after the first few bites. It was likely because the pepperoni that was piled on. There was at least 2 layers of pepperoni.

2940,"I usually love deep dish pizza, and good service...but received none of that.I understand that waiters and waitresses level of service can vary upon locations, but this one was pretty bad.  We got our orders taken and nearly 40 minutes passed until we got checked up on.  And the only reason why she stopped by was because our pizza was finished.  So we bite into our pizza to find out that the inside was cold, not warm or room temp, but cold.  The pizza looked like it had ingredients globbed on and there was no firm structure like Lou's.  It would just fall apart and in part, probably due to the uncooked factor.Save your money, Lou's, Giordano's, and Gino's are where you want to eat.",6,4,negative

Personal preference coming through but I knew as soon as my pizza was set in front of me I wouldn't fully enjoy it. The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me and I do not like ""green things"" in my sauce. I promise I am not 2 years old, I just think the best sauce is simple - san marzano tomatoes, garlic, salt, and pepper. The other thing I thought was missing was layers! I like the deep dish formula where you do cheese, sauce, cheese, sauce and the one layer on Pequod's variation just didn't do it for me!You can't beat the price on the lunch special, even though I didn't even eat half it was a good value.",10,2,negative

No thanks.  The bottom of the crust was more bread like (fluffy) and not crispy than what I've had from other pizzerias.However, service was top notch. Everyone was very friendly.

2957,"Best deep dish in Chicago, and one of the Chicago spots I miss most since moving out west.  It takes forever, as good deep dish tends to, but Pequod's takes waiting to another level. Luckily there are some ways to get around this: a) arrive early, or go on a weeknight; or if there's a wait, put your name in and b) head to the co-owned bar up the street for drinks and appetizers or c) hang by the bar in Pequod's and grab a brew while you wait.  I've done both b) and c) and recommend b) because you can actually sit down, and the wait can stretch up to 2hrs. After you brave the gauntlet of waiting, being seated, and deciding what you want to order, the pizzas are hefty and delicious--two mediums will feed four hungry adults and there will still likely be leftovers. It's not a sports bar but there are some TVs which was great for watching the Cubbies in the NLDS one night I went. Love Pequod's!",5,2,positive

2974,"The caramelized cheese on the crust for the pan pizza is magical. This is one of the best pies in Chicago. Absolutely delicious. Pequod's delivers. And that is fantastic. However, the problem is that they take this magical pizza and put it in a styrofoam clamshell and then put that clamshell in a plastic bag, which they tie tightly at the top. By the time you get the delivery, it is a soggy mess inside a plastic bag wet with condensation. I've asked them to simply box the pizza, but they won't.

2977,"If  Michelangelo (Ninja Turtles) could write a review about pizza this would be one of them. Where to begin? I have been going to Pequod's for the past 10 years.  I love two types of pizza Thin Crust and Pan.  This review is based on Pan pizza. Nowhere have I tried a better Pan pizza other than Pequod's. Their Thin crust pizza is not as great as their Pan,  I would say mediocre to any other Mom and Pops shop.  Moving forward with their Pan pizza you can expect a HIT OR A MISS. By this I mean they're not always consistent. I've been going to this place so often that I know when they get their ingredients right on cue. Sometimes, they add too much cheese, other times they overwhelm you with water down sauce. Even so, when they do get it right all I could say is COWABUNGA! The infused  burned cheese with the sweet crunch crust touching that flavorful tomato sauce that makes my friend Leonardo scream WICKED AWESOME! Moving forward, this place can get hectic. Every time I go I always have hours to spare so I don't mind the wait.  Having some beers while waiting is the norm. Appetizers are 7/10 nothing special, but great to kill some time. I rather stick to the pizza and beers. Staff are most of the time attentive. I see how they can become agitated by all the customers, but work with them and they'll work with you. Like I said if you come to this place don't expect to have that perfect pan pizza all the time. I heard from friends that their second location is better than the Chicago location. Can't say for sure. All I can say for this location is that  if they happen to get it right ""Bravo"" you have finally tried a bite of heaven my friend.",15,3,positive

Now, call me crazy but I liked burnt cheese (and so did others with me) so we didn't mind so much, but others may. Good amount of cheese + sauce + toppings. I took away a star mostly because it seems as though they are trying to copy Lou Malnati's butter crust, but it's not quite there that the flavor falls flat. Chicago style pizza is all about the crust and if you mess that up, it's kind of a fail. I would probably order Lou's over this, but wouldn't hate going back either.",4,4,positive

It's also not that greasy which is a bonus for me. Unfortunately the service last time was a little hit or miss. We showed up with a group of 5 around 4:30 and they clearly didn't know how to handle it. Two tables pushed together?  Cram us in a big booth?  They couldn't figure it out.

Finally, the pizza was out of balance:  too much sauce, not enough meat (canadian bacon).  The flavor of the toppings individually was actually pretty good, but the ""pizza"" did not come together as a coherent whole.  Not sure why people like this place.  Maybe it's the dining in experience?",5,1,negative

After inquiring about our pizza to our waitress after an hour and fifteen minutes passed, she checked on the order and shrugged when returning to our table. Certainly not her fault. Then we asked to see the manager. He took around 10 minutes to arrive at our table. In the meantime, our MEDIUM THIN CRUST pizza arrived. People who arrived after us and were seated received their deep dish well before we did. The manager came to our table and just gave us an uncaring ""sorry"" which seemed a well rehearsed line.  We weren't looking for a free anything but he tried to say that we must have been told the 50 minute wait when the wait time was just changing????  Sincerity and customer appreciation is definitely missing. They have these kind of waits all the time and can't anticipate the timing just yet? Goodbye Pequod's. There are plenty of pizza joints just as good if not better in the City.",5,3,negative
3017,"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, hands down!  If you want FLAVOR, with great crust, NOT over loaded with cheese, check this place out.  The sauce is awesome not sweet, has a tang...full of flavor; the crust is sturdy and crisp on the bottom, and a soft pillow on top; not too much cheese and the cheese creeps up the the edge and caramelizes -- wow is this fantastic!  Top it with sausage and pepperoni -- yum!",9,1,positive

3019,Best Pizza in the Chicagoland area hands down!! Always saw my friends on Facebook post pictures and statuses about how this was the best place in Chicago to get pizza. Well they were right!!Went to this place on a Saturday. And it was packed!! The restaurant itself has a bar look to it. Definitely recommend ordering pick-up or delivery unless you don't mind waiting for 30-50 minutes to be seated and then having to probably wait for your pizza. Overall the pizza hit the spot! I definitely will come back and order from this place for future pizza cravings. Forget that weak stuff like Papa Johns.,4,1,positive

3033,"Not bad, but doesn't meet the hype.  A 2.5 star rating would be perfect, but I rounded it up for them.I ordered the recommended specialty here: Large, pan pizza with sausage for carry out.  The order was ready when I arrived at exactly the quoted time, on a busy Saturday night around 9pm, during a Hawks' game.It seems watching the Hawks here would be a good idea.The pizza: it wasn't bad, but it sure was a lot of bread.  The ""carmelized"" crust is more like burned cheese crust, but I actually enjoyed that quite a bit.  The sausage chunks are excellent, with even a hint of sweetness to them.  However, the bottom line is that the sauce and cheese don't have enough flavor to match other famous Chicago pizza places. I tossed some crushed red pepper and parmesan on top and the flavor improved greatly.  It is a good deal too, unlike Art of Pizza or Gino's. I'd go here again if I'm not feeling Lou's or Piece, which for me are much better.  I will have to go and check out the original creator's small place up in Morton Grove sometime.",14,5,negative

The pizza isn't much more than a huge piece of bread.  It looked delicious when brought to our table and when we were served the first slice it had the gooey cheesy look you see in all the pictures on this Yelp page.  A few minutes in however, we realized we were eating nothing but a large crust with a thin slice of cheese on top and a smattering of sauce.  The sauce is very good and the carmelized crust  has a terrific texture to it.  It's very light in the middle with a crunchy bottom, but there's not much more to report.  My wife loves pizza and was very disappointed given all the rave reviews of this place on Yelp.The overwhelming crust and scant toppings got so bad that by the second slice she had stopped biting into the pie and turned it sideways so she would only get half the dough along with the cheese and sauce.  I went back to the initial website I saw that named Pequod's as one of Chicago's 'eight best pizzas' and realized that they recommended it be ordered with extra cheese and extra sauce.  I have to say that is pretty much spot on.  Ordering their pie any other way gets you nothing more than focaccia bread.   I should have checked that site before we went.   We plan to try maybe one more of these north side pizza places so many people gush about and that'll be all.  For the time being however, the next time we go out for deep dish, it will be to one of the mainstays, (Lou Malnati's, Uno's or Due's downtown, Giordano's in Hyde Park, etc.)We took home half of the pizza and never even bothered to reheat the leftovers; we forgot all about them, then tossed it.",10,6,negative

Pequods pizza out of all the pizza places I tried while I was in Chicago was the best hands down. What made it so fucking good was that there pepperoni had a nice quality feel to it and sauce was incredible. But the real kick in the teeth was the caramelization at the end of the piece of pizza. That was like the desert. I cant even begin to explain how good that was. It was so good that we went 2 days in a row to Pequods. I also learned that you can ask for extra caramelization so when I come back to Chi town you can find me in Pequads drinking a ice cold pale ale. CHEERS",9,3,positive

3049,"I have been coming here for the last several years, it's a great deal for lunch, a personalized pan pizza and a drink for 4.95.I know that it takes at least 20 mins to prepare a pizza, especially at lunch, so I call my order in ahead of time, knowing what I want.  After years of eating  the pan pizza here, I wanted to try the thin crust pizza, so I ordered a thin 12"" sausage (also knowing there would be leftovers) and my wife ordered her usual lunch special, the pan, spinach pizza.We arrive within 15 mins, the food does not get to our table for another 20 mins, first time this has ever happened ..(was my order put in when I called?  I don't think so.)My wife's Pizza was it's usual fine self, good crust and all that as you can see from other reviews, this time not enough caramelized crust though in my opinion.What they pass off as thin crust pizza is not thin crust at all. They should just call it their regular pizza, lots of dough, too much for me to be called thin crust, it was OK, not what  I expected though.The server, who I  have seen there on many visits was busy.  She got some help from some of the male staff that were just looking for something to do.  Part of my wife's deal was a drink with her pizza, but the charge for refills was not explained, might have been on the menu, but we ordered on the phone), OK I guess, but the waitress asked my wife if she wanted some more diet coke, the glass was 1/4 full grabbed the glass refilled it and charged us 2.50 for that!  The manager took the 2.50 off the tab, which was about the tip for the meal anyway...(little less)  Bottom line: They need more staff for lunch service, explain charges, make a thin crust pizza, rename what you now call thin crust to regular pizza. It really reminded me of Chucky Cheese, which is sad.I will come back, but it is going to be at least 6 months or more for me.I need to give this place a rest.",5,0,negative
3050,"Stop #4 on my ""Eating my way through Chicago/St. Louis and possibly doing other things on this trip Summer Tour 2011"" found me finally at some deep dish pizza.  Another recommendation from my friend.  It is all about the crust at Pequod's.  Yum freakin' yum.Another place you will wait in line for.  The friend that I was staying with hadn't heard of Pequod's.  I was hoping we were in for a treat.  The beauty of Pequod's is that they will take your pizza order while you wait to be seated.  Deep dish usually takes a while to cook, so ordering it while you have yet to sit is a really nice thing for them to do.Once seated, we started out with the Appetizer Combo which was a bunch of fried things like mozzarella sticks, zucchini, poppers and mushrooms.  It was ok.  Fried is fried.  You can't really do a terrible job at frying things.  I was ready for the pizza.We had the pan pizza with onions and pepperoni.  The pizza is baked in cast iron pans blackened by decades of seasoning and the overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.  If that doesn't sound good to you, what does?  This is not a pizza for the faint of heart.  Deep dish is heavy and we didn't see anyone leaving the restaurant without a to go bag.  We ended up taking a good portion home and I had a slice 2 days later.  Still tasted really good.There are a ton of pizza shops in Chicago.  Everyone has a favorite.  If I lived here I can see Pequod's being a favorite for years and years.",9,4,positive

3060,"Finally I've tried the pizza that my friends have been raving about!  I've had a lot of deep dish in the last few weeks, trying to find the best in town for my English boyfriend.  Together we've had Uno's, Lou Malnati's, and Gino's East - of course I've tried Giordano's too.  Some better than others, but I don't think he ever got what the fuss was about with Chicago style deep dish.  Too bad he left before I came here!On a warm, sunny Saturday, the place was pretty busy with a 30 minute wait around 6:45 pm.  You'd do well to order while you wait since the pizzas can take 45 minutes or more to make.  We waited outside on the bench facing Clybourn, until our buzzer finally went off and we went to our booth - the place is bigger than it looks, with two floors and several rooms.  The atmosphere was a lot like a neighborhood bar - lively and fun, with TVs playing the game and lots of people drinking and laughing.We started with a pitcher of Blue Moon, the first of two, and after about 45 minutes in the oven our spinach-and-sausage pizza came to the table.  The server cut the first slices, and the hot cheese stretched high - so appetizing!  Unlike a lot of deep dish, this pizza doesn't taste greasy or heavy.  Sure it's a lot of food, but it tastes almost fresh.  The spinach was abundant, the sausage had to be homemade - it was full of flavor and spices.  The crust stayed crispy the whole time, never getting weighed down by sauce and toppings.  My friend pointed out that I'd basically inhaled my first slice - I was hungry, but it was also so delicious I didn't want to take a break!  A large pizza filled three of us (with one piece left over).  Any appetizers would've just filled us up for no good reason so I'm glad we just stuck to pizza.It's not overpriced, the atmosphere is fun, the pizza is great, and it's worth a little wait outside.  I still have love for Lou's and Gino's East, but this is definitely the place to go for Chicago deep dish.",18,6,positive

The restaurant was mostly full, so it was nice that they were working together to take orders. Decent selection of beers with most of the craft beers being local.  Goose Island, Fat Tire, Bell's... can't really go wrong there.  The house salad is not your typical iceberg lettuce with a few carrot shavings, but a large bowl of leafy greens plus some fixin's.  Great way to start the meal. Now, the thing everyone actually cares about. Pizza! I'm not a deep dish expert, but this is gooooood. Crunchy exterior (I hear they melt cheese on the crust) and soft on the inside. I ordered a personal pan with pepperoncini and mushrooms. It's a 7-inch pan that is supposed to be for one person.

3078,went with a friend cause he said the pizza was amazing.

3081,"When I think of deep dish, my first reaction was Lou Malanati's. Ever since I lived for a year off of Ashland and Fullerton, Pequods has been the picture I see when I hear deep dish. My first experience quite interesting with this place because this is one of the first deep dish pizzas I've ever had. The carmelized crust is something short special but gives this nice crispy finish to the meaty part of the pizza. I dislike the fact that it's a Blackhawks only bar/restaurant but that's how it is in Chicago. They don't give a shit about what type of bar the customer wants. Lol",2,2,positive
3082,"This pizza is big time...yea...you've gotta go try this one if you haven't already.  And then you'll understand.  I'd put this pizza and crust up against any of the so called BIGGIES!  On the 2200 block of Clybourn in the Lincoln Park area, just go...just go!  You won't be disappointed!!!",0,1,positive

3085,"Coming from a girl who isn't  big pizza eater (or eater of any other carbs for that matter), the pizza here was surprisingly AMAZING. I was afraid to be disappointed in this ""DEEP DISH"" pizza that Chicago is known for (much due to my own personal preferences) but I was blown away at how delicious and texturally fabulous this DEEP dish pizza was. The crust is caramelized, so when you cut into it, you can feel the crispy crust breaking underneath your knife. The crust is crispy and topped with fresh cheeses, meats and veggies. The pizza must be eaten with a knife and fork BTW. The toppings (they recommend no more than 7 so that the pizza cooks thoroughly) are fresh and are lightly tossed on the deep dish pizza so that it is light and airy. Only reason why I avoid pizza is because the dough is dense and I feel overly stuffed after a single slice. The pizza here doesn't leave me feeling that way and I'm full after two slices sans caloric guilt.The place is open late and me being a spontaneous procrastinator entered with only 15 minutes left on the clock. We ordered a pizza and it was on our table in 10 mins. Large size pizza ($35 with tax and tip) split amongst 5 people and we (and our taste buds) were all satisfied. This is my first taste of deep dish pizza in Chi Town and I am absolutely blown away as to how delicious this was. I am very glad it was my first meal in the windy city. I can't wait to come back for more Pequods!!!",9,5,positive
3086,"I hate to say it but yeah definitely experienced better.  We went to Pequod's for deep dish last Saturday and of course had to wait.  After about 30 minutes we were seated at a booth that was broken.  The place itself looks really run down and could definitely use some work.  Our waitress could have been nicer.  She was efficient but not friendly and we think she forgot to put our pizza in because we waited almost an hour for it.  Then once we got it, it wasn't cooked all the way and the crust was chewy.  Overall can't stand up to Lou's and I wouldn't go back.",5,2,negative
3087,This pizza is fabulous.  I love the thin crust and staff.  They are super friendly and are always helpful and observant.  I'm not quite ecstatic for the deep dish pizza but you have to try the thin for sure.

Lately it has gotten worse. The delivery has been late quite a bit lately and today I got a mess of a pizza. It was smashed to one side with a lot of sauce on half the pizza and very little on the other side.

That's why I have 3 slices still in my fridge... If I NEEDED a meal..Yeah, I'd go there. It wouldn't be my first choice..I like more of a balance in my pizza.

3092,"My favorite deep dish in Chicago yet! Pequod's signature crust has crispy cheese spilling over onto the pan, and it's delicious. Lots of topping choices as well. I would recommend getting a small pizza, or multiple small pizzas if you have more people, because the crust is the best part. Salads are also good, and a nice way to spend your time while waiting for the pizza (they're huge).It's more or less a sports bar, but with a very warm, casual atmosphere (and great food, of course). Great service, though of course the deep dish takes a while. There's usually a wait to get in, so plan ahead. You can order your deep dish while you wait if there are no tables, which is definitely a good option--less time waiting for your food once you get a spot.Additional note: I bought a tshirt here and I love it!",11,1,positive

We went last night and we're funneled next door to their new restaurant called whale tale? or something like that: so I guess this is more a review for that place. We were told they had the same pizza etc. Well, while the place was nice on the inside, but The pizza was AWFUL. Not sure how they did it, but managed to burn it on one side and the other side had a bunch of raw tomatoes and mushrooms on it. The pizza was flavorless, which is not the way I remember it. The waiter was super rude; when he asked if we wanted to take it home we said no it was not good, and he scoffed and was like, ""well haven't you had our pizza before."" And he brought it out any way and acted like we were dumb because we didn't like the pizza.",9,3,negative

I had heard so many raves about how this places measures up against Gino's and Giordano's and Uno's and Lou Malnatti's. No. We ordered a small pan pizza with green peppers, onions, sausage, and mushrooms. First thing, when I order pizza, I expect the toppings cooked. Maybe 10% of the veggies were soft enough to be considered somewhat cooked. And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't pizza toppings supposed to be incorporated in the pizza somehow? We literally got a crust with cheese and tons of raw toppings thrown on top, RAW. I got several huge chunks of pepper half the size of my hand on my slice. It was a salad with a cheesy crust. I will say the sausage was cooked, though. At least there's that. I was highly disappointed. I was expecting something close to pizza nirvana and I was severely let down. It wasn't even a pizza I would ever crave or want again. I came, I ate, I won't return.",5,3,negative

We love going there before/after seeing a movie at the theater across the street. We've had times that we've gone when the wait was an hour and there's also been times where we walk right in. If it's about a 25-30 minute wait it's no problem to sit at the bar and grab a drink,Their pizza is AMAZING. It's the perfect mix of sauce and cheese and the crust is delicious.

3122,"The caramelized crust is a layer of burnt cheese around the edges of the pie and provides an amazing, unforgettable flavor (think of burnt cheese on baked ziti) with a crunchy/chewy texture.  The crust (dough part) itself is buttery, slightly chewy, but also a bit crunchy.  Delicious.  Additionally, this deep dish pie provides a better balance of cheese and toppings to crust - about 60/40 crust to topping, which is different from the normal 30/70 crust to topping ratio you see at other places.  In short, tasty and filling, but not overwhelming.I like this place better than Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Gino's East.  Definitely a must try if you are in the market for an amazing deep dish pie.Pictures / reviews here:  thegluttonousjd.com/2011…",6,0,positive

We could not have been more wrong. This is HANDS DOWN THE BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO. From the caramel ones crust to the fresh ingredients and amazing sauces, their pizza is unbeatable.

3136,"So yes, there are 1200+ reviews, with the average being 4 stars. We know it's  really, REALLY good pizza. But as a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I find myself frustrated with the many ill-informed reviews I read about our city's pizza. So I feel it's necessary to give my two cents on the matter to clarify the situation. Consider this your Chicago Style Pizzas 101. Beginning with the following:Pequod's is NOT -- I repeat -- NOT Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza. People assume that because the sauce is on top and it's cooked in a deep black pan, it must be deep dish. Well, that's incorrect. There are three types that are often labeled as ""Deep Dish"" which, while true they're all cooked in a ""deep dish,"" only one of those types actually qualifies as ""Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza. The difference is really about the crusts. A Chicago Style Deep Dish's crust is not overly thick and not really bready, but more like a pie crust (buttery, flaky). It often has an outer crust that's elevated above the rest of the dough, as if it were saying ""I am your master. WORSHIP ME.""  Examples are Gino's East and Lou Malnati's. Giordano's, Edwardo's and Art of Pizza are Stuffed Pizzas -- usually a similar crust as the deep dish, but they all have a really thin layer of dough on top of all of the toppings, which is covered with sauce (the sauce doesn't come in actual contact with most of the toppings in the prep, other than a small hole in the middle of it).Pequod's is PAN pizza. Yes, akin to Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza -- thick, bready-inside, slightly crispy-outside crust cooked in a pan. And that's where the similarities end.Because I've already written a mini-non-fiction here, I will be brief: Pequod's was a breath of fresh air to my tastebuds and could evolve to my new favorite place to get a 'Za in the city, Everything was balanced, and that carmelized cheese edge --- ohhhh man....The wait for a table and for our pizza was long, but as the old adage goes, ""Good things come to those who wait.""If I want deep dish, I'm going to Lou's. Stuffed? Giordano's is my place. But for pan pizza, Pequod's has no equal.",8,3,positive
3137,"The best Deep Dish in Chicago! Off the beaten path but well worth the trip! Weird location, weird building, weird space overall. Best crust! I'm not a fan of deep dish typically. I can eat this all day!",3,2,positive
3138,"Not one of the big 3 names in deep dish, which rhyme with Moredanos, Dino's Yeast or Poo Pal Dotties.  But #1 in my book!  Pequod's is a place I've driven past many many times, and never bothered to even give it a second glance.  It's kind of like that girl you went to high school with who was always wearing paint-stained overalls with glasses and a side ponytail, and who you always knew existed but didn't want to talk to?  Eating Pequod's pizza is akin to said girl removing glasses, taking down the pony tail and getting into that skanky prom dress, you never knew, did you?  Now that I know, I get these really weird cravings for the crust at odd hours during the day.  Standing in an elevator.  Gotta have that crust.Doing paperwork at work.  Wish I was typing on a piece of Pequod's.Driving home.  Wish my seat belt was made of Pequod's so I could just lower my jaw and nibble on the belt.The best thing about Pequod's is the lunch special.  $4.95 is all a slice of heaven costs, along with a pop/beer.  You get 1 ingredient with your 7"" personal, so make it a good one.  Honestly though, even if you didn't put anything on it, it would be just fine.  The burnt looking thing on the crust?  It's actually quite good.  It's burned(or burnt if you're fancy) cheese that somehow doesn't taste burned, and lends awesome taste and texture to what normally wouldn't be all that great. Even without the burned rim the crust is amazing.  The fact that there isnt a ton of cheese in their pizza also makes this my favorite.  I hate when you're eating deep dish and your slice gets cold, which causes the cheese to seize up into this rubbery disk of dairy.  And every bite you take, you hate yourself more for.  These kind of shenanigans don't happen when you eat Pequod'sMy best friend who used to live here came to visit, along with his girlfriend.  So on our ""Chicago exclusive"" touristy day, Pequod's was where we took them for a late lunch.  My wife got a spinach and tomato personal, and the three of us split a sausage, mushroom and garlic large.  Holy balls.  I've had garlic on pizza before, but this was insane.  When they put the pie onto the whale trivet, the garlic aroma was so overpowering it hit everyone in the face and we all got black eyes.  I LOVE GARLIC.  My mouth is watering as I type these words...Giant chunks of sausage, large pieces of fresh mushroom and minced garlic everywhere, and the crust?  Oh, that crust  And that smelly garlic.  I'm glad I'm married and not looking because I felt like you could smell the pizza on me for three days after the meal.  I guess it didn't help that we had leftovers and I kept topping off my garlic smell level.  Pequod's is the perfect deep dish, for me and my wife at least.  In the 12 years that I've known her, never once has she had a craving for deep dish.  She's a cracker thin crust kind of gal.  Since we've eaten Peaquod's though, it's about a 4 week interval on the deep dish craving.  This fact alone is all you need to know how special Pequod's is.  Now go get some!I'm coming with you...",17,13,positive

3143,"I've loved this place since they opened over 15 years ago and miss the days when you could walk in any day of the week and get a table.  I don't subscribe to the theory that Chicago has a ""best"" pizza because there are simply too many good pizzas out there - not to mention too many types of pizzas.  But I will tell you one thing for sure, of all the pizza I've had (and my cholesterol levels will attest to the fact that I have had a lot), Pequod's is my hands down favorite.  Is it the caramelized cheese? is it the spice blend they put on the top? is it the fresh ingredients? great service? I don't know, but for many many years now I, my extended family and friends have been coming here to celebrate many birthdays, showers, graduations, etc., and will continue to do so until we are able to.  LOVE this place!",8,0,positive
3144,I'm not sure why this place is the rage because I was not impressed by the pizza I got here. The crust is ridiculously thick. It was like eating pizza sauce and some toppings spread thinly over a really thick piece of not-so-great bread. I didn't taste anything extraordinary about the caramelized cheese on the crust either because I didn't even notice it until I read the reviews on Yelp.,3,1,negative
3145,"Let me start with saying I waited until my second visit to write a review. The first time I was there it was during a bears game and was understandably packed. The service was slow, but I dismissed it as a result of the game and it being a weekend night. This time I went back it was quarter to midnight on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded. There were several open tables around us. We ordered the breaded mushrooms as an appetizer, which were good, and placed our pizza order. The waitress was really doing her best and told us it would be about an hour, which was expected. The only thing I can say I didn't like is they were obviously short staffed and we waited for our overworked waitress to bring our check 45 minutes later. Next time I'll order carry out because I still love the pizza.",4,2,negative
3146,Love this place. In my opinion THE BEST deep dish in Chicago. You can't go wrong with the caramelized crust and you can tell the toppings are fresh. A bit of a wait for the pizza (depending on size) but definitely worth the wait. If you got people coming in from outta town you gotta take them here. Sorry Gino's east but the deep dish here is better.,3,1,positive
3147,"I WANT to give this place 4 stars. I went again after my first being just that.. A-Ok. The food was amazing! Amazing. The experience fell short because of the same problem: service. There was a bug issue (which has now been resolved) making the experience very unpleasant and the server, after our complaint, did not seem to care and did nothing nor did she alert management. Long story short after I personally sought out management, they squared things out. Maybe this was a rough night? I thought. I guess not. I go again, and this time (after truly giving this place the benefit of the doubt) bring my entire family flying in from LA. We order, but realize we ordered it wrong so within 2 minutes, we get a hold of the server (There is a 60-minute wait, we figured it wasn't too late to adjust it) She says she will adjust it, does so and returns, and repeats back the order. It is perfect. Unfortunately the pizza that came out was all wrong. 2 large pizzas for a party of 8 with the wrong toppings (neither the old or new order..but a combination of the two). At this point, it's clear there was a mistake and feel partly responsible for changing the order but feel it is still necessary to relay the issue. We eat (we're not waiting another 60 minutes for a re-fire). But know, we alert her immediately. The server says she will check what she inputed into the computer and seems to remember the order being different, she says ""Oh I do remember that..."" She says. Here is the problem. She NEVER returned, apologized, or even spoke about it ever again. We see her again when we're almost finished and we ask for the check. She drops it --what? Really? I ask for a manager and explain what happened. She says she didn't know the whole story and agreed that the server should have followed up. Mistakes happen. That's fine, but own up to the mix up instead of abandoning a table and expecting a 20% tip. (We tipped 15% on the original amount after having a discount..so she ended up getting at least 20% on the updated bill --we're not evil).Oh not to mention, after having everything squared away by the manager, she has another server pick up our bill and answer our gift card questions. So SHE was mad? MAYBE I happened to get two off-nights for these 2 girls, 2 times in a row. But I doubt it.I will probably eat here again because the food is good, and I'm a sucker, but will be doing take-out, or sitting at the bar.Both times management adjusted my bill, which is great but I (like most) do not to out to eat to look for a discount. I seek great service with great food. Why be good when you can be the best?Here is my old review:****I am updating this because on my way out I asked to speak to a manager and Katie helped us out. She assured us that the problem would be fixed by an exterminator the following day. This lets me know that the management staff truly does care about the customer experience! I recommend this place! The food is delicious. I trust that the fruit fly issue will be resolved soon seeing as the great popularity of the business. Thank you Katie and the male manager on shift!",17,12,negative
3148,"The best pizza in Chicago. I love their deep dish as well as their regular (thinnish) pizza. It has a loud, casual bar atmosphere which I happen to like. However, the restaurant should invest in a better take out operation. Anytime I order pizza for pick up the restaurant is so packed it is a hassle just to get to the pick up area. Then I have to ask the other 20 people crowded around the area if they have already paid/checked in with the staff because there is absolutely no organization. While I'm waiting for the pizza to come out I'm constantly bumped into by people who are trying to get to the bar, leaving with their carryout pizza, checking in with the host, ect.",5,3,positive

3155,"Ohhhhhh my goodness. Pequod's has sold me on their caramelized crust, plentiful toppings, and fantastic dough. Also, I was with a big crowd and would never order this on my own...but their thin crust is also good! Contemplating being a little bit healthy? Their Pequod's Salad is delicious! In my mind, Pequod's can do no wrong.The thing that sets Pequod's apart from other deep dish options is their dough and crust. The combo of doughy-ness with the crispy goodness of the crust is unique to any other deep dish I've had. Must have combination: sausage, giardinara, green pepp and onion. Their pepperoni is also pretty fantastic. Word to the wise, if you get a craving during a weekend day when football is on...try to have the craving a few hours before you want to eat. Delivery on a weekend afternoon has been known to take an hour and a half. Cut down on delivery time by picking up or eating in. However, I'd bring if home so you can recline on your couch after consumption without having to waddle out of the restaurant.",10,0,positive
3156,"Heard a lot about this place and always good things about the pizza. The food was worth the trip, the service is what ruined it for us. 4 of us visited on a Sunday night. Wait was only about 10 minutes which was awesome. We ordered one large pan which is definitely enough for 4.I was going to order a beer but she didn't come around again until half an hour later. At that point she told us it would be about 5 more minutes. After 20 additional minutes, almost an hour for one pizza, we were getting curious since tables sat after us had already finished their meals.  Long story short, our pizza had been burnt and they were giving us a discount. That stuff happens, so we were cool with it; I was glad they told us what was going on and offered a discount. But the discount was only $5 and they failed to mention to us that we had ordered premium toppings that were not indicated on the menu.  Food = worth the trip, Service = not so great",8,2,negative
3157,"I can see the barrage of hate mail heading my way...Came to Pequod's based on many recommendations from locals. Maybe the bar was set too high, or I just expected different. The deep dish was pretty good, but 'the best'? Not in my humble opinion.I ordered a personal size pie with spinach, mushrooms, onions and garlic - coincidentally, the toppings of my favorite Californian deep dish combo (yelp.com/biz/little-star…)The pie smelled and looked great. Pequod's marinara sauce was fabulously rich and tomato-ey. Loved that. The caramel crust top was nice - I like burnt cheese and the likes, but was hoping that some sweetness would remain. Ratio of cheese to sauce to topping was pretty good too. The crust... I was expecting butter, or cornmeal, or something else... I frankly don't know. As a lover of carbohydrates I won't go hating on a crust, but it wasn't memorable.Kudos to the staff - they were super nice and quick. Got to love that.Will I come back again? Sure. Not a must visit but definitely not ruled out.",20,3,negative
3158,"Been here several times but this is my first review.  My wife and I love the pizza here.  Best in the city in my opinion.  Their sausage and pepperoni are the best I've ever had.  It was the downfall of my waist line when I found out they delivered to my old neighborhood.  We now live in central Pennsylvania where good pizza does not exist, so any time we are in town this is a place we must stop.",3,1,positive
3159,"Best deep dish in the city or the entire world hands down!!!!!! I love this place and is a go to anytime I crave a deep dish. The cheese crust and endless options to add, I can pile as much on my pizza and not quite break the bank and have food left over as well.",2,1,positive
3160,"Pequod's is a gem. Great pan pizza (slightly different that the typical Chicago Style Deep Dish). The caramelized crust is what makes all the difference. Packed on the weekends, but worth the wait- ask if you can order your pizza while you wait. The lunch combo is hard to beat.",2,1,positive
3161,"Here's the thing, when we first moved to Chicago we were really into this place and took all our visitors from out of town to check it out. Something about the novel idea of the crisped cheese on the crust and the freshness of the tomato sauce helped it to stand out above the other places we tried.Sadly, that is no longer the case. The pie we ordered the other day was bad in the worst way. This is not deep dish pizza, its more of a focaccia (fluffy, sort of cornmeal texture on the bottom) topped with whatever you choose. Think L and B Spumoni Gardens in NY but without all the goodness that place has. Our pizza had the thinnest possible layer of cheese on top of an inch or so of dough, with the tiniest spoonful of sauce spread over it. It was basically like eating a piece of dry focaccia with a burnt crust (yes I know they do the crisped cheese thing, but this time it was just burnt in the worst way).If you are excited about a rather a poorly topped piece of all-filler-no-killer bread, then this is your place. But if you want and actual stuffed pizza done right, go elsewhere. This place is off our list of recommendations for now.",7,3,negative
3162,"I, like most non-native Chicagoans, was enamored with deep dish pizza when I first arrived in this fair city, but have since fully moved on.  Still, like every resident of Chicago, I regularly receive out-of-town visitors who insist on sampling this local cuisine.Pequod's is, by far, my favorite deep dish pizza, and if given the opportunity to steer this rube of a visitor who insists on wasting one of their precious Chicago meals on this food, I will make every concerted effort to take them here.",5,1,positive
3163,"I finally made my way to Peaquod's Pizzeria after hearing a lot of buzz about how they offer one of the best tasting pizzas in Chicago.  There are two levels to this restaurant: first floor has a bar vibe to it with its stools and high tables while the second floor offers a pizzeria feel with its booths.  My party opted to sit upstairs because it was less crowded and noisy.We started off with some cheesy garlic bread and breaded mushrooms, which were nothing special.  It tastes just like any other pizzeria I have been to.  For pizza, we decided on thin crust, yea I know I know...it all about the deep dish but we're just not deep dish kind of people.  We got half pineapple and bacon and half pepperoni and sausage.  Oh my goodness, this pizza was delicious.  There was something about the seasoning and the crust that pushed this pizza to the next level.  The cheese was cooked just right that it was still bubbling and gooey when it came out.The service here was also pretty good.  Our waitress was really attentive and had a great sense of humor.  She served us each a slice of pizza when it came out and made sure all our drinks were still full throughout our meal.  Greatly appreciated!  The only thing I have to complain about is their cleanliness.  The table was sticky and the seats were full of crumbs from previous customers.  How hard is it to take a rag and wipe it down?  Eh....even though it's not that clean, it's not a deal breaker.  I'll still come back for their delicious pizza.",14,5,positive
3164,Pequod's has very good deep dish pizza and the crust is what distinguishes it from other pizzerias in the city (though keep in mind that the crust is harder and maybe a little more blackened than other crusts).  The wait can be especially long but you can always order the pizza to go and browse the shelves at Barnes and Noble or another location while you wait.  The atmosphere is nice as well - it is a smaller restaurant than a Gino's East or Lou Malnati's but it also makes the experience a different one than going to a regular chain.,3,0,positive
3165,"My fav pizza place in Chicago! It's pan style pizza (or choice of thin crust) so the crust is thicker, but DELICIOUS. It's a popular place so go during off hours. I went right after work on a Wednesday and got there at 5:45...not too bad, but avoid it during dinner rush on the weekends. I wouldn't suggest getting any of the salads, it's nothing special. Although, I did enjoy the whale shaped mozzerella :)I also got delivery on lonely Friday night and I don't suggest it. If you're going to eat Pequods, dine in. The pizza came 1 hour and 30 min later due to it being a Friday night around dinner time (understandable). But by the time I dived in to eat it, it was soggy and not as hot.",7,2,positive
3166,"For the record, I consider myself a HUGE pizza connoisseur . I traveled to Chicago for a food tour using my handy and very helpful Yelp App. One of first stops was Pequod's Pizzeria. I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich and a deep dish pizza. The sandwich came out first and to my surprise, dominated the remaining food tour. This was a unique Italian Beef Sandwich with melted cheese and a caramelized crust on the bread. The pizza was great too, but this sandwich stole the show. I have talked about traveling back to Chicago just for that sandwich. (From Nevada).",4,1,positive
3167,"Decided to finally give them a try after many friends told us how great they were. We ended up ordering for carry out instead of eating in which in why for right now we are only giving them 4 stars. We ordered cheesy garlic bread which was nothing special but still very tasty. We also ordered the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers and it was very good. Also decided to get a small thin crust pizza, I know many people rave about the deep dish but my husband and I feel it is to heavy so we try to limit the amount of deep dish pizza we ingest. The thin crust reminded us more of a pan style pizza rather than normal cracker thin crust pizza. That being said it was still very delicious and they didn't skimp on the toppings! Definitely would order from them again and will have to eat there in order to find out how their service compares.",5,1,positive
3168,"This is the best deep dish pizza ever. I have gone here a million times and it is always the same quality and same taste! Never been to a place that is so consistent in their food quality and flavor!What I really love? Besides the caramelized crust and the quality of toppings, I love the quantity of sauce on their pizza! It is always perfect! Just the right amount, which doesn't make their pizza go dry, even if you take it home and eat it the next day!No other place is of any comparison to Pequod's. It is worth all the hype!!I would recommend going on a week night to avoid the long wait on weekends!",8,1,positive
3169,"When I saw the yelp reviews on this place I decided I had to try it. It's possible that I caught them on an off night, but I won't be back. I ordered a large pan pizza for delivery with sausage on the whole thing, one half onion and green pepper, and the other half bacon. We were not quoted a delivery time and the pizza ended up taking around 1 hour and 20 minutes to be delivered. It wouldn't surprise me if this is standard for a Friday night, but it would have been nice to be told that on the phone. Additionally, the pizza arrived with canadian bacon instead of real bacon. I now know that they don't have bacon as a topping, but we ordered from our car without a menu and clearly asked for ""bacon"", not ham or canadian bacon. The person taking our order should have been able to catch this before it became a problem. As for the pizza, I was completely underwhelmed. They went REALLY light on the toppings. There were many bites that contained no toppings at all.This is very disappointing considering we paid 2.75 for full toppings and 1.75 for half toppings. I also wasn't a fan of the crust. It was like eating pizza off a soggy piece of bread. I'm not sure if the crust is meant to be like this or if the juices from the toppings soaked into the crust while the pizza was in transit to our house. Either way, it wasn't good. Overall, this was a terrible experience for $36.",5,2,negative

3171,"Creme Fraiche! Like Randy Marsh I was in food bliss. I had read all about the hype of Pequod's as the city's best deep dish (or is that pan?) pizza. I'd need reinforcements for this excursion. My buddy that just relocated to the area met up with Kris and I for our afternoon feast. No waiting to be seated and we had a nice booth in the corner. Based on a little Yelping research I knew deep dish was the thing to get here. Great taps of seasonal brews from Half Acre, Sam Adams and New Belgium. We put together an order while we got started on pitcher one of NB's 2 Below. Spinach, mushroom, garlic, extra sauce and light cheese for the lady. Sausage, pepperoni, garlic and extra sauce for the gents. It would look kind of odd if Kris and I both got our own pies, so I'm glad my buddy solved that problem for us. About the time we moved onto our second pitcher, the dude showed up struggling to hold our pizzas. Right here dude! These things clunked down on the table like they were Grandma's old cast iron skillet. They smelled fantastic for starters, that would be the garlic. We wasted no time tackling these pies. It's a little thick for my taste (that's what she said) which is why you'll want to go with extra sauce. The sauce is tangy and a bit spicy, but not sweet at all. I liked the charred cheese around the rim of the crust. That's a nice touch that added another level of flavor. The garlic and pepperoni kicked in with some spiciness and the big chunks of fenneled sausage were tasty. Pretty damn good. I liked this one better than the veggie, but they were both great. Our beer and za gluttony hit Thanksgiving levels as we caught up and the brew flowed on to the third pitcher. Things were not expensive at all. I think our pies were $25 even with all the toppings and the pitchers were about $17. That's a steal that we'll surely take advantage of again. I also liked that they had all the accompaniments of red pepper, grated cheese and herbs on the table already. I had an excellent afternoon buzz by the time we left and had such a great time that I halted the cab dead in it's tracks when I realized I had forgotten our leftovers at Pequod's. I think I was about halfway down the block in pouring rain when I heard Kris ask if I was really going back to get them. Is this man serious about pizza? I think so. 4.5 stars",17,8,positive

Finally when it comes I'm expecting some really great pizza for the wait, um NO! Think again it wasn't the best or worst but it's definitely not worth waiting a hour. I'd rather go to Lou malnati. To top it off the place was dirty we sat at a booth with wet napkins under our booth on the floor. No need for any more just a sad experience.",4,5,negative

The deep dish is similar to Lou's but really does have that homemade taste that the larger chains lack. I tend to go for the Italian sausage and mushroom, but the pepperoni is also excellent. The sauce is somewhat plain, but allows for the toppings to really come through. I would ignore any thoughts about appetizers, none of them have really stood out to me and the pizza really does deserve your empty stomach.Make a reservation if you have a larger party or you will end up waiting for quite awhile.

3191,I went for the first time i have been eating pizza for about 40 years and i half to truly say this is the WORSE pizza i have ever eaten. Hardly any cheese we got a veg. and 1 with beef where is the VEG. and the BEEF and the CHEESE what a waist of money and time crust was BURNT to where you could not eat it some people in my party didn't even eat that was sad. NEVER AGAIN IF I COULD GIVE PEQUODS A BIG FAT 0 STARS I WOULD.,0,1,negative
3192,"Wow wow wow. Pequod's is now my favorite thin crust pizza - not just in Chicago, but anywhere! We stopped in here for an early lunch on a Saturday, and it was basically empty. It was then (along with seeing the TVs and bar) that I realized this is probably more of an evening/pizza/beers scene, but I would go back for any meal. We were a little taken aback from the prices ($15.90 for a large, plus ~$2 for each topping) but once we saw actually how large the ""large"" was, it made sense. The two of us were able to eat both lunch and dinner off that one pizza. We ordered ours with pepperoni, sausage, and giardiniera which was a great combo to start with. But it was their seasonings, the crust, and the thinness of the pizza in general that put it over the top. So many flavors, so delicious.The service was attentive and I think it was either the manager or owner who came by to see how everything was. For two of us and two pops, it was about $30 including tip. I can't wait until we go the next time so I can try the deep dish, or the $4.95 lunch special!",6,0,positive
3193,"Ive had my fair share of Chicago deep dishes, but this is a place I've been looking forward to trying for a long time.  And it delivered on all the hype!  The crust isn't too heavy like other deep dish places and the high temp crush lends to some amazing flavor.  If you are keen to try amazing deep dish, put this place in your top 3.",6,2,positive
3194,"Their lunch special is pretty decent - $4.95 for a personal deep-dish pizza with one topping and a beer or a soda. I got the lunch special with sausage and mushroom toppings. Out of all the deep-dish pizza joints I've tried in Chicago, this one was the best. However, it still wasn't that great. The waitress on the other hand was not friendly at all. She came to us yawning and looking really bored. While we were ordering and once we were done ordering, she just gave us a really blank stare - no expression on her face whatsoever.Overall, the pizza was average and the service sucked.",5,2,negative
3195,"Wonderful carmalized crust!This place is my favorite pizza place! They're wonderful! Excellent service, excellent food. The pizzas are fantastic. They don't skimp on the toppings, and the crust is always a crispy golden brown (perfection!). We always get a large, so that there's plenty of leftovers. The best thing about this place is that they're open until 2am!",7,0,positive
3196,"How is this place so popular??  Its just an ordinary sports bar.  The thin crust pizza is very meh, totally bland.  Didn't like it.  No atmosphere.  I guess the deep dish must be amazing, I'll admit I didn't try it.  The poppers were really good, the salads taste like Olive Garden. (in a boring way)",5,2,negative
3197,"Would have given them 0 Stars but it wasn't an option so one star was the very least available. I was told by the host that there was a wait  when there was visible seating available. Told I could go upstairs and find a seat but the staff upstairs said I had to speak to the host,which I had already done.. Confusion and no communication amongst the staff. Rude people working with customers, ridiculous. The pizza isn't at all worth the hassle!! Better off getting a Groupon cause Pequods sucks!!",3,3,negative
3198,"Love this place ! Great for groups and I actually suggest you should come with one anyways since the pizzas take a while to cook you'll need company to pass the time with. They're close to the Webster st movie theater and a barnes and noble as well as within a mile or two of some great shops so I feel I always stop in whenever I'm in the middle of an errand. I always order extra cheese with sausage and it's delicious! It's huge so I end up with leftovers but I'm totally fine with that. Most of the time the servers are very attentive and I rarely ever have an empty glass of water but I know on their busiest nights they seldom forget. I'd like to sit at the bar next time around and have a diff experience . Great taste, chill place and they have an upstairs too I believe !",7,1,positive
3199,"Not a fan.  The crust is weird and it's not quite Chicago, not quite thin crust, just not quite anything to me.  My husband enjoyed it, but he's a simple man.  Appreciate their love for the Blackhawks but this pizza is for a specific customer... not for the masses.",2,1,negative

We must've waited over an hour for this damn pizza. Then we waited a little bit more for our order, which we had placed when we gave the hostess our name, because we knew it'd be a wait.Was it worth it? I'm at a stage in life where I'd probably never voluntarily subject myself to this again. Unless it was suddenly divulged that David Bowie, circa ""The Hunger"" era would be serving it to me, and that we would make out afterwards. The staff at Pequod's are energetic and nice. There are benches outside, if it gets too claustrophobic inside. The caramelized crust reminds me of getting the corner piece of homemade lasagna.I liked it. But next time, I'll make sure to go on an off night/time of day.",4,3,positive
3202,"This was my first deep dish pizza and I was just expecting so much more cheese and sauce... I got the personal cheese so that might have been the issue; it was mostly crust with a layer of sauce. But my companions got a whole pie and theirs was also mostly crust. The crispy edge was good!! But for 2000 reviews, I just wanted a gooey mass of cheese (on a cheese pizza). Unfortunately that's not what I got. Too bad :/",1,1,negative

The crust is crunchy and yummy, and they did a nice job with the amount of peperoni - the saucy side was super saucy - my people enjoyed it a lot !!",5,1,negative

Get there they said 1 hr wait and we would be next party of 5 to be seated, check in because buzzers don't always work. We took our buzzer, came back in an hour checked in, was told a few tables ahead of us ( I questioned this and the guy was a jerk), so we waited, mean while 2 other party of 5 were seated (lil confused how we were next yet 2 other tables went ahead).  Finally after 1 1/2 hrs of waiting a girl came grabbed my arm said party of 5, I said yes she said follow me, we followed her to a table sat down got comfortable decided what to order next thing we know the guy (the jerk) comes back up to us says it wasn't our table and forced us to come down and wait again. No appology, nothing. Was so unorganized, unprofessional and RUDE treatment ever. I will NEVER eat there again. The sign on the was even stated call in advance you get half the wait time, Wait time was 2 hours we called and still waited OVER 1hr and 40 min. We left, never again!

3209,"Went to Pequod's last week and just got around to leaving a review. There was no wait around 8 and we got in right away which was nice. This was my first time going to Pequod's and thought that the restaurant was very nice. It had a nice sporty but classy atmosphere. The bar looked to be nice and they seemed to have many options but I can strictly for one thing, the pizza! The hostess sat my friend and In the back near the restrooms and kitchen. It was quite loud and hard to hear the other person talk and I felt like I was right in the path of the servers. Possibly get rid of that table. We ordered a small pepperoni pan pizza which was a a good price. The small is cut into four pieces and is plenty to feed two or three people. The pizza came out pretty quick no long wait for the kind of pizza that it is which was nice and the pizza looked wonderful. I took my first bite and I was very pleased. However I was not overwhelmed with the first bite. The sauce was okay but nothing to special and the pepperoni was good but they were typical pepperoni pieces that I could find on a dominos pizza.  Overall the service was great and the pizza was okay but nothing out of the ordinary. I would recommend this place to friends though.",17,2,negative

We killed the small pizza and were stuffed in a good fatty kind of way.",4,2,positive
3211,"Make a reservation.  It was nice watching St. Louis send San Francisco to the World Series (in style), but a playoff game has a finite start and end.  Waiting to sit while standing in a very crowded doorway where it's warm, or sitting and catching a bit of breathing room in the freezing cold does not.  ""Forty-five minutes"" is like telling someone it's just up the road five miles when they're driving in the country.  The wait went on for an e.t.e.r.n.i.t.y.  They let us pre-order our pizza so that when we sat, we wouldn't have to wait for eternity, part 2.  Once we sat (we had our own chairs! and table!  in the warm!  and got to catch the end of the game!), we only had to wait another ten minutes or so.Will the wait make our pizza taste like hype?  Will our pizza have been burnt to a crisp, then turn cold waiting for us?  When did Mike Matheny retire AND become a coach?!  These were the questions shooting through our minds and empty bellies.  (I think I just had a flashback to Soap - pardon me.)The pizza was amazing and okay.  You really need to start at the edge, then work your way in.  The outside crust is a perfect soft/crisp pizza cracker, flavored with years of other pizzas.  The crust is caramelized with prior pizza's flavorings and cheese, then burnt just enough.  Like the good pieces of a macaroni and cheese casserole, only with a great fatty cheese flavor.  The ingredients on the pizza are fresh - a definite score in my book.  (Home run sounded too cheesy - do I get quadruple points for a double pun, make that a triple pun?)  The center is a tad undercooked.  It's almost doughy.  Not all together bad, just not as brilliant as the outer crust.  The sauce is a bit bland, too.  Not stewed tomatoes bland, jut not zesty.I'd definitely return if I had a reservation, but I think I'd try Malnati's first.",15,10,positive
3212,"About as good as deep dish gets in my book. The cheesy crust may look burnt but it's the best part of the pie - don't throw it away! On the downside, something clearly needs to be done about the wait times given that reservations aren't really taken.",3,2,positive
3213,"....better than Lou's?  I must have just shortened my life expectancy by uttering those blasphemous words.  I dont care.  My new benchmark for Chicago pizza is Pequods.  A few simple reasons why I have redefined my pizza pecking order....1.  Balance: Crust...cheese...and that SAUCE create a perfect triumvirate of flavor that is in complete harmony.  It isnt a wheel of cheese with some diced tomotoes....2.  The carmelized crust....I dont eat my crust ANYWHERE else ....but here.3.  The SAUCE is flavorful...and finds its way into every bite because there is plenty of it4.  It isnt a chain...so their quality control is stellar and meals are handcrafted instead of that  ""assembly line"" vibeThe atmosphere is fun and they have enough TVs to make it a fine game day option.  Hey... This is pizza...not foie gras.  It should be simple...and in Chicago...it should be GREAT.  Food is like art...and noone can tell you what tastes good to your mouth...but I cant imagine anyone defining Chicago pizza any better.",9,1,positive
3214,"Very disappointing.  Service was lousy.  Downstairs was half empty, but they marched us upstairs to be seated.  Then they realized that upstairs was full, so we went back down. Seated us at the bar, but then another worker said my son couldn't sit at the bar.  After we finally got to a table, it took them over an hour to bring us a small, thin crust cheese pizza.  Other tables that were seated twenty minutes after us got pizzas faster.  No apologies, no explanation other than that the waiter should have told us it could take 45 minutes for a pizza.  When we finally got it, the pizza was fine but nothing special.  For thin crust, the crust was too chewy.  We live in the neighborhood and have eaten here before, but doubt we will bother again.",2,3,negative
3215,"Here's the clincher with Pequods pizza: they have this awesome way of burning the crust on the edges so that the crust caramelizes, you eat it, and then your taste buds simultaneously implode and explode.This is the pizza place you take out-of-towners to when they ask you to present the best pizza in Chicago. I once ordered Pequods for my buddy's bachelor party and throughout the night received no less than 5 compliments on the excellent pizza recommendation. No less!Also literally every time I have ordered delivery the pizza is EXACTLY the same. I don't know what kind of ritual they perform to make sure the pizza is always consistently awesome, but it's powerful, old, and dark magic.",8,3,positive

3218,"I am from Chicago, born and raised. What I am about to say is, quite possibly, sacrilegious...I HATE ""CHICAGO STYLE"" DEEP/ PAN PIZZA. I really don't like it.That being said, Pequod's is pretty good. It's not nearly as greasy or ""corn sweet"" like Pizzeria Uno/ Lou Malnatis and the sauce here is for sure better. Good sausage recipe. It still didn't entirely ""blow me away"" though and I wouldn't rush to come back. I really just dislike Pan/ Deep pizza, they do have a thin crust option and may have to give that a shot. The girl I was with seemed to enjoy it but I think she is also in the ""meh to deep dish"" camp as well.Not a bad beer selection, had Daisy Cutter on draft. Didn't see wine selections and should have probably done that. Too many carbs on carbs.People who work here are very nice, service was overall quick and affable. Just going to have to try the thin-crust next time. My leftover warmed up nicely in the oven though. If you ARE a Deep/ Pan Pizza lover, yes, you SHOULD try the pizza here.",12,4,negative

3220,Pizza is good. However the headache trying to get it for takeout is not worth it. Not only is it over and hour wait..you have to wait at least ten minutes inside to pay and get it all while getting pushed all cramped up. Yes they are busy but the reason is they are very unorganized. The system does not work well. People leave angry and I wasnt the only one. The girl working was not only slow as hell but also complaining the whole time and almost had a breakdown yelling at coworkers from being overwhelmed.  This is a big reason we rarely come here even though we eat pizza often. It not worth the hassle.  There's other good pizza. Bye.,6,8,negative
3221,"IMO the best deep-dish in Chicago.They already have over a thousand reviews, but I'll just add my $0.02 for good measure.  I don't even particularly like deep dish, but damn, I can always make an exception for Pequod's. The best for me is a pan pizza w/ pepperoni and onions. Yes, it is as good as everyone is saying.The few times i've gotten vegetable toppings I was underwhelmed. They were still crispy and tasted raw, like they were thrown on at the last minute. Maybe that's how it's supposed to taste, but I prefer cooked toppings even if they shrivel a bit. Another gripe I have is the time it takes for them to get the pizzas out. I seem to remember waiting upwards of 50 minutes a few times, which seems a bit long. Whatever - just have a few beers in the meantime!",7,3,positive

I love Pizza and have had Lou Malnati's before so I felt obligated to try this. 1) Whale with a Thong - So when I saw the picture I said ""is that a whale with a thong on its face?"". Yes, yes it is. I have no clue while Fudgy the Whale's debauch brother rides a motorcycle with a woman's thong (or cows thong?) on its face, but more power to him.2) Pizza - Wow. I honestly prefer Chicago pizza and this was awesome. I ordered cheese and sausage and had to force myself to stop eating. Thick, airy, buttery crust. Sauce and cheese in the right amounts. Thick slices of sausage. The whole thing was perfect. A medium can feed 3 humans so order appropriately. The restaurant also has a great bar vibe. I could see just drinking beer and watching the Blackhawks or Cubs here. Loved everything about it. I also ordered fried zucchini which was fine. I will 100% go back.",7,2,positive

The sauce is impeccable (not too sweet or too watery) and the crust is a caramelized delight. It's deep dish that isn't overly bready. Don't even bother with thin crust, just go for the special.

People on that list waited 15 minutes and got seated, while our party of 4 had to wait over 3 times that long!  Also, they had several tables waiting to be cleared for 15-20 minutes plus while they just sat around, not doing anything!  Seriously the worst experience ever.

I really liked that you could pick it up and eat it in hand rather than with a fork like most deep dish, and the pepperoni was perfectly crisp on top. There wasn't as much cheese as I'm used to and I think it is overall less than most deep dish pizzas. It wasn't too saucer which I appreciated. The bottom crust was really thick and I'm not sure how much I loved that, but they bake cheese on the outside rim of the crust which I really liked it. We also got fried mushrooms that were really good! One of my fav appetizers. We only ordered take out so I haven't been in, but I will be back again for sure!",13,1,positive

I used to work across the street at the movie theater and myself, and the crew used to come on over after work; and have drinks and eat. Pan Pizza is still the same unique flavor with the famous burnt caramelized crust. I'm giving it four stars due to there lack of taking proper reservations/system for a table without waiting. I tried coming here the other day and called ahead and forget about it. Place had boat loads of people waiting outside. Even though you call ahead you still have to wait two and a half hours to be seated; and then an hour and a half to get your food!

When we arrived at the time we had indicated on said request, we were told it would be about 15-20min, which is totally understandable. The frustrating part came when groups of walk-ins who came in after started to be seated before us. Even more frustrating was that the 15-20min was more like 45-50. But like I said, the pizza went a long way to making me feel better. This was one of those rare times when the food lived up to the hype. Although a bit pricey, the pizza had a really good balance of sauce and cheese...with the chunks of sausage being huge and flavorful. While I would go back, the price and long wait time prevent me from doing it more often.",7,5,positive

Love the customer service!  Ordered a pan carry out once, took it all the way home before we realized it was thin crust.  We were disappointed -- this is our go to place for deep dish -- but the manager called me personally in less than 24 hours and comped us our original order after I wrote.This is the kind of food and customer service that engenders loyalty!",3,1,positive

3248,"Made my second visit to Pequod's last Friday; I will have to go back more often for sure.  I was big on the carmelized crust the first time around but the pepperoni toppings and the sauce were a minor letdown.  This time, on the advice of my new friend Jeremiah, we got a medium deep dish with sausage...damn, this was good.  The meat was incredible and the crust was slightly less burned this time out so I could take down every inch of real estate.  Service was fast and the crowd was lively....in fact, when we left around 7, there was a huge line outside.  Didn't know Pequod's was this popular!",5,2,positive
3249,"This is my favorite pizza in the entire city of Chicago. On the outside, it kind of looks like a hole in the wall bar. The prices are reasonable, and the pizza is so good. Go with the deep dish, my favorite is just deep dish with sausage and green pepper, and the portions are huge so I always have leftovers. Plus, they burn the crust, which sounds gross but it's amazing.I have a few complaints, but it's just SO good that I can't dock a star. Call ahead to get a table. Especially on the weekends, this place is packed.Also, it takes forever to get your pizza. Don't come starving, because you will wait for at least an hour. Overall, I recommend this place to everyone that moves to Chicago and comes to visit Chicago. Every single person has loved it and goes back all the time.",8,3,positive
3250,"I am a bit weird, I like burnt things. I like those few burnt potato chips you find in the bag or a nicely charred hot dog from the grill. That is why Pequod's is my kind of place. Not that the pizza is burnt, but the way they construct their deep dish is unlike any other in Chicago. The cheese actually forms a caramelized crust on the pizza which gives this delicious, almost burnt flavor. It is the most terrific thing you will eat. Being from Chicago, people ask me about Gino's or Lou Malnanti's, they ain't got nothing on Pequod's. I recommend this place to all those that travel to Chicago looking for a deep dish.",7,1,positive
3251,"In short: Very busy, no reservations but they do call aheads. And the pizza takes 50minutes (supposedly). So plan ahead. Awesome deep dish pizza.This pizza was quite excellent. We got the pan pizza, with half sausage & half cheese. It is a saucy deep dish pizza, with an awesome carmellized crust. They seem to layer the pizza - dough, cheese, sauce, toppings - which totally works for me! It was awesome!! We also got the cheesy garlic bread and some drinks. Overall I think this is my second favorite pizza in Chicago (Lou's is still first). We will definitely be back. Be sure to plan ahead tho - it gets really busy at this location (like standing on top of tables while people eat) and it takes 50min for a pizza (I guess when it's busy?!). You can place your order while you wait though, which I would highly recommend.",8,1,positive

I was asked if I wanted to pay when I ordered, or pay the driver ---- so I noted I would pay driver.  They failed to mention that was cash-only.  I didn't even think 2x that this might be the case, given options these days with the Square and other technology, So, that took another 10 minutes to resolve. And on top of it all, the pizza wasn't hot!!  Ugh, really wanted to like it, but it was just ok.  I might try eating in sometime - I'm sure that's a different experience.",4,1,negative
3254,"Being a Californian, it's rare that I get a decent deep dish pizza around here. After Pequod's, I ALMOST got converted to this seriously intense pie, and I'm a thin crust pizza kind of girl.We noticed that they offered the thin crust variety but (of course) we opted for the small pan pizza, extra toppings: sausage, pepperoni, fresh garlic, and extra cheese. My was it lip-smacking, melt-in-your-mouth, porky, cheesy, garlicky goodness. And the crust, perfectly crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Definitely a game changer. This is not the slice of pie you eat with your hands, you've really got to get in there with a fork and knife. It's heavy and hearty and with only four slices we still had leftovers. Be patient, it's a thick, burly pizza so it will take about 30 minutes to cook. Completely worth the wait.I love the casual, sports bar atmosphere in here. Perfect place to come hang out, drink some brews, and share a pie.",8,3,positive

We definitely weren't disappointed this time! We sat down pretty quickly, but the wait was a bit long - an hour + for a pizza. I'm not one to complain though, so we were happy to hang out and wait.

(For a long time, I would take the top bun off my burgers...) Anyway, the dough here was perfectly crunchy on the outside, with the inside being soft. The pizzas are made to order and you basically customize your pizza. YUM! I was so full after 1 1/2 slices...which is WEAK for me. Oh, but I also had a side of their fries and chicken wings which were hot, fresh and yummy, too.I would definitely recommend this place for deep dish!",7,0,positive
3261,"Bland pizza with a ""specialty"" of burnt crust. When I made pizzas, we tossed any that got burned. Now it's nostalgic? I'm sure Pequod stacks up well against Gino's East and Giordanos, but that's not saying much. Probably stacks up favorably to a Tombstone Pizza, too, but that doesn't make it good enough to put in my mouth when there are so many, better pizza options out there. Sure, I eat three meals a day but I'd still like to enjoy the eating experience each time. Why waste one here? Pass on Pequod's and you can thank me later.",7,2,negative
3262,"I'm going to bump them up a star after giving the pizza a second chance.  My best gal and I were craving deep-dish and for some reason my memory of the aesthetic here called me like a siren.  It just seemed like the right kind of place from which to escape the summer Sunday heat.  Maybe because of the semi-darkness and blue light?Anyway, I still think that the pizza is strangely bland, but I tracked the problem to the sauce, so it makes more sense to me now.  It just needs more seasoning, I think.  Otherwise the pizza is pretty great, especially the crust, which manages to be crispy on the bottom and edges but bready in the middle.  The pizza reheats really well in a conventional oven, which is a rarity.We had an egregiously sullen (and often absentee) waitress.  However, they seemed to do a shift change while we were there, and all of the evening people seemed pleasant enough.  So maybe we just got a bad apple.Oh, and the upstairs men's room has a four-foot Gandalf head painted on the wall.  You don't see that every day...or actually, ever.",9,7,positive

The pizza here isn't better or worse, it's just different.As the menu says, it's a deep dish pan pizza. The carmalized crust, as others have noted, is really great and the crunchiness carries over through the whole pizza. I ordered a personal pan pizza with mushrooms and pineapples and it was really great. It was a lot more reasonable of a portion than 7"" pizzas from the other pizza joints would have been.That said, it just doesn't compare - literally. It's not at all like the other deep dish places.

Well, I was full after once slice of mile-thick pepperoni and mushroom 'za, had to keep up with the crowd and have a second slice, and then was still so impressed with the quality that I had to have a third.

3278,"Went to Pequod's with high expectations after hearing so much buzz about their caramelized crust. Well, if you've never had it, here's the straight talk: caramelized crust = burnt cheese crust. They put extra cheese on the edge so that it ""caramelizes"" but it's not really a dark golden char, like maybe a grilled cheese would produce. It's burnt. As in black. As in potentially-cancer-inducing burnt. If you're into that, then this is your place. As for me, um, no thanks.Jet's Pizza is caramelized. Pequod's is burnt. Simple as that.What's more, one of our two pizzas had a burnt crust on the bottom. The servers didn't seem to care a lick about it. When we talked to the manager, he shrugged his shoulders and said the pizza happened to be in a hotter spot in the stove. OK. But we still don't like burnt-bottom-crust pizza. After some more (polite) discussion, the manager gave us a replacement pizza...but of course we had to wait another 20 minutes for it.On the plus side, there was a generous amount of sauce and the sausage had a nice flavor to it. But if burnt edge crust (and apparently burnt bottom crust too) is their signature, I'll pass and go back to Lou's or the original Uno's on Ohio Street.",6,1,negative

Did some googling and yelping and Pequod's got some fine reviews; we figured it was worth the trek out from the downtown loop. Indeed it was! Taking our server's advice, my husband and I split a small pan pizza. We were expecting it to be a grease-bomb (in a good way of course) so were pleasantly surprised to find it not so. Could have been our toppings chosen: sausage, onion, fresh tomato & garlic (best combo btw). We were def full, in fact I couldn't finish my second piece; luckily my husband was more than happy to. One thing we noticed... Most people don't seem to finish, which isn't terribly surprising, but they make a big mistake by not even touching the crust -- it's almost the best part!! It's got some kind of caramelised cheese thing going on there -- amazing!! If you cant finish a whole piece of pizza (no shame in that) make sure you eat from side to side, rather than tip to crust, otherwise you will miss out!!!I'm thinking our meal came to $25 bucks, including 2 bottles of rootbeer.

The restaurant is kind of divey and cramped (though they have an upstairs seating area that is a little more roomy) but the pizza more than makes up for the lack of ambiance in the restaurant. The special thing about the pizza here is the ""caramelized cheese crust"" which basically just means they let the cheese ooze over the side of the crust so that it forms a burnt cheesy ring when cooked in the hot dish. Burnt cheese, people, it's a thing. This crust is PHENOMENAL. Do yourself a favor and add Pequod's to your list of must-try deep-dish spots!",4,2,positive

3289,"Y'all ... this is the place for deep dish. You MUST get here. Crispy, flavorful, filling, and local. No chain ingredients, no revolving door managers moving from one restaurant to another. Legit.We have become such big fans that we had our Wedding Weekend Friday night welcome dinner here, to give our family and friends the best taste of Chicago pizza there is.  So let me explain it to you ... real ... slow. A) Load it up. We get sausage, pepperoni, giardiniera, AND jalepenos. So a medium costs nearly $30. With six slices, you can consider two slices a FILLING $10 dinner, one slice a good solid $5 lunch, and the pizza is now a bargain. And they give MAD amounts of toppings.B) It will take longer than they say or longer than you think. Wait. It's worth it. If they say 40 minutes, expect 50. No biggie. Watch the Blackhawks, let your mouth water and your belly rumble.C) No, they didn't burn it. They put cheese on the outside of the crust to give it a salty, caramelized, crunchy texture that no one else can match. Embrace it. You'll never want a deep dish without it.D) Heat up your leftovers right! Here's how you do it:1) Get the pizza out of the fridge for @20 minutes before putting it in the oven to take the chill off.2) Get your oven up to 450 degrees, with your cast iron pan inside. Just before taking out the pan to put the pizza in, feel free to spread a small amount of oil or bacon fat on it.3) Place one or two pieces in the pan so that the edges are against the pan's edges, to re-crisp the outside.4) Plop it back in the oven, turn down the temp to 325, and heat it up for 5-8 minutes.5) Repeat with more slices as you wish.You now have the knowledge. Make it happen.",9,4,positive

Hyped up and ready to go, the line outside of the restaurant seemed like a good sign. ""Okay, cool, tons of people here, good atmosphere, this is a local favorite."" My group was told that it was a 40-45 minute wait.Once that time had passed, my friends and I noted that people who arrived after us were getting seated before us. Okay, fine, maybe they had reservations. We went in to check when our seated time was, and were told that we could actually order our pizza ahead of time, so that it would be ready much sooner after we were seated. We ordered a medium pan pizza (the caramelized crust was so hyped up!) with bell peppers and onions and went back outside to wait our turn. Over an hour had passed, so we went in; only after double-checking and seeing names after ours crossed out, we were immediately allowed in and seated.We were seated in one of their rooms upstairs, where there was an abundance of empty booths and tables - confusing as to why our wait time was so long. After notifying the server that we had already put our pizza order ahead, and ordering the appetizer combo (a great choice; really nice, hot breaded appetizers served with ranch and marinara - I'd say my favorites were the mushroom and zucchini), we began chatting, eagerly awaiting the main course. She came back out shortly afterwards and notified that she couldn't locate our order, and asked again what the name on it was. She double-checked in the kitchen, pulled out a receipt with our name to show us, and it turned out that while the pizza order was correct, several additional items had been added to the order. After further investigation, our pizza was discovered to have been sent to the wrong table. Long story short, we eventually got all of our food. As said before,the appetizers were timely and delicious. The pizza took an incredibly long time to be served, the ""caramelized"" crust was more of a burnt cheese fixture and the pizza itself was too saucy and cheesy. Nothing to write home about, but okay enough pizza. We received our check quickly and left.tl;dr the food was decent, though not worth the hype, and the service could definitely be more organized. A reasonably disappointing experience overall.",21,5,negative
3296,"A local recommended this place.  I was a little disappointed.  I did not like the salad.  The pizza was not traditional Chicago deep dish, in my opinion, but more common pan pizza ala the chain restaurants like Pizza Hut, with a very thick crust.  I did like the carmelized crust, but the crust did not support the pizza well.  It got very soggy. I also think the sauce was lacking something...probably salt, and I am not a big salty food eater, but it was very bland.  Given how far this place was from downtown, I wouldn't go there again when visiting Chicago.",6,2,negative
3297,"I understand that they are busy due to the ""DePaul"" location. The front staff was efficient on a Sunday, but at some point you have to close the windows and TURN ON the AC ! This summer was super humid ! The pizza was average to me, but others' taste will vary. Overall I prefer the joint a few blocks up Ashland.",3,1,negative
3298,"Absolutely delicious!  My 2nd favorite pizza spot. The crust is just the best and the slices are huge.  The service has always been pleasant. Depending on when you go your wait may be long but I guarantee its well worth it.  I've had appetizers,  salads,  and pizza from there. All have been very tasty.",7,0,positive
3299,"these deep dish pizzas are ridiculous. It's fully loaded goodness of cheese and good quality toppings. And a pitcher of beer is cheap here. Although it takes about 45 minutes for the pizza to cook, it really is worth it. That oily crust is outstanding. If anything, before going back to LA, I would order boxes to take home. It really is that good.",5,2,positive
3300,"I'm not from Chicago and don't know much about Chicago style pizza, but what I do know is that I really enjoyed my pie at Pequod's.  Sauce, crust, the flavorful sausage - all excellent and tasty. Other than that, I don't suppose the 1300th review of a much-loved institution is of much use, but I'll only add that I suspect Pequod's gets a lot of extreme reactions.  Its tradmark is a ring of caramelized cheese around the crust, and a very well-done exterior.  Some people like that (me) and others don't.  But whichever one of those you are, be prepared for the fact that this doesn't taste as much like other Chicago style pizzas as you might expect. In the end, I'm still partial to New York pizza, but Pequod's is an excellent example of what it is.",5,1,positive

3302,"Stopped here on our way through Chicago. We were looking for good Chicago pizza without having to go downtown.

3303,"I love me some deep dish from Quods.Their deep dish is great, among the best in Chicago. The carmelized cheese on the crust makes it what it is. Its much better when you eat-in (retains the crispiness), but delivery is still good. The thin crust is so-so. Its fine in a pinch but there are better places in Chicago. Eat-in if you can. There are always long lines but its a fun place to watch a Blackhawks game.",8,0,positive

3306,"Pequod's is a must-try for all Chicago-style lovers. Easily one of the top three best pizzas I've had in Chicago. Or anywhere, for that matter... since as everyone knows, Chicago has the best pizza in the world!So here's the dish on the deep dish:- The sauce wasn't the best I've had (I'm a sauce snob) but it was tasty, fresh, and definitely above-par.-  The amount of cheese was a bit on the lighter side compared to a Gino's pizza, but then again, I've nearly choked on the cheese there, so I'm okay with curbing the mozzarella overkill.- The toppings were huge and plentiful. (I recommend the Hawaiian if you like pieces of Canadian bacon the size of your face)But the crust! Oh, the CRUST! It was unlike any deep dish crust I've ever had, so light and fluffy and savory! It fills you up too: we had a group of 7 big eaters and we barely made a dint in our second pizza.The service and ambiance were forgettable, but that crust is not, so I will be returning very soon!",9,1,positive
3307,"This was my introduction to deep dish in Chicago. It's not the deepest I'm told, but still intimidating for a girl raised on Wolfgang Puck. The atmosphere is fun and raucous, not good for an intimate date but perfect for a catchup with a friend. Our waitress was not incredibly attentive, but it may have been because we were clearly deep in conversation and she didn't want to disturb us, which I appreciate. When the pizza came I was pretty sure even my beer and a half wasn't going to stimulate my appetite enough to tackle my portion of it. Indeed, I only got partway through my second slice because my companion mocked my lack of Chicago spirit. The first bite was exquisite. The crust is lovely and the ingredients were well distributed; fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and an ever-so-slightly crispy bottom. Everyone talks about their caramelized crust, but it's worth mentioning again because it truly does distinguish them.The second time I popped in for their lunch special, I was disappointed, particularly considering my agreeable first experience. My main issue was the service. I waited about ten minutes for my waitress to return after giving me a menu, and the restaurant was not busy by any stretch of the imagination. Eventually I asked the girl behind the bar and she ended up serving me for the most part while my waitress walked past me over and over, completely ignoring me. Perhaps she was blind in one eye and I should be kinder, but my guess is she just didn't care much.The pizza was still good, but didn't wow me like the first time. Perhaps it was that the smaller pizzas don't come in the skillet and therefore aren't protected from the elements, or perhaps it was that the atmosphere contributed heavily to my enjoyment. Whatever the case, I was underwhelmed by the lunch special - $5 is a great deal for a personal pizza, but you have to dine in and the presentation leaves something to be desired. Go with a friend and tackle a real pie. And leave some room in the fridge.",23,4,positive

The deep was delish but the extra thin was the bomb..!  You get what you want for toppings, we all have our own tastes, that's a gimme.  But you look to the crust and its flavor when you've identified a delicious pizza.  It's REAL at Pequod's..!",1,0,positive

3313,"Made it back for another try of Pequads and it didn't disappoint.  Last time I went conservative with plain pie, but this time friend wanted to load it up with ham, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms and extra sauce. OMG a flavor explosion is best way to describe it. Sausage and pepperoni in particular were spectacular.  Pepperoni wasn't usual over salted super spicy but on mild smokey side- loved it and I'm not a pepperoni fan usually. Good thing I live nowhere close to this pizza place- I'd really gain unwanted pounds fast.",6,3,positive
3314,"I am a little hesitant to write this review simply because I've heard so many good things about Pequod's (perhaps more recommendations than any other pizza place in Chicago) and also, I think I may have had some bad luck. But my experience with Pequod's last weekend can only be summarized as mediocre. A friend and I went for a late lunch on a Sunday. I've heard crazy things about wait-times at this place, and we were seated instantly. (From what I've heard, waits typically only get bad around the dinner hour). Our service was just OK. The staff seemed a bit distant at first, but were increasingly friendly and more responsive as the meal went on, which was nice to see. We started with an order of cheesy garlic bread which honestly was unimpressive for all I've heard about this place. It was good, but it wasn't anything I couldn't heat up in the microwave with some bread, butter, garlic, and cheese. And just two fairly small pieces for around $5. The pizza itself is what really left me underwhelmed. There was nothing about this pizza's key elements that tasted any differently from any other tourist deep-dish place in Chicago. Quite frankly, the flavor and consistency of the crust is IDENTICAL to Gino's East. What's worse, the crust seemed even thicker, and there wasn't much cheese on my pizza. The thick/deep crust is something I don't mind if it's balanced out with the right amount of cheese and sauce, but this pizza didn't have that. We ordered pepperoni, and there was plenty of that. I had asked for half sausage, but for some reason I was brought a pizza with 1/4 sausage. When I asked the waitress about this, she did make sure I wasn't charged for 1/2 sausage, but then said that they don't do 1/4 or 1/2 toppings anyway (at least I think that's what she said). I was a little confused, but I was only charged for the one topping so that wasn't that big of a deal. Perhaps I had a bad pie. I want to try my luck again and see if it is better. The carmelized cheese I noticed - but I was waiting for it to make this big impact on my tastebuds and it just didn't happen for me. Bottom line, the pepperoni was average, the sauce was average, there wasn't enough cheese, and there was way too much crust in proportion to the rest of the ingredients. I was really disappointed; for all I had heard about Pequod's I expected more. As far as deep dish goes, I think there's a lot more to Chicago pizza than deep dish and it's not something I want more than a few times a year. But again, I didn't find Pequod's to be any better than some of the more-known tourist places like Gino's East, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, or Edwardo's. I've had better pizza from all of those places. I hope my experience is better next time. Pequod's isn't bad at all - but I wasn't able to find anything substantiating the hype I'd heard so much about.",18,12,negative
3315,"Heard so much great things about the pizza hear so tried it out tonight. The wait wasn't bad. Sat down in about 20 mins. Order a cesar salad which was a cesar salad but 1 grape tomato, (watching out for that food cost) . We were told that the pizza will take about 45 mins. That's was understandable but it really was more like 1 hr and 20 mins. After tables around us, that we sat after us and got their pizza way before we did. When we got our pizza after waiting an hour and 20, it's was burnt. I mean I notice the style of the crust was that way but the whole bottom part was caked of a thick layer of burned crust. Sorry but that just killed the flavor or the whole pizza. I wasnt asked if we're satisfied with everything at all, not until I flipped all the slices over, and I believe a manager came by and asked if we're ok and If the kitchen was preparing another one for us. I said no. I asked for the bill right after I got my pizza sauce, which also took awhile (Understandable it's pizza that had to get heated up). But I asked for the bill right away. The server didn't even wonder why or asked if everything was ok. Not until I told her and showed her the pizza, She was nice enough to take it off the bill. By far it was a horrible experience. I hear nothing but good things about this place but maybe I'll try it again but not anytime soon. Recommend not go when it's too busy cause it seems accidents happen and pizzas  comes out burned",10,4,negative
3316,"I've nearly lost some friends in Chicago for saying that I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish. It seems a little heavy and overdone to me.However, Pequod's brings me close to changing my mind. The crust is everything it's described as being - cheesy, flavourful, and delicious. It complements the pizza, which I at least enjoyed (although it's heavy enough that a slice was definitely enough for me).One slight issue was the length of the wait for the food, which we were warned about, but the hour-long wait was hard.The tiramisu was Americanized - overly sweet, not high quality - I wouldn't recommend it. However, I would recommend the rest of the food!",8,2,positive
3317,With +2k reviews I thought we hit the jackpot with the perfect deep dish pizza. Unfortunately we didn't. It was ok. It maybe our fault as we added too many ingredients.. But Regardless..

I've been trying to come here for quite some time but unfortunately I live 50 miles away.  Today I got my chance and they without a doubt are worth the hype. Lunch in Chicago for under 10 bucks is hard to come by. A quality lunch for under 10 is almost impossible.  I got the lunch special  (4.95) plus extra toppings (they weren't needed). I can't say enough about how good it was so I'll stop. If you like this type of pizza (obviously I do) then this place is for you.  If you want fancy, snobby, weird food then stay away. Old school great food at a fair price. Well done!",9,7,positive
3320,So I was just looking through my old reviews and saw my Pequod's review. Well I have been back many a time since then and it's great!  I think we just got a bad takeout one.  It got cold or whatever.  The place is great if you eat in.  The pizza is ohh so good and crispy.  The staff is nice and parking isn't that hard.  Let me get back to the pizza it' a gem.  Awesome wonderful amazing stuff. Just go eat it.,7,3,positive
3321,"Truly one of Chicago's best kept secrets. I am always surprised when friends haven't experiences the magical deliciousness of Pequod's caramelized crust. There is a great lunch special ($4.95 for a 7"" personal pan pizza and a beer/soda) and the toppings here do not mess around. Your pizza will come heaped with whatever you order on it. The appetizers are just so-so but the main event is really the pizza  The only real downside is that public transportation to Pequod's is not the easiest. Luckily I have always been able to find parking or can take the Ashland bus. This pizza, however, is definitely worth whatever distance you have to travel.",5,1,positive
3322,Pizza was good but nothing to go out the way for.  If you never had chicago pizza you will love it but I eat it all time around city and suburbs.  I'm south sider who took the trip north to try it and it was average and not worth trip l.  Dining room is smAll and tables are not comfortable.,4,0,negative
3323,"Needed to get that Chicago deep dish fix. After looking up several spots on yelp, decided to venture outside the downtown area. Showed up around 7ish and there was a line outside the building. Always a good sign. Checked in with the hostess and if was approx an hr wait. As we waited, take out orders were a plenty. Another good sign. 2 spots became available at the bar so we took them and our wait was cut shorter. Had the full order of Cesar salad and a small mushroom and pepperoni deep dish pizza plus a couple of local brews. Hit the spot. Great place and good service. Would come back again.",4,0,positive

3325,"BEST Chicago deep dish pizza.  Very well known place to any one who lives in Chicago and loves pizza. We have been coming here for years and it was always consistently tasty.   This place is always busy especially when it is their lunch or dinner rush.  We always order ahead on our way there so it doesn't take forever for the food to come out after we order.  Deep dish usually takes about 40 minutes to cook. Calling ahead also guarantees us a seat faster since our food is being made.  Never waited over 5 minutes even if it is a hour and a half wait.  We always order mozzarella sticks to start.  Their marinara dipping sauce has to be one of the best I have ever tried.  Sweet and savory.  We also get a medium deep dish pizza with: extra cheese, sausage, onions, green peppers and half mushroom.  OMG - BEST ever.  Cheese just oozing away.  Mounts of toppings and sweet marinara sauce. Their crust is perfectly cooked and the burnt cheese edges are perfect.   The staff is very friendly, fast and productive.  They are very well managed by the moment you walk in the door.  I will also come here for deep dish pizza no matter what!!!",12,0,positive
3326,"omg. why have i not reviewed this place yet?  this is our go-to for a freaking DELICIOUS stuffed pizza.  definitely the best in the city, which probably means the best in the world.  whoa, that is a bold statement.the crust is phenomenal.  it is crispy yet slightly doughy and soooo flavorful.  the cheese is delicious and the sauce is spot-on.  we almost always order delivery, which is ridiculously yummy, but in-restaurant.. ugh.  i could just die.  it's the cherry on top.  i haven't had their lunch special yet but it is something crazy - your own little pizza and a pop or beer for 5 dollars - something along those lines.",6,5,positive

3328,"I normally hit up Lou Malnati's when I'm in Chicago, but a friend of mine told me this place was better and I had to check it out. So we tried it out - and although it doesn't knock Lou's out of my top spot, it's pretty darn good pizza.The space inside is tight, especially on a cold night when it's packed full of people to the point you can't move without bumping somebody. They don't take reservations but did allow us to register for priority seating at 8:30 - whatever that means. Also - you can put in your order while you wait, which is nice.We ordered a half cheese/half sausage deep dish. They are famous for their caramelized crust. The chef spreads a thin layer of cheese on the outside of the crust, which causes it to have a charred, burned look - and gives it a chewy texture. I liked the texture, but a few pieces were so chewy that it bordered on tough and I had trouble cutting it with my fork.The sausage was flavorful  - I wished it had more on it because it was so good. The sauce was sweet and tasty as well. Overall - this pizzeria didn't make it into my #1 spot, but it was really good, I'd definitely eat it again, and it just might be #2 on my list.",11,4,positive
3329,Probably my favorite deep dish pizza when I visited Chicago! I originally saw this establishment on Food Networks best I've ever had pizza edition and when arriving in Chicago it was a must on my list. So glad I squeezed in some time to try their pie. Had no problem getting a table for 2 on a Sunday around 1:30pm. Pizza takes a little while to make but believe me it's so worth it. Great balance of flavor and oooooozes cheese. Ugh so good!!!,5,0,positive

I LOVE Pequod's - always have and always will.  I guess I had one bad experience, but lesson learned, I have never again ordered the thin crust. The thick is the way to go - green olives & pepperoni - you're all set for a delicious time.",1,4,positive
3331,"Really good pizza. The pan pizza I got is on par, and maybe even better than (depending on your mood), then Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. Service was pretty good; the hostess was friendly, and the waitress was alright. We went right at opening time so we did not have to wait. But, upon leaving (during noon), there started to see an influx of people. The restaurant itself is relatively big with two stories (maybe even more) considering the area it is in. Speaking of the area, I would recommend taking public transportation (about a five-ten minute walk from the Metra Clybourn stop) and/or walking there if you can. There is street parking and parking lot with an adjoining parking garage across the street. However, I am not sure if the parking lot (with various fees) is just for the stores/gym attached to it. The parking garage is strictly for the movie theater.",7,1,positive
3332,"Visiting from Dallas, TX. Everyone says Chicago is known for their deep dish pizza so I have to try some from a local place...& so I have.Got delivery to my hotel, driver said they're not allowed to come to the rooms so I had to go downstairs (I'm calling BS on this one cuz one of the perks of delivery is that you don't have to go anywhere, duh, AND because I delivered pizza in college and that's what we told people when we didn't know our way around a building or were worried about our parking spot...but whatever he was friendly no biggie). I got a personal pan pizza with Italian sausage and it was very good but constructed in the strangest way--Cheese on bottom, flat and round Italian sausage the diameter of the entire pizza on the second layer, and tomato sauce and Parmesan on top. This seemed a little backward to me, and the huge singular piece of Italian sausage is something I've never seen or heard of, but maybe that's how y'all do it here, IDK. Garlic cheese bread was super yummy. Overall great pizza. Wondering if the pizza is really supposed to be prepared upside down though haha.",5,3,positive

3336,I went to Chicago on vacation from Boston and I wanted to experience some authentic deep dish pizza. I tried a couple of the popular chains first (Lou Malnatis and Ginos) and then gave Pequods a try after a recommendation. I thought this was the best of the three. The pizza at Pequods is amazing.

I called and spoke with the manager, she would not give me her name or the young lady who hung up on both of us. I cant understand how a company can be in business when the first point of contact is rude, abrupt and hangs up on customers.

We were so shocked that we could barely process this irrational and belligerent person in ""charge"". I don't know if the owners were taking a night off or something but they left the bitchiest person on staff in charge to drive people away. I'll never be back. I don't care how good the pizza is.

My hubby had the chicken strips appetizer with honey mustard dipping sauce, I wanted to save my appetite for pizza. He said the strips were good but nothing special. For our meal I had the deep dish sausage personal pan with caramelized cheese crust and he ordered a small thin crust with pepperoni, onions and green peppers. I must say mine was awesome, I ate the whole thing. He said his was good and brought a few slices home. The sauce was really good and I liked the crunchy cheese crust.

3347,This review is based solely on the food. The service here was great. Our friend took us to Pequad's as the place to go to for Chicago deep dish pizza while we were in town visiting. While the pizza was very good it didn't really make me a fan of deep dish pizza. I've had similar pizzas to this outside of Chicago. During our visit there was a great debate between whether to go to Pequod's or Lou Malnati's. We ended up settling on Pequod's and I think it was a mistake. Basically I think Pequod's is for people who like sloppy greasy pizza. If that is your thing then I bet you will think Pequod's is one of the best. For my tastes I think Lou Malnati's classic would have been more up my alley. Maybe next time.,6,2,negative

3355,"I think this is the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago.  Granted, I am a tourist and not a Chicago-native, but this pizza beats Giordano, Unos, and Gino's East. I love how the crust is thin and crispy..a deep dish pizza without all the bread.Also, the pizza sauce is just plain tasty.How can you go wrong with a pizzeria with a mascot that boasts a Whale wearing a Thong on its head? =)I dream about this pizza...seriously...it was that good.",2,1,positive
3356,"Pequod's has so much hype... I held it atop a pedestal which may be the reason it kind of fell flat to me. I really enjoy a good deep dish Za' and had to try Pequod's for myself to compare to my other go to spots. For future diners trying to make up your mind on where to order take out tonight... Here are some useful tips: Pequod's pizza is VERY doughy. I liked this but my friends did not. Lots of bread every bight and not very much cheese and little sauce. Big sausage chunks that lacked flavor compared to the sausage LAYER on Lou Malnati's pizza. Giordano's is much cheesier and saucy. So delicious. Definitely far superior to Pequod's. Gino's East is all about the crust and depends on the eater. I am a fan but I know many are not. Lou Malnati's is just crack. So addictive and delicous. To be honest, it's been so long since I've had it and writing this review has prompted me to order Lou's asap.In addition, I didn't get the ""carmelized crust"" that everyone was talking about. My crust was charred and black. If by carmelized, they mean burnt, then yes, I got this. It was not appetizing and I cut it off and threw it into the garbage. In the end, Peqoud's fell short when compared to Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and on par with Gino's East.",7,5,negative
3357,"Pequods is amazing. Its like, what are you pequods? Are you deep dish? Are you not? Your ambiguity intrigues me and I will continue eating excessive amounts of you. Pequods pizza has a very thick layer of dough which i absolutely LOVE. Its not as cheesy as traditional deep dish but just as yummy and filling. They have some good beers and lots of seating(two floors). I knocked a star off because the place can use an upgrade. It looks like 1994 in there.",4,3,positive
3358,"Pequod's was my first experience of authentic Chicago pizza and it was pretty tasty.  Being from NJ, I have a bias towards east coast pizza and Pequod's didn't do anything to change my mind on that debate.  That being said, the sausage ""pizza"" I had was delicious.  The sauce was a little too sweet, but other than that, I really enjoyed everything else.  The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it with exposed brick walls.  If you like the Blackhawks, then this would be a great place to hang out for a game. The is packed with Blackhawks stuff.",8,2,positive
3359,"On our recent trip to Chicago, my husband and I took quite the journey to find ourselves some classic, Chicago-style pizza and I am proud to announce that Pequod's did not disappoint. Is it the best deep dish that Chicago has to offer? I have no idea. But I DO know that after Lou Malnati's was surprisingly closed due to renovations (their loss), Pequod's easily picked up where Lou's left off. Thank you very much.We started with an order of garlic bread. Nothing special, but after our long search it tasted quite good. For our pizza, we stuck with a classic cheese deep dish and it was definitely worth the search. It was everything I'd hoped a Chicago-style pizza would be. Deliciously cheesy with a tangy sauce and crispy crust in all the right places. So so good. After our long walk through random neighborhoods with only an iphone to guide us, I was also surprisingly pleased with the ambiance of the place. Super casual and a bit dark inside. Exactly how a Chicago pizzeria should be. The booths were a little dirty and beat up, but in a good, gritty, Chicago-ish way. Perfect for delving into a pan full of cheese. I really would love to come back again soon...if only we weren't so damn far away.",11,7,positive

While I generally like Art of Pizza as my go to Chicago Deep Dish pizza place, the pizza at Pequod's is in a league of its own. It's not like regular deep dish. Something happens inside those seasoned pans they make the pizza in that makes it so damn good. It's just as ridiculously good delivered too!",5,3,positive

3365,"The place is kind of like a toned down sports bar.  There are TV's showing sports, neon lighted signs advertising various beers, t-shirts for sale at the long bar that extends through most of the 1st floor.  On the day we went it was far from rowdy: there were quite a few couples, a family, etc.We ordered the small deep dish pan with pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms. DELICIOUS!  Really hit the spot.  All the toppings were additional as their default deep dish comes with only cheese.  Each additional topping for a small pan is $1.75 additional. (Price goes up from there for larger pan servings.)The Mostacciolli with roasted garlic herb and olive oil with just okay.  The additional meatballs for $2.75 only gives you two medium sized meatballs.  Free refills on soda.  Some tables the wooden slab that the pizza is put on is in the shape of a whale. CUTE!Small pan is perfect for 2 people of average appetite to share (2 giant men with huge appetites may need more).  Deep dish tastes (at least deep dish from Pequod's) won't taste anywhere near the same leftover so you'll want to try to order only as much as you can finish.  We had leftovers and the next day the juice (not sauce...it really was meat juice/fat or something) from the toppings soaked into the bready crust and made the perfect caramelized crust from the previous day all soggy: blech.",3,0,positive

3367,"Pequod's is not a traditional Chicago Deep Dish like Lou Malnati's, but it is quite possibly the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.The sauce: sweet and zesty. The crust: puffy and crispy on the outside, but there's more...Pequod's pan pizza has caramelized (read: burnt) cheese on the outer crust, which is created by laying slices of cheese up against the inside wall of the pan and letting it run down around the outside of the crust as it rises and bakes (there is no ""sprinkling"" involved).This cheesy, crispy outer char-crust is the reason you come here.When ordering, make sure you order the PAN pizza and not the thin crust. The thin, although not bad (I've had better thin crust), does not have this crunchy cheesy goodness on it's outer crust, and you will leave disappointed, like many New Yorkers seem to have already done on Yelp.Keep the number of toppings to a minimum. I recommend only 2 toppings at a time, but I wouldn't go over 3. Don't go overboard or you will lose the greatness of this pizza in all of the toppings. Avoid anchovies at all costs!My fellow Pequod-a-holics and I have come up with a consensus of good combinations; here are a few of our favorites:Pepperoni and Garlic - You really can't go wrong with this one (My personal favorite).Italian Sausage and Pepperoncini (spicy yellow peppers) - for the people who like a little heat.Italian Sausage and ... just about anything - They have great Italian Sausage at Pequod's.Pepperoni / Sausage combo - best of both worlds.Spinach and Garlic - a classic combo (even better with Italian Sausage).The Heartstopper - You could ask for it by name, but they won't know what the heck you're talking about. This is the only exception to the 3 toppings or less rule. Every meat available goes on this pie (Sausage, Ground Beef, Canadian Bacon, Pepperoni), with the optional addition of fresh garlic, and yes, you do run the risk of not getting the full effect of a Pequod pizza, but ... damn, it's good.You can see pics and read my full review at:realdeepdish.com/2010/03…",17,8,positive
3368,"Hands down, the BEST Chicago style pizza you can get.  I've been to the tourist trap places all throughout the Chicago area.  This IS the place to go when you're in Chicago for Chicago style pizza.The quality of the dough and the toppings is amazing.   I just had a sausage and pepperoni and the quality of the meats is surprising for a pizza place.  Too often pizza places cut corners on the toppings to increase profit margins.  Not this place.  My friends and I were joking that we could all just make a meal of the sausage used for the topping, it was that good.A lot of reviewers here on Yelp talk about the ""crust"".  More specifically, it's the crispy edges of the crust.  I've never seen it done anywhere else, but Pequod's ""burns"" the very edges of the pizza and it produces this toasty, cheesy goodness that defies words.  You will definitely find yourself, finding ways to eat the edges, even after your full.My last visit here was in the summer of 2011 and I've been obsessing over their pizza ever since. I guess it's good that I'm from out of town. otherwise, I'd be here every weekend (and a much larger person to boot).If you're in Chicago, it's worth the 15 minute drive up to get some of this iconic pizza.",4,3,positive

I also seem to get lucky with a parking space right out front a lot of the time.On to the the pizza... I love their caramelized crust. I've seen a few people on here bashing it, but this is really what the pizza is all about. It's pretty thick dough on the bottom which definitely fills you up, but it doesn't dominate the pizza. The cheese and sauce they use taste delicious. I would recommend ordering the pizza with extra cheese since it normally is a bit light on the cheese for my personal preference. I've only tried sausage and pepperoni pizzas, and both toppings are tasty and high quality. The wings are delicious but small. Still, an order is plenty for two people to share.If you are looking for a place to stop in or lunch, I would definitely say this place is worth your time. I can't speak for dinnertime, but it seems like you might have to wait a while for a table at night. Since this place is open late i would love to come by here for some brews and a Blackhawks game.

On my last trip back home, I went to dinner here. We got a large half sausage half pepperoni deep dish. Couldn't believe how good it was. I've always liked my pizza on the crispier side, so this place seems tailor-made for me. They don't use as much tomato sauce compared to Lou's or Due's, and the meat isn't served as it's own layer either. It was well-balanced and the crust seemed like dessert afterward. Whenever I'm home, I'll be getting my deep dish from Peaquod's. Bonus city points if you remember going to Batter Up on Lincoln just a block over back in the day. The projection screen of the pitcher do his wind-up before the ball came out was a class above all other batting cages.

Well....this was my last meal in Chicago and I have to say that this was one of the most memorable of them all.  We came right when it opened and we took advantage of their lunch special, which included a 7"" one topping pan pizza and beer or coke for $5.   Five.  Dollars.I had my pizza with Sausage, Garlic, and Fresh Tomatoes.  Paid only $1 for the extra toppings.  The garlic added some nice flavor to the sauce and it was the best dollar I spent in Chicago.The sauce was great, the pizza had a great crust with a nice crisp, and the ingredients were very flavorful.  It was a great piece of pie and the best we had in Chicago.  If anyone has tried a better pizza in Chicago, then I would love to hear about it.  But this was clearly the best in our trip to the midwest.   So definitely try Gino's and Lou''s to get your own opinion, but don't be foolish by leaving this out of the discussion if you're looking to try the best pizza of Chicago.",16,1,positive

Everyone has their personal choice for pizza and suggesting what's best can be very personal. That said this pizza, for myself and 3 others, was wildly average. The thin crust is not worth your time to even consider. The crust is dry, insulted with excess cornmeal, and the sauce must have pulled a Houdini (disappearing act).  Really, really poor.  The deep dish does not measure to others in the city. Aficionados will quickly distinguish that a wait time of 45 minutes demands excellence - - this does not meet such a metric. As an aside, our dish took nearly 1:45 to create.  No bueno.  Service was actually awful, but I will chalk that up to a busy night. Otherwise, this rating would have received two stars.

There are TV's available to watch sports and the bar area is nice.The Good - Garlick Cheesy bread is a MUST get. It looks like a a philly bread that's split in half and it has their marinara sauce, great amount of garlic, and cheese.  You HAVE to try these!! We had a medium size pan pizza with 2 ingredients and it was reasonably priced. Definitely ask your server what their recommendations are as far how big you want your pizza to be because we didn't listen (and thinking we're hungrier than we actually were) and got the medium, instead of recommended small for me, my husband and a baby.  Service is great and the quality of food is great! I like that they melt mozzarella to their crust that makes that crunchy crust. their home made marinara sauce is really good too!The Bad - I can't say any bad things about this place. Maybe except the bathroom is not all that clean. I didn't think they were going to be baby friendly but they were accommodating and even spent a couple minutes to play with my child.The Bottom Line - If you're interested in a new way of pizza, try this out!

3385,Instant improvement. Called the next day (after Pequods had offered to pick up a pie on the house - although I didn't take them up on the offer). It's like they had done training in the intervening day (or maybe I just had bad luck the day before). First thing they told me was the wait - very helpful and friendly on the phone. Pizza arrived and tasted great - one star subtracted from the solid 4 star delivery because the pizza had been held unevenly and toppings (and pizza) had formed on one side of the box. Didn't effect the delicious taste. Thanks for the great pizza and good luck on turning around the phone etiquette. Still the best deep dish in Chicago.,12,1,negative

While I have a go-to for deep dish, it's not something I typically seek out. Pequods just changed that. They really nailed it. While it's not quite as good reheated, I found myself eating some before bed -and I never do that. The restaurant itself is small and seems more like a bar. The service is a bit slow and forced me to swig off my flask, which no one noticed, for ten minutes before someone got around to us. They have Three Floyds on draft, on rotation, which I immediately ordered hoping for that zombie dust. No such luck but the Scottish ale was decent and complemented my rum very well, which I continued to drink at the table. I was pretty hammered by the time the pizza arrived, but I can assure you it's the  best in its class. Their signature carmelized crust lives up to the hype. I could've eaten a plate of that and been happy, and next time, I just might. Good job Pequod.",10,4,positive

In fact - my fiance and I are having our Rehearsal Dinner at Pequod's next May. We were able to rent out the back room, and for a VERY affordable price, have all you can eat pizza and beer/pop for about 50 guests.Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago, hands down. The crust is carmelized which sets it apart from the competition. The sauce and cheese is fantastic as well. I've had just about every combination of pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, veggie, extra cheese), and I've never been let down. Pequod's also has a decent beer selection and for a good price. The appetizers are good as well (mozzarella sticks!), but I highly recommend not ordering any since the pizza is so good and worth the wait. Pequod's also has carry out and delivery.The atmosphere is very casual and a great place for families, date night, or a night out with a few friends.

3404,"Mmmmm, Pequod's, you never seem to fail me.The best deep dish pizza in Chicago you'll find. A bold and ballsy statement to make, I know, but there is no other place I'd turn to (except maybe Burt's Place in Morton Grove) for true, fresh, and delicious Chicago deep dish pizza.I came here last night for a work outing with nine other people, and Pequod's was extremely accommodating and attentive to our party. Our drinks were never empty and they were quick to take our order and brought the food out promptly after the excruciatingly long wait of 45 minutes for the pizza to bake.The pizza:The pizza here is always consistent and I've never experienced any flukes with their pizza. What makes this pizza so much better than Lou's, Unos, or Giordanos is their caramelized crust. Sure, it sounds weird, but trust me, it's what seals the deal with this pizza. It'll turn any non-crust eater into a believer.They offer a range of different toppings and you can build your own creations. Last night we went with one sausage, one pepperoni, and one ""supreme"" that had mushrooms, peppers, onions, sausage, pepperoni, and black olives. The supreme pizza was annihilated in a matter of minutes, which I chalked up to be due to the extremely fresh and plentiful ingredients that they pile on. I feel that it's worth mentioning that their sausage here isn't the disgusting ""sausage patty"" that lines the pizza, much like what they do at other pizza places. It's real sausage that is in silver dollar sized pieces sprinkled over the pizza.The atmosphere:Kind of loud and typical of any pizza joint. They have two floors so the restaurant is a lot bigger than it appears from the street.The service:They were attentive and fast, as I previously mentioned, but they weren't all that friendly. If anything there is room for improvement here.If you haven't been to Pequods, it's definitely worth checking out to get a taste of their unique take on the crust. Also, it's rarely ever ""packed"" and you won't face a 1-3 hour wait like many of the other pizza places in town. Once you try this, I guarantee you won't be going back to Unos/Due/Lous anytime soon.",22,4,positive
3405,"I love this place. A buddy of mine recommended this place and was completely worth it.Showed up about 9 o'clock and the place was packed, was originally given an hour wait for a table and ended up getting a place sitting at the bar shorty after, which was just as good as having a table for us. Bartenders and wait staff were super friendly and accommodating. Never took long to get new drinks and our water cups were always kept full, which is a huge plus in my book. *Note when we left around 11 this place was maybe half full, so later you come the better.Ordered the cheesy bread which was good, but nothing to write home about. Might recommend them to start serving it with some nacho cheese sauce.However the deep dish pizza here was some of the best pizza I've had in awhile, makes my top 5 list of pizza places. Ended up with a sausage and mushroom pizza and a spinach and mushroom pizza, both were great. Starting with the fresh ingredients, perfect amount of sauce and then the crust, whatever they are doing, they are doing right. Only issue was on one of the pizzas they had a lot of mushrooms all clumped together, but nothing to really complain about.Being a Blackhawks bar, really want to make it in for a game next time I visit. Could see this place getting packed and a great place to watch it with all their tv's and memorabilia. Note I'd definitely be showing up early to either get a table or a good spot at the bar.Only thing that was a little strange that you could see the bartenders routinely going on smoke breaks and the cashier was wearing a bull ring. I guess whatever floats your boat, but I think hurts the professional feel of the place, but guess everybody has to have a little flare.",16,7,positive
3406,"We made a reservation and still waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  The place was packed and I only saw 1 bartender at the bar.  Don't expect your server to have endless conversations or for them them check in with you very often. They are too busy for that.  The pizza was great, we had deep dish with numerous toppings.   One thing I like is a good pizza to reheat for leftovers.  Unfortunately, this pizza just isn't as good reheated.  So, that's really my only major complaint.",4,1,positive
3407,"We came here about two weeks ago after I ran the Chicago Half Marathon. What better way to celebrate running 13.1 miles than by stuffing your face with deep dish pizza!!!We started off with the onion rings. They were huge and very good when dipped in the accompanying barbecue sauce.We ordered the small deep dish pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The pepperoni was nicely toasted and tasted great on the pizza. The pizza had just the right amount of cheese and the crust was very good. The top of the crust is slightly burnt and gives a good taste. This was definitely the best deep dish pizza that I have had in a long time. After only two slices I was totally full.The service was decent, even though they were busy. Food Network was there recording people eating in the restaurant for an upcoming episode. I doubt I will get on t.v., but that was still pretty cool.If you want good pizza, look no further than Pequod's.  We will definitely be back.",13,1,positive
3408,"I didn't enjoy this pizza. The crust was burnt (""carmelized"" my bum ) and there was more sauce than cheese or our toppings. Also, not that we needed alot of it, but this pizza was all bread (deep dish has cheese and toppings) that is like cardboard... burnt cardboard. Basically, we paid for lotsa burnt bread with Ragu sauce. Two stars just because they delivered.",2,1,negative
3409,"I love Pequods Pizza. Anytime someone comes to visit and asks to be taken to get ""Chicago Deep Dish"" I completely ignore their request and take them to Pequods because I love it and I know they will too.That makes this review all that more disappointing to write. I was having an NBA playoffs party this weekend and decided to order a large Pequods for this special occasion. I don't live super close to Pequods so I didn't mind that it took over an hour and a half for the pizza to get there. But the pizza that did arrive was badly misshapen, and cold. As we had been waiting for over an hour and a half, we each grabbed slices and began to eat before we realize that this was a plain cheese pizza we were eating, NOT the pizza we ordered. I called Peaquods to explain the problem. The manager was put on the phone and instead of apologizing,  angrily told me that because we had eaten slices, we would have to PAY for a new pizza to be delivered. When I pointed out that this didn't really make sense, as we had already waited a long time, and the mistake was theirs, she pointed out that ""if we sent you another pizza, then our owner would be out TWO pizzas"" .No apology, no attempt to make it right. Peaquods solution was that we should wait 3 hours for the right pizza and give them back the other pizza so that they could deliver it as well. I don't know what pizza place would be ok with sending a 3 hour old pizza that had been misdelivered and sitting in someone else's house for the night to customers that had been waiting and spending a good amount of money ($30 for one large pizza delivered) for a fresh hot pizza. The manager was beyond rude to me, and insisted that the only way they could get me the correct pizza, was to charge me for it, or have me accept a smaller pizza. We accepted the smaller pizza, and it did not arrive until Midnight, over 3 hours after we initially ordered. I have NEVER been treated so rudely or expected to not only wait on but PAY for a mistake that a restaurant made. I have eaten at Pequods about once a month for years, and as a coach, often take my sports teams there for end of season parties. I hate to say it because I love the pizza so much, but I don't think I'll be going back there again after being treated so poorly and rudely.",11,7,negative

3411,"I'm not one who would typically opt for deep dish pizza, but at Pequod's, it is an absolute MUST. We got there pretty early on a Saturday night, around 5:45, so we had no trouble getting seated, and it was just 2 of us, so they sat us in a little booth against the wall.Took our drink order and they had one of my favorite IPAs (half acre daisy cutter), so I was happy as a clam. Not to mention I was absolutely famished, so I could not wait for our pizza to arrive.And arrive it did...eventually. Like 1.5 hours later. Basically, the story goes that they accidentally served our pizza to another table. They actually cut it up and serve the pizza on plates, so I guess the other table did not realize it was the wrong pizza until it was served up, at which point they could not give it to us. So, they said they would give us 50% off of our pizza...gee, thanks? 50% off of a $10 pizza? Wow, so glad we saved $5. Well, at least that's what was going through my head. BUT, thank god they redeemed themselves and gave us 50% off the small price pizza but actually gave us a large. Which was, in my opinion, a much better deal and much more worthy of the inconvenience we had to sit through. Because....We were on our way to see Hunger Games and I absolutely hate being late to movies. They made it work though and it was all good. They even stored our left overs for us so we could go to the movies and then pick it up on our way home.I subtracted a star because of the wait, but they made up for it, and I would not hesitate to come back here. Totally a splurge since I think 1 slice has got to be like 1,000 calories, but worth it every once in a blue moon :)",11,5,positive
3412,Food still good but very poor service. Plates were dirty and green peppers on pizza still had stickers on them. If they aren't removing stickers are they even washing the produce? It's a shame good food but no quality control. Manager removed pizza from bill will try again.,2,2,negative

3414,"After 1,000+ reviews, I fear my review will fail to add any real value.  However, I am compelled, yes COMPELLED, to offer my two cents.Three friends and I recently decided to grab dinner on a Friday, and one recommended this place.  I was the one that called them up to make a reservation.  Unfortunately, the server had no record of our reservation when we got there (damn you Smart phone, you provided me the wrong phone number).  No problem, there was a nice corner for us to hang out and enjoy a few drinks of The Green Line.  Props for supporting a local brewery.Now, the pizza... I simply cannot describe, in words, how much I enjoyed it.  My expectations were rather low since I am not a fan of traditional deep-dish pizza.  One bite in and my expectations were surpassed.  Three slices later and I became the latest Pequod super-fan.  I now find that it is my duty to introduce everyone I know to Pequod's Pizzeria.",5,5,positive
3415,"Okay, admittedly I love pizza. You have to have some pretty crappy pizza for me to write a terrible review. Some might say that I'm a bit of a pizza connoisseur, others might say I'm merely a patron. Nonetheless, Peqoud's is TRUE CHICAGO pizza. I feel like a real Chicago native when I'm in this lovely establishment. It's super divey, but not in a creepy, dusty way. It's simply dark enough and loud enough to feel like you're apart of something bigger than yourself. That thing that is bigger is an overwhelming pizza experience. The crust is perfectly caramelized, and the sauce is a lovely combination of tangy and sweet. I'm just saying, you have to go to this pizza place if you want to feel apart of Chicago.

3416,"After hearing all the hype on Pequod's, I dragged my family there on our last trip to Chicago in lieu of Hot Doug's (can't convince them to line up for hot dogs, no matter how good they are!). What we discovered was a dark dive-lite atmosphere and OK pizza. The hallowed burnt cheese crust was not the umami bomb I was expecting and the toppings were pretty watery (don't order mushrooms!). Not bad but I will stick with Malnati's in future.",4,5,negative
3417,"I moved to Chicago from Canada a few months ago and a lot of my friends have been visiting the last couple months (the summer months... not the winter months, they don't even know my name during the winter months). Whenever one of them visits, they request 'the best deep dish' in Chicago. I've tried about 15 different pizza places since i've been here and although a lot are close, and ALWAYS delicious; Uno, Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, I have to say, they all lose their shit over Pequod's. The toppings are plentiful and always taste fresh, the tomato sauce is signature and their crust is unlike anything i've had, it's caramelized and impossible not to finish (I usually never finish the crust).* During Peak hours, there's about an hour wait, The Drinking Bird next door to Pequod's has great cocktails!",5,2,positive
3418,"was REALLLLY close to 5-star status here, but 2 things prevented me from giving into my baser pizza-craving instincts:1. this place gets PACKED. like, really packed, even for Chicago. 2 hour waits on weekend nights are not out of the question.2. These guys crank out 'zas in volume, which means sometimes they make a mistake or two.  Unfortunately, this happened last time i was there - waited 1.5 hrs to get in, then 40 mins for pizza, only to have the wrong order come out.  She was great and put in an individual pizza for free to make up for it, but was kind of a bummer.PRO TIP: if you're waiting for a table for a while, head next door to the Drinkingbird.  Great little place to get a beer or a craft cocktail while you're waiting, and the buzzer Pequod's gives you will still work at that range.now let's get to the good stuff:  the pizza is truly phenomenal. I used to be a dead-to-rights Giordano's guy, having grown up south of Chicago.  This is different - not stuffed pizza like Giordano's, not really ""deep dish"" like Gino's east - more of a true ""pan pizza"" a la Lou Malnatis. However i much prefer Pequod's to LM's because of the crush and the way the cheese bakes in the pan.  Sausage lovers - welcome to paradise.  This sausage - even by chicago standards - is the best i've had.",12,2,positive

Carmelized crust was nothing special and speaking of crust...there was so much bread and not good bread either. I don't know how this dough is prepared but I'm not a fan. The reason I gave it 2 stars is there was a lot of sauce (which I like) and they were generous with the pepperoni and mushrooms. Go to Lou's or Giordanos...even though they are chain restaurants they still have great deep dish and thin crust pizza.",6,1,negative
3428,"Honestly, the pizza is not good. I've gone twice, and have been disappointed both times. The crust and sauce are entirely too sweet, and the dough is far too crispy for deep dish. The ambience, too, is really blah--generic sports decor. The only reason they got two stars and not one is because the lunch special is so cheap, making it a great choice for college students with low standards.",3,3,negative
3429,"This thing smelled so freakin good when we picked it up. We delightfully inhaled the smells during the car ride to our eating spot. To be honest, the first bite was kind of disappointing. It was decent, but no where near as good as it smelled. What happened??? The crust was kind of dry -- maybe intentional? The sauce was not as plentiful as it needed to be with that kind of crust. And the sausage was super bland. It looked like it was made by hand, which I love, but the taste was non-existent. Sad, so very sad.",9,6,negative
3430,"This is more of a catch up review from last year.The girl friend at the time and I went to Pequods as a reference from her sister. Our first time there our pizza didn't taste very good, crust was cracked, and the waitress was rude. We figured that maybe it was just a busy night because every restaurant was swamped because of the Hawks game at the time so we tried a second time a week later. The food came out even worst the second time and looked almost inedible. When asked to replace or remake the food we received attitude/disgust from the waitress (not the same one) about it, and she even had the audacity to complain when we didn't leave a tip.Not sure if its because we ordered thin crust at a deep dish pizza place, but the now fiance and I both agreed we'd never go back to Pequods if given a choice again.Edit! Found the original review from last summer!My girl friend and I went here twice. The first time our food was drastically under cooked so we figured we give it a second time before making a final judgement on the establishment. The second time was worst. Our food had little to no sauce, disintegrated as we attempted to pick it up, and our waitress acted as if the work she was doing beneath her.Pequod's overall is your typical garbage college pizza bar with overpriced food, questionable quality of food, and horrendous service. If located anywhere else that wasn't a ""college town"" Pequod's wouldn't last more than a year before going out of business. Its a shame that ""today's youth"" find such a place desirable.",3,12,negative

I hear that it gets very crowded in the weekends. We got the mozzarella sticks which was a tad too salty for my palate. But the cheese was stringy and delicious. I loved tomato sauce and the cheese in the deep dish but there was something off. We got an assortment of veggie toppings (olives, peppers, jalapeños, tomato, basil and spinach). The crust wasn't bad either but something was off, and the whole thing together did not taste sumptuous.. just ok.",3,2,negative

3440,"I went to Pequod's pizza because I like unique restaurants and I heard about the caramelized crust. We walked into a dimly lit room very reminiscent of a bar. I have tried many different deep dish places during my stay in Chicago and have to admit that Pequod's is unique.We got a deep dish with peppers and pineapples (goes against the cardinal rule of getting sausage or pepperoni with pizza, but I hadn't seen pineapple offered in deep dish before). It was very pleasant, but not typical deep dish pizza.It was much lighter than most pizzas. There wasn't that much cheese, in all honesty. The crust made up a lions share of the pizza. The cheese was not much more than you would get at a typical carry out pizza place (like Papa Johns) and the toppings were clearly added as an afterthought rather than being cooked in (maybe the pineapple wouldn't have done well to be baked for so long, but I was kind of disappointed). The caramelized crust had a slightly unique taste, but it was an aftertaste rather than an overpowering flavor (honestly, not worth going just for the crust).Maybe I got an off day, but I wasn't overly impressed. It was pleasant and I felt much better than I normally do after eating deep dish, but this is because they seem to skimp on cheese. If you are dieting or don't want to feel bloated, this could be a good deep dish place for you.The service was fine and the place was clean. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.

3445,"Let's put it out there, I LOVE PIZZA!!! OK, now that I got that taken care of, here's my humble review. I've always thought that food reviews are kind of a waste, since food is so subjective. Kinda like choosing a favorite color. If you like green, who am I to argue??? I really wanted to like Peaquod's pizza, but it wasn't in the cards. I placed a phone order for delivery, and almost 2 hours later, I get a phone call from the driver. He had the wrong address. Luckily it was only one digit off, so he was across the street. I brought the pizza (thin crust pepperoni) inside and opened the box. The pizza was barely warm, but the amount of pepperoni was very generous (the only reason I didn't rate a single star). Since it was in the drivers car so long, the crust was soggy. Maybe they're better (crispy crust?) if you order and eat in the restaurant....  After several bites, my disappointment began to ferment. It was extremely bland, totally lacking flavor. (No, my taste buds weren't on vacation). I'm used to pizzas with some seasoning, this was just crust, cheese, sauce and crust. No flavoring at all. I'm still going to to try their deep dish, the caramelized cheese looks enticing. But the combination of a long wait time and no payoff has me deeply disappointed.  I'll update after my next pizza, hopefully it will redeem Peaquod's. If not, Chicago is full of quality pizza joints, my money will be spent elsewhere.   Peace....",10,5,negative

The first time was too long of a wait. We went early the second time around and were seated right away. We order both, a full deep dish and thin slices while we waited. The slices were horrible, so we couldn't figure out why this place was so packed all the time and quite honestly, were not too excited to get our pizza... But boy  were we wrong.

3457,"Love the pizza. Seriously. Delicious. Customer service though? Woof. Twice now they've disappointed hard when I showed up with friends (lost reservations, rude host and waitstaff). I usually recommend everyone come here when they visit Chicago, but I'm not sure that's going to happen any more. May be time to explore new deep dish options!",1,3,negative
3458,"This place has a fiercely loyal following that consider it the second-coming of ""Chicago-Style"" pizza. That said, having grown up in Chicago, I can remember the glory days of the great deep-dish restaurants: Uno's, Duo's, Gino's East, and Lou Malanati. In the 1970s, these were temples to the deep-dish style pizza that Chicago has unfortunately become known for. Today, Pequods has become the underground go-to place of a new generation.I ate there last week on the recommendation of someone I trust to know about good food and who has a deep appreciation for this place. Three adults and a 4 year old went to a late lunch on a weekday. The service was a bit slow and awkward. I am not sure if the server was new, inexperienced, snobby, or just lazy nor do I care. First ding to service.We ordered two deep fried appetizers: mushrooms and zucchini. We also order two bowls of soup as appetizers: minestrone type soup and a potato soup. The deep fried zucchini were straight from freezer burn to deep fryer burn and were simply awful. The mushrooms by comparison were also frozen but at least properly cooked. The potato soup was boring and odd. The other soup was actually good. The terrible tasting deep fried zucchini took an extraordinary amount of time to burn and bring to the table. Second ding to appetizers.The table had become quite cluttered with dishes, silverware, paper, etc. and the server simply ignored it and also refilling our drinks. Second ding to the server.We then had the lunch special of a small deep dish pizza with a drink for around $5.95. The pizza was more than enough food to satisfy even a large appetite, despite its relatively small size; it was very dense. Two pizzas came with pepperoni, one with mushrooms, and one with plain cheese. The pepperoni (meat itself) was good quality. The ring of the crust was burnt in a caramelized manner. Interesting and strange. The pizza was good in an addictive way. Each bite demanded another. Not being a deep-dish fan (Chicago has always been a thin crust town except for the tourists and suburbanites), I was surprised I ate it all. The pizza was about half as deep as a classic Chicago-Style and the ingredients were fresh. ,The bill was wrong and needed to be corrected which required actually getting up and finding the server. If there was a manager present, it wasn't apparent. To round off the experience, I was in the men's room with one of the waiters (they all wear the same shirt) who left the room without washing his hands. I swear this is true as shocking as it is.This place is not for me. Apparently, not for my wife either, who had indigestion for a day and a half.",15,22,negative
3459,"I get the Pequod's love. It's not just the pie, which has plenty to recommend it; it's the whole experience. You walk in the door and you know you're in a pizza joint. It's kinda dark, it's kinda noisy, the tables are kinda jammed together. And it *smells* like pizza. Walking in the door takes me back to the places I used to frequent in the 70s, like the old My Pie in Rogers Park. Back before pizza became respectable.Then there's the crust. Is it caramelized or is it burnt? They call it caramelized, and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Because whatever it is, it's freakin' delicious. You get the same thing in an upscale restaurant, and they call it ""parmesan lace."" It's baked cheese, and it's terrific.The crust is pretty thick, as you would expect from pan pizza, and the toppings are plentiful, if a little erratic. Which is to say, slice one, where's the pepperoni?; slice two, loaded with it. The sauce was nothing special, but everything worked together to create a fine pie.Service was quick and friendly. The best part: they asked if we wanted to put in our order right away, before they had a table for us, so the pizza could get started. Nice touch. But they didn't rush us out at the end. I'm still at 4 stars, but I get why people give it 5.",15,3,positive
3460,"As a general rule, I judge a neighborhood by the accessibility to good pizza.  Months ago, when I rediscovered Pequod's, I was relieved with my decision to buy my first home in this area.  Phew!I love the thin crust pizza with its perfect combination of sauce and toppings.  Plus, I LOVE the fat, buttery crust!This place gets REALLY busy.  If you are starving and want to sit right away, your chances are pretty good before 6:30pm.I will definitely be back to try the deep dish.  Stay tuned!",6,1,positive

3464,"Pequod's used to be one of my favorite deep dish pizzeria, 10 years ago. However, the past 3 or more times, it was very disappointing. I've been embarrassed by recommending them for a company party and also when I had friends from NYC visiting, as I described Peqod's as one of the best. They used to be known for their deep dish pizza, but now it is just a thicker crust pizza with a little sauce and minimal cheese on top. It's a shame that such a previously good establishment is starting to skimp out and making what I used to have pride in as a huge mistake. After the past 3 times, I am sticking to Giordano's. Lou Malnati's is also skimping a little bit, but not as much as Peqods. Their deep dish is best described as an extra thick pizza dough with a little marinara, sausage, and cheese on top.",7,3,negative
3465,This is a great deep dish pizza... Kinda reminds me of pizzarea UNO... But better... Nice crisp cheese all the way up the crust... Fresh sauce... Lots of toppings.... Beware this pizza is heavy... One to two slices and your done for hours... Tastes great even cold...,4,1,negative
3466,Pizza was good but we waited over an hour and :45 to eat. Not worth that kind of wait. Service was ok at best. Kitchen was SLOW and the management non-existent. Place was filthy dirty too.

3475,"In my quest to find the best deep dish pizza in the city I came to Pequod's. It was recommended by a friend who has lived in the city for many years so when I had a set of friend's visit that wanted to try some authentic deep dish pizza I knew exactly where I wanted to take them.  However, after eating at Pequod's it will not be my go to place for friends visiting the city. Yes, it was good but it's not making my top three list of recommended pizzerias. I understand the idea of the signature carmelized cheese crust but it comes down to you either like it or not and I did not like it (too much crunch in a bite). In addition, there was an enormous amount of cheese on the pizza, one of the guys in the group loved that about it. My preference in pizza is one that has more sauce and toppings than cheese. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 4 and the place was packed, packed with families that is. I was a bit surprised by the amount of small children that were there since there is quite a large bar area upstairs and downstairs. We were escorted upstairs to a booth and I was happy there were three of us because had there been only two, we would have been sat in the middle of the room. It's an odd place for a table because the waiters and waitresses are scurrying down the aisles to bring food to the customers and take orders. We actually saw a couple leave because they were displeased with their seating arrangement. Our waitress was great but we kept getting appetizers and pizzas delivered to our table that we did not order so there had to be some kind of mix-up going on in the kitchen.",11,1,negative

Pequods deep dish is not too saucy, and very cheesy. The cheese is baked to a crispy brown and carmelized on top, not too much bread. They have the best balance of ingredients that will make your mouth water until the last bite.

3482,"This one star is for the service and lack of response I got when I shared my experience. The pizza is amazing so it makes me sad to share this. I wrote the below email to the Pequod's general email listed on their website. I have received NO RESPONSE, so I am posting to yelp. I am more disappointed in their lack of acknowledgement than the original bad experience. I probably won't ever go there again. Their pizza is good, but there is a lot of other good pizza in this city. Hi There,After my experience yesterday, 1/18, I feel compelled to write and let management know about the poor service that my party received.First of all, I want to be clear that the food was great, and neither myself or anyone else in my party of 4 had ever experienced poor service at Pequod's prior to this, even in circumstances where the restaurant was MUCH busier.  This is why I am writing to you, the company, directly instead of posting on Yelp.  I don't feel like my experience accurately reflects your restaurant as a whole, and that this was one unfortunate instance.We arrived around 3pm on Sunday, 1/18.  We were a party of 4, and two of us arrived about 10 minutes later than our friends.  We found our friends and discovered they were seated at a table at the very back of the restaurant that stuck out in the path of the staff's way to the kitchen.  This table should not exist.  The people on one side are uncomfortably close to the table of the booth behind them, and the people on the other side are in the path of the staff's way to the kitchen, and get run into, or accidentally bumped over and over again as people are rushing by.  Perhaps this table should be removed.We sat down, and our friends who had been there before us had drinks from the bar, but had not been attended to by a server, or offered water.  After several minutes, we had to flag down a server and ask to be served drinks.  My husband received his draft beer which he said tasted funny, as if the lines of the keg hadn't been cleaned recently.  He decided to drink it anyway, and did not complain.We ordered, and proceeded to wait at least 45 minutes for our pizza.  We didn't mind so much as we expected the pizza to take awhile, had good company, and were watching the football game.  What we did mind was that our server never took initiative to ask if we wanted more drinks, even though beer glasses stood empty for at least 15-20 minutes.  We then heard the table next to us ask about their pizza, as they had been waiting over ONE HOUR for their pizza.  We then noticed a booth open up and asked our server if we could switch to the booth in order to get out of this cramped and uncomfortable table.She said yes and kindly helped move us to the booth.  After we moved, my husband had to ask after about 10 minutes for the beer he had ordered at the other table. Our server said ""Oh yea!"" and went to fetch the beer.  After that we had no contact with our server for another hour.Someone else brought out our pizza.After that, no one stopped by our table to ask how it was, if we needed anything, to ask if we wanted anything else to drink, to clear our dirty plates, or anything in general.  We never ordered more drinks because no one stopped by to ask if we needed any.  The interesting thing is that there were plenty of people working there!  Kitchen staff, pizza runners, table bussers, bartenders.  There were at least 10 different people whizzing by us constantly but it was like we were invisible.  Myself and my friend both made eye contact with our server a couple of times hoping she would come over, but she never did.  At last we had to flag down our server to ask if we could pay. She looked surprised, then laughed and explained she thought we'd paid already, and that she'd forgotten that we'd moved tables, and that the ordering/billing system said our table was paid.  She said  we could've walked out of there and she would have never known we didn't pay!After she explained this, her lack of attention made a little bit of sense, but still didn't account for the fact she hadn't even asked us if we needed anything.  If a table sits there for an hour after you think they've paid, wouldn't it make sense to ask them if they had decided to order anything else? It was also odd to us for her not to remember moving a table in the middle of her shift.To make matters worse, she did not apologize, or even REALIZE that she had been ignoring us for an hour.  She just laughed, dropped off our check, and said have a nice day.  This was pathetic service, and therefore we left a pathetic tip.I looked for her name on the bill, but it wasn't listed.  She was a short woman with very short dark hair.  The purpose of this email is just to let management know what terrible service we were provided, especially in light of our normal good experiences we have a Pequod's, in hopes that you will address it appropriately.Thank you,Sara",15,15,negative
3483,"O-M-G Yelp, check out that deep dish! It is sooooo tasty! My neighbor referred it to me, and there is no turning back. I like Pequod's Pizza and I cannot deny. (Are you awake now?) In an elevator of our building, we smelled and learned about Pequod's Pizza. The neighbor said, ""You have to try it. It's one of the best."" And three hours later as I was enjoying a deep dish slice, I had to agree. . .So I had a second slice. I think my deep dish craving is satisfied. . .for now. I have had three deep dish pizzas in Chicago and this is by far my favorite. I even convinced my boyfriend, a Giordano's fan, to cross over to Pequod's. He said, ""I never thought I like a deep dish more than Giordano's and now, I do!"" What are you waiting for? Call Pequod's Pizza now!",6,2,positive

3486,"The décor is bordering on the ""no frills"" side of nothing too fancy. That said cut a place some slack it's a pizza joint. We were a bit disappointed at the lack of seating or waiting room for an advertised wait of nearly 30 minutes, but we lucked out and quickly got to sit at our table upstairs after navigating the scary dark stairs leading to a somewhat cozy dining room brimming with people.We ordered a beer and a frighteningly overpriced glass of red wine and set about looking at appetizers. We finally settled on the ""Pequod's Salad"" and some hot wings. For our pizza, we opted to go with beef, onions, and pepperoni. Our salad was about what you expect from a salad at a pizza place, they had a few pieces of shaved provolone, some chunks of cured meat, onions, and some crisp if not tasteless iceberg lettuce, the wings were devoured in no seconds flat and tasted like pretty much all hot wings, decently spicy, hot, tangy, slightly crispy...in other words, I liked em.Our Pizza was slow in getting there but once there was piping hot and pretty good. Having few points of comparison, I would say that the mozzarella cheese was pretty good if maybe not layered on as thick as I would have liked. The sauce was not very spicy, a little bit sweet but had some good herbal flavor to it. The crust was crispy throughout and the dough was buttery and satisfying.Speaking of the crust, the main issue many people have with Pequod's is the outer edge of the crust. In the baking process, the cooks stuff the edges of the pan with cheese to create a slightly burnt ring of cheese on the crust. This happens to also be what many people, your writer included, really loved the most about this pizza. Fortunately for us, my better half was not a huge fan of it and so I got to eat her pizza crust...:) match made in heaven.:)The service was not overly enthusiastic to get us out despite still having a nearly hour long wait to eat. Our server was polite, prompt, and appropriately cheerful for slinging pizzas.  In conclusion, the décor was nothing to boast about, seating was tight, and price point a bit too high for what we got (seriously 10 bucks for a glass of house wine?), but the service was good and the Pizza was pretty good and that counts for a lot. The Pizza really could have used spicier sauce and a bit more cheese but that burnt cheese crust was something everyone should try at least once if they live here or are nearby enough to make a stop.Not that I have had a lot of Deep Dish but so far this one slightly edges out the others (sorry Uno's your dough was still raw), and that earns it the best grade to date.  Overall: B",30,7,positive

Here's a bit of my review of the other location where the staff and clientele are mature, courteous, and respectful:Surprisingly, deep dish pizza is not a common as you would expect for Chicago.

Came here for a date during Blackhawks season (not sure if that was a good idea) and they happen to be playing at the same time (Go Hawks!) This place was a serious deep dish pizza spot mixed with a sports bar. If you lived in Chicago, you probably have had Lou Malnati's Pizzeria and Giordano's Pizza which are both GREAT traditional Chicago deep dish pizza however Pequod's Pizza takes it to another level with a caramelized deep dish pizza crust. Do NOT let that crust scare you. The burnt cheese caramelized crust is amazing! Let's not forget about the rest of the pizza! They build their deep dish pizza just as good as Lou Malnati's Pizza and Giordano's Pizza. A small deep dish pizza comes out to be 4 slices of heaven and just right for two people. Throw down on some local beer and your meal will be perfect! The original location is in Morton Grove which still exist today. It is also a smaller place but not as busy as the Chicago location. Wait times at the Chicago location can get up to 2 hours specially when there is a game playing. They do not take reservations but BEST TIP is to call ahead and put your name on the waiting list. The service was great and they were on top of everything even when they were busy with a wait at 2+ hours. Great vibe in the place especially when there is a game on. You cannot even tell they had a fire in the place at one point (January 2006) which they shut down for six months to rebuild. Be glad they did rebuild because it is amazing pizza that would be missed. I would bring everyone here including folks from out of town (which I have!) Small groups might be good but large groups might be difficult. It might be a little rowdy to come here on a date during a game but it would be worth it if they are into Chicago teams. Impress them by calling ahead and passing up the line when you get there! If you had to wait, it is totally worth it.

3499,"Going to cut to the cheese ( haha, i made a funny) ..because honestly, im going against the grain by negating such good reviews. I really really get excited to go to pizza joints because pizza is my LIFE. YES, ill even eat subway's pizza, its that pathetic. That being said, dont hate me for my average review.Appeteizer: We got the pizza bread. Do you know what ELIOs pizza is? If you don't, its the one that comes in a box and is almost always on sale at every grocery store. The pizza bread here was along those lines. I think i prefer elios, that way i know how much i want to melt my cheese, or how crispy i want it. Or if im feeling fancy, i may put it in the oven. The pizza bread here  didnt taste good at all. The cheese was not melted right and the bread tasted old. 1 Star.Pizza: It was AVERAGE. The dough was nice and hot, it was okay, and i enjoyed the fact that the pizza had multiple layers of cheese and dough. The sauce tasted like it came right out of the can and the dough was kinda bland. But the very end of the pizza, the crust.... CARAMELIZED CRUST-the saving grace of this pizza. The carameilized crust was PHENOMENAL and if they made the entire pizza dough with that taste, i would be in heaven. They need to sell the crust and make it an appitizer on its own, with some melted cheese , semi burning. YUM. So, i wont be returning for the pizza.Service: crappy. The waitress never came around to fill our waters. There was one obnoxious server who kept laughing like a hyena and it was really annoying. All the servers were just chillin by the bar serving their own. IDK, didnt like it. She finally came around to fill our water when the pizza came.Overall: OVERHYPED PLACE. You are paying money just for the crust ( which is amazing and why this place even got 3 stars) . Do not buy a t shirt, its not worth it. Go to PIECE on Chicago Ave instead.",17,6,negative
3500,Best deep dish in Chicago. Get extra sauce.,0,0,positive
3501,"The other hyped Chicago eatery that just doesn't measure up.A problem that I've had with Chicago deep dish is the fact that there is always a tremendous amount of food, but the quality just isn't there. My weapon of choice was sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese (a standard for every new pizzaria I try). It wasn't bad, but once again there was a lot of stuff and nothing stood out. The sausage was missing and tasted cheap, the pepperoni lifeless and when it comes to the cheese my friend said it the best when I told him there was extra cheese; ""oh extra cheese? I didn't even think there was any on there!""This was not because it was lacking(IMO I considered it only enough for a normal order), but because it had no flavor. The crust is a more crumbly recipe, rather than the more traditional doey. I didn't mind the texture, but it was too thick in comparison to everything else and lacked personality. The sauce, as with the theme with everything else. was plain and boring.This was actually probably the pizza I enjoyed the least in Chicago, despite supposedly being the best.

Pequod's pizza is the kind of experience that can turn a horrible, life-crushing day into one that you'll want to remember fondly. Just the right combination of sauce, cheese, and burnt bits to make all of your problems melt away for a few moments.",3,2,positive
3503,"I have mixed feelings about Pequod's to be honest. I, in no way, shape or form think this is the best deep dish Pizza in Chicago. I'll start my review off with what I liked first though.Every square inch of my Pizza was crammed with toppings. More often than not, when it comes to Pizza toppings, your left wondering where the hell are all the toppings I payed for. Fortunately at Pequod's this is not the case. The Pizza was well done and you could tell everything was pretty fresh. The Pizza held together well and had a great balance of toppings, sauce and crust.The crust was great right up until the burnt portion of it. I'm sorry but i'm not a fan of burnt crust or caramelized cheese. The sauce really wasn't as flavorful as I would like. Those were my two biggest draw backs to an otherwise great Pizza.",12,2,positive

3506,"Within minutes of landing from NYC we had our target set for Chicago does best, Deep Dish Pizza. We had picked this place to branch out from the more ubiquitous spots that will remain nameless. Seated immediately and served with a smile we ordered up our pizza selection.  We got a small with sausage and 1/2 mushroom.  The pizza came out roughly 15 minutes later piping hot and was placed on the wood scrap trivet adorned on every table.  The server dished up each of us a slice.  The ""caramelized"" cheese around the edges gave it a unique texture but no burnt taste.  The pizza was a step above all the other deep dish pie I have ever tried in this fair city. The mushrooms made it a little messier but well worth it.  We even had a slice left between the two of us.  So I am snacking on it now during this review.  So glad to have tried this place.  The service was super friendly and very attentive.  They have a large selection of beers and a bunch of tvs on both floors.  So you can catch sports while dining if you need that sort of thing.  Yeah Pequod's!  Looking forward to maybe another round before I leave this great city of culinary delights.",11,1,positive
3507,"Some friends were raving about how awesome the pizza here is so I got some to go. IT'S NOT DEEP DISH PIZZA! It's basically pizza bread with too much sauce that's just meh, and a beautifully caramelized crust with minimal cheese.  Super disappointing.",2,2,negative
3508,"This is the best pizza I've ever had.  I took a picture of it, and I show that picture to strangers I meet on my travels.  Not like, ""Oh those are your kids?  Let me show you a picture of my deep dish.""  More like, ""Oh you're going to Chicago?  You HAVE to eat at Pequod's... lemme show you something.""The crust (oh, the crust!) is a chewy, buttery, jewel of a treat in and of itself, and is what stands out the most.  It is not the floury, floppy NYC crust with the fabled magic mineral-water flavor of which I'm fond, and it's not the behemoth uber deep dish pie that people associate with Chicago.  It's more like a Pizza Hut deep dish on roids.  I can't believe I'm going to say Pizza Hut in a Pequod's review, but it is the easiest way to describe the general shape of the pizza.  Either way, Pizza Hut, you're welcome.Cheese, sauce, toppings are all strong enough to hold their own as well.  Just do yourself a favor, (stop me if you've heard this) if you are going to Chicago you HAVE to eat at Pequod's.  Sure, if you have time- check out the John Hancock building and Millennium Park, but by all means, get Pequod's.",11,0,positive
3509,"By recommendation of a local bartender, my family and I had trekked out to Pequod's for some deep dish pizza. It was relatively dead on a Sunday around 3 pm. I don't want to say that the service was bad, but the waitress seemed like she vould care less. Rarely came to check up on us. The bus boy and another gentleman (manager?) came to check on how we were doing and they were both much nicer and more pleasant. I'm not quite sure about the caramalzied crust that everyone was talking about. There wasn't that much of a crust, and it wasn't that good. The pizza is mostly dough, like another person had mentioned. The crust at Lou Manalti's was much better, but Pequod's toppings were phenominal. They were fresh, big pieces, and all over the pizza. If only we could combine the two!",8,2,positive

3511,"After seeing too many Food Network / Cooking Channel / Travel Channel shows featuring the competition of Chicago-style deep dish pizzas at Pizzeria Uno and Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend and I decided that we should engage in the discussion as well and visit both locations.  We agreed that we would get one fried appetizer dish, one medium deep-dish pepperoni pizza, and soda. (Dessert only if we felt we could truly handle it.)So here's the experience at Pequod's Pizzeria (our third stop of the two):That's right, we were convinced to add a 3rd contender to our ultimate deep-dish competition.  Who convinced us?  Food Network magazine.  They had a special in a recent issue about the best pizza in every state, and we jumped to Illinois to find out if Food Network chose Uno or Lou, and we read that...  what the heck is a ""Pequod's Pizzeria""??We hit the 'net, and found out that on my two recent trips up to Webster to hit up Barnes & Noble and the awesomeness of Five Guys, I was walking RIGHT PAST this place.Well at about 4:30pm on a Sunday, we changed all that and entered the building for supposedly the best deep-dish 'zza Chicago has to offer, complete with caramelized cheese on the crust for that extra-savory flavor.Well, we got ourselves a seat and thumbed through the menu for our fried appetizer.  Boom!  Appetizer Combo: sign us up!After Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend had finally come to terms with fried zucchini, and these slices o' veggie were quite good.  She enjoyed the mozz sticks, since I'm the only fried mushroom fan.  They were quite tasty as well.  Poppers on an appetizer platter is just icing on the cake - good choice, Pequod's!And with proper timing, our pizza arrived.  Now THIS was the kind of deep-dish pepperoni pizza I was expecting.  The pepperoni had a great flavor and lovely crispiness to them.  The sauce was a FREAKIN' SAUCE!  Barely any chunks of tomato to be found!  I was in heaven!  And then the crust, with the caramelized cheese (which is a very fancy term for ""we just throw some extra cheese on the crust so it gets burnty/crunchy in the oven"") really does make all the difference, especially with the level of butter you can tell went into the dough.My only qualm with the pizza was the ratio of dough to everything-else-that-isn't-dough on the pizza.  I enjoy a really hearty and thick slice of pizza when I go for deep dish, but the thickness of the bottom dough/crust was getting to me after the second slice.  I couldn't even finish the third slice, which is frankly an embarrassment for a man of my rotund stature.  All that remained of the third slice was a mound of crust and dough with the flesh and sauce stripped off and consumed.Yet another round of deep-dish-pizza hilarity that would not allow room for a dessert.But before I leave you with the score, I have to mention the ""unique"" atmosphere of this place.Pequod's Pizzeria is, in my opinion, an Inside Joke.  The kind where somebody at the table says something that makes no sense to you, but everyone around you is snickering or cracking up and tells you that ""you just had to be here"" or ""it's a Jersey thing"" or some other excuse as to why you won't understand the joke.  That's how it felt here.  And at the center of it all is a mascot whale with a pair of panties on its head, just staring you in the face and DARING you to ""get the joke"".  And I didn't.  The metaphor extended to the waitstaff, who seemed to be enjoying conversations with each other more than with the patrons of the establishment.  I would NOT  say that we had bad service.  Not at all.  But after refilling our soda, our server would hang out at the bar with the bartender or the register with some other staff, making comments to each other and yukking it up in general.(There's also a mysterious second floor, which I believe it just extra seating.  I was intrigued, but grateful to be on the first floor and not having to entertain the thought of navigating steps with a tummy full of doughy, cheesy 'zza.)Near the end of the meal, I just had to try and get an explanation.  I pulled our server over and just flat-out asked, ""So why is the mascot a whale with a pair of panties on its head?""""I don't really know - I think it was created by the owner or something.  But it's pretty cool, I think.""Well, maybe the Inside Joke is just the simple fact that you're not able to know why the punchline is funny.  I agree it's kind of a humorous idea of putting panties on the head of a whale, but they would either have to be unthinkably-large panties or an unthinkably-small whale.  I still don't get it...But what I do get is that it's no joke that Food Network magazine made the right choice, because Pequod's Pizzaria hand-down beat out both Lou Malnati's and Pizzeria Uno in our deep-dish pizza competition.",22,12,positive

3518,"I'm Chicago born and raised, but have always preferred thin crust pizza over pan.  That is, until I found Pequod's.  I define their pan as ""died and gone to heaven.""  Sober, hungover, drunk...it's always amazing.  We probably order Pequod's delivery once a week, but nothing beats going in and getting it fresh out of the oven.  The sauce is perfect, with a little hint of sweet.  Depending on our mood, we usually go with sausage or pepperoni.  You can't go wrong either way.  The sausage is fresh, with a taste of fennel, and comes in big chunks all over the pie.  The pepp has a little kick, which really adds to the depth of flavor.  And not enough can be said about the ""carmelized"" cheese crust.  Man, I wish they could somehow create a crust appetizer, because I'd order that in addition to the pizza.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.There are also a handful of standout appetizers.  I'm not sure where they get their frying oil from, but they serve up the crunchiest jalapeno poppers with out-of-this-world creamy ranch.  I haven't found a better popper...and trust me, I've tried.  Onion rings with BBQ sauce or wings are other favorites. If you haven't been, go now.  Other Chicago style pizza joints don't stand a chance.  I heart you Pequod's.",10,3,positive

3520,I didn't like this as much as I anticipated.  I ordered a large cheese deep dish and it certainly wasn't bad but it didn't really tickle my fancy either.  I prefer a denser crust and a brighter/fresher tasting sauce (i.e. still has the bite from fresh tomatoes).  This pie has a very light crust that is more bread-like than crust like and the sauce is a low and slow cooked sauce that is heavy on the oregano.  The kind of sauce that is better suited for pasta than pizza.  Obviously this is just my opinion and it seems that a lot of people really love this stuff so I am in the minority but if you have similar tastes as I do you may be a bit disappointed as well.,9,3,negative

The appetizers were wonderful, and the pizza was delicious! As some other reviewers have noted, it is not the same as other deep dish varieties.

Yes, it was slightly different than other Chicago pizzas. The crust was very bready, soft and somewhat spongy. Very pale and lightly cooked. Big thick edge, which added even more unwanted breadiness. The toppings were ample, and of decent quality. The cheese was hardly brown at all. Very little sauce. The whole thing was limp and soggy. Not a good experience.

($1.50 for extra toppings on a small pizza? Them toppings better be fresh..!)In my mind, I had tried a thin crust pizza from Pizza Hut, and I thought it was like crackers with tomato sauce.

The crust was flaky, but not too thin that you had to put napkins on your lap to prevent sauce from dripping.Would highly recommend this place for a late night grubbin'!",3,7,positive

As everyone knows, Chicago has a lot of options in the pizza department, but the crust at Pequod's is what makes this place unique and the pie incredibly tasty.

Nice beer selection -- although they were having some tap identity crisis while we were there and couldn't seem to get that straightened out. Nevertheless, our small group of three had a large deep dish and a mega salad and left with pizza to spare. STRONG RECOMMENDATION  -- eat the pizza there. Don't bother taking it home. It loses so much in microwave translation. Husband was 'eh' on his reheated slice and now I have to make a return trip (woe, is me) to show him the real deal.",2,3,positive

3537,"I have a split opinion on Pequod's. The pizza is a unique take on Chicago-style deep dish that's one of my favorites. The crust is unusually crisp for this style, and the caramelized edges give their pies a delicious, deep flavor that I love. Eating at this place can be a nightmare, though. First - if you have anywhere else you're thinking of going on a weekend, go there instead. The dining room is a shit show of bitchy 20-something staff and customers trying to edge their way into the bar for most of the evening on the weekends that's really not worth bothering with. If you're a grown up, do not go here on a weekend night. Also, they will tell you that they take reservations - do not believe it. This is basically a college pizza place, they do not have the ability to actually reserve a time, or if they do they will ignore you anyway for anyone who got their pager from the host desk before you. Again, for emphasis - DO NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY SAY THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS.TL;DR - Go for the pizza, but take it for carry out.",4,6,negative

Personally, I like more savory crusts.I recommend making reservations and/or placing your order while you're waiting.

Good enough that I wanted to come back and try it a month later. On my second trip, I was disappointed. Not by the pizza, for we never got a table. The wait was 60 minutes at 10:00 on a Saturday. What struck me is how much of a dive the place really is. Dingy, dirty, cramped and generally run down. Not what you'd expect from a popular place. The bathrooms are a disaster of ancient plumbing and water leaking on the floor. I hope it was only water. Pequod's is not kitschy or old school or hip, it's just tired, very tired. Even the bar looks forlorn and obviously neglected with cheap decorations and unstocked shelves. I'm sure the owners make a mint on the place. But they sure don't spend a dime making it nice, clean and modern. Fire trap comes to mind. But the pizza is still good. Just not good enough to endure the building and environs.",10,10,negative

I mean 80% BREAD and a sprinkle of toppings. Their famous caramelized crust is just soft, chewy burnt cheese. The crust was super soft and the sauce had no flavor. I was thoroughly disappointed.

That said, at that price it better taste like gold or at least something special.The first time we ordered it, it did.  This past time though it was fairly average, which more importantly means they aren't consistent. The crust was really super bready and didn't seem like it was done enough. Kind of like eating a bland loaf of bread. Two of my friends were actually turned off by it enough to not eat more than a piece. I ordered garlic as a topping and it was completely raw on the pizza as well. This is not pizza made of gold.  I do love the cheesy char they get on the edge, though some would just call this cheesy char burnt cheese.Ordering delivery from here couldn't be easier. While some places that are really busy show it, the order taker on the phone makes it seem effortless. It does take an hour and a half to get a pizza to your door when busy though.",15,5,negative
3558,"SO much bread. And I love bread, but this was beyond excessive. I should add that we got our deep dish to go, so maybe it would have been better at the restaurant. Pequods has good sauce but lou malnatis deep dish is way better. This was like 2 inches of foam consistency bread under an average amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings. :/",5,1,negative

The caramelized cheese on the crust and the perfectly executed marinara sauce make this the best damn pizza I have ever eaten. It's amazing.",7,1,positive
3561,"This review is for a recent delivery on a Friday night. The time quoted was 75 minutes, which is pretty standard for a Friday night delivery, so no worries there.. The pizza's arrived hot and fresh, so all good there. We got 2 large pizza's with 2 toppings on each.. the total was ~46$. I would give this joint a solid 3.5 but what kept me from giving a 4/5 is the following: 1. The qual is good but crust was a bit burnt and the toppings are way skimpy. We had one with ground beef and onion, the ground beef was barely noticeable.. The other was jalapeno and pineapple.. and same for this one, very skimpy, especially considering your paying ~3$ per topping for a large.. The only topping that was plentiful ( and actually excessive ), was the cheese... next time I will get light cheese!2. The price is a bit expensive for the overall quality and quantity. ( another place near me serves a x-large special daily for 13$ or ~18$ including tax and delivery charge. better qual, more toppings, larger pie, faster delivery.. )I will try this again and dine in sometime as well and post another review. As of now, its a fair deal that's worth checking out again...",12,5,negative

Their was also lots of other people up there eating as well. An hour and a half goes by and half of there staff gives us attitude, with dirty stares and talking under there breath.. And our waiter even spilled water on two people at our table. Minutes later four of there girl employees start talking crap to us, mind you they were drunk. Where's the manager?!!

3565,"Having recently moved to Lincoln Park, I wanted to go on a little walk around my neighborhood to check out some local spots which could have the potential to become my regular ones. Pequod's just might be the winner for my new pizza joint!This review is based only on carry-out because I didn't have enough time to dine-in.A Medium Deep Dish 1/2 Sausage and 1/2 Spinach and Mushroom was calling my name, so I called my order in at about 7:30pm for pick-up. The girl I spoke to was extremely friendly, and even knew my name even though I didn't tell her. I'm assuming she was either a secret agent spy, or had a pretty cool caller-ID on her phone, either way it made the experience a lot more personable.Around 7:50pm, I made my way over to pick up the pie. The hostess was really friendly too, and told us that I could pay and pick up at the bar. The place was pretty full for a week night, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. The pizza itself is delicious. I loved the crust, mushrooms, cheese, sausage, and spinach- all were fresh and tasty. Although, I didn't fall in love with the tomato sauce, I think I could look past it. The serving size was also very generous, and 1.5 slices were more than enough for me. Needless to say, I had plenty of leftovers for the next day.Overall, a great experience at Pequod's and would recommend it to anyone in the mood for some great pizza!",17,1,positive
3566,"I'm not from Chicago, but the city is known for deep dish.  So, even though Pequod's offers thin crust, I did not try it.  When in Rome??  But, I have been to 4 or 5 different pizza places in Chicago and hands down Pequods is the best deep dish.  They start by lining the edges of a cast iron pan with mozerella cheese. This creates a stupid good carmalized crust on the pizza.  The flavors are incredible.  We added italian sausage and it was the best sausage I've ever had on a pizza.  Quality sausage.  The place is packed, especially on weekend evenings, but if you have the time to wait, it is well worth it.  They also have a fantastically cheap lunch special for $4.95.  Includes a 7"" deep dish with one topping plus a beer or soda.  Can't beat that with a stick.",7,2,positive

It seems like a few people are like WTF to the caramelized crust, but come on people, it's like the char on a marshmallow over a campfire.  AMAZING.  The sausage is delicious and you can taste all the herbs and the sauce is pretty great also.  It's a little hard to cut, but what they hey?  I like a challenge.  We waited for less than 2 minutes, our server and the host were super friendly, and the prices were decent.  I'm intrigued by the $5 personal pizza and beer lunch special.  Who wants to skip work???Also- this whole whale tail thong thing makes my head spin... a thong on a whale on a thong, which will inevitably be a whale tail when you try to cram your pizza laden ass into your skinny jeans.  Crazy.",15,4,positive

3574,"I'm definitely a fan of this place.  I was originally taken aback when we thought we made a reservation by emailing the restaurant, only to find out upon arrival at the restaurant that the email request was just ""taken into consideration.""  Some people waited upwards of TWO WHOLE HOURS to be seated.  It's another 40 minutes for your pizza to come out!  Because we had emailed Pequod's and requested an 8 pm seating, we only had to wait an hour.  We were basically bumped up to the ""high priority"" list of parties to be seated.  Once seated, we didn't know who our server was.  We were at our table for a good ten minutes and no one stopped by so we just grabbed server who was walking by and placed our order.  We had plenty of time to sit outside and look over the menu, so we knew exactly what we wanted once we were in. We started with the breaded shrooms.  Meh, I've had better breaded mushrooms.  I thought they were going to come out like stuffed mushrooms.  They were more like deep fried mushrooms with a lot of batter.  I ended up pulling the actual mushroom out of the breading and eating it plain instead.  Then the pizza came out. I guess Pequod's pizza can't be technically considered deep dish, but rather pan pizza?  WHO CARES?  IT WAS AMAZING.  The sauce was great, the crust was nice and crispy, plenty of toppings.  On top of all that, our server accidentally put in a medium size order for us when we originally asked for small.  They apologized and only charged us for the small!  I wanted to apologize to the restaurant for not being able to finish our food!  We were leaving Chicago the next day, so we couldn't even take the pizza home.  So sad.I would definitely suggest this place to others.  But would add the caveat, if you want to be seated close to when you want to eat, make sure to email in advance a reservation request!  I don't know that I would wait two hours for Pequod's, much less any restaurant, but I would definitely do an hour wait.",7,2,positive
3575,"This place is so over rated.  Went there with my husband one night since hearing all the hype about how great their pizza is.  We went on a weekend so it was busy.  The place is much bigger than it looks.  We were seated upstairs.  Very dirty and grimey restaurant.  Bathrooms were even more disgusting.  We got their ""famous"" deep dish and although the carmelized cheese is delicious, the dough was thick and soggy and not that great.  Personally, I prefer Lou Malnati's deep dish or even JET'S crispy corner pizza over Pequods.",5,3,negative
3576,"Good pizza, slow, noisy, douche ownerWent to Pequod's for pizza last week.  To start, the pizza is good, 8.5 out of 10.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, I give them a 9.However it took 1:20 to get the pizza from the time we ordered it, and we pre-ordered it.  Way too long.  We were seated upstairs, where I wouldn't go again  even if I was told there was a pot of gold up there.  This is where the wait staff dumps dishes and silverware from cleared tables.  It's also where they like to seat groups.  Because of the background noise, the people at large tables can only hear each other when they yell at each other.  This only adds to the noise, with people at every table yelling and screaming at each other just to be heard.  It's awful, just awful. If you must go, avoid upstairs and especially the back room like the plague.The first sign that the 60 something owner is a kind of a douche is that he has a pony tail to the middle of his back.  Now, I don't really hold that against him, but it starts to paint a picture.  He likes pro hockey, and I appreciate that.  However, he insists that every TV be tuned to pro hockey.  The night we were there, 4-0 Northwestern was playing at home against 5-0 Ohio State, perhaps NW's biggest home game in 10 years.  He refused to turn just one of the seven tv's off hockey to the NW game.  And even after the first period of hockey was over and there was 18 minutes of intermission advertising, he refused to turn just one tv to football during the intermission.  Douche.  Now remember, each NHL team plays 82 regular season games each year.  He can't change one tv just once, even during intermission?There are a couple of other very good pizza places within two miles of Pequods.   Considering the wait after ordering, the unbearable noise, and an owner who could care less about customer service, I will not be eating at Pequod's again.  If you must have their pizza, order it to go.",10,7,negative
3577,"A friend who recently moved to Chicago had their deep dish, and was simply raving about it. So I was compelled to try it out myself. I made the mistake in trying to get a table on a Saturday night, so we passed on it. Over a month later, we came back when it was less busy, and wow, it was worth it! I ordered a medium to eat that night and take home a little leftover, with some AMAZING sausage and black olives. Having read on here just now that they take reservations, really helps next time I want to come back. It's a pretty small place, not at all conductive to waiting, but once you're in there, it's worth it!  If you're coming via transit, take the Red, Brown or Purple (express) to the Fullerton station, and then take the 74 Fullerton bus west, get off at Greenview, and walk south towards N Clybourn, the place will be on the left just across the street from Regal Cinemas and Barnes & Noble.And there's no A in the name.

It's a divey dark, kinda small but with a second floor kind of bar setting place. The waitstaff adorn shirts of the mascot which is a whale with a pair of panties on it's head. I couldn't figure out what the joke was there, but ah well. Everyone was friendly enough. Aaron and I decided to order up a deep dish pepperoni pizza and the fried appetizer platter. The timing was good because the appetizer came out fairly quickly. Everything on it was good, the stand out though, were the Jalapeno poppers. They had cheddar cheese in the middle rather than the more standard cream cheese. It was a really nice and tasty touch. The pizza was also fantastic. I loved the touch of the burnt parm cheese cooked on top of the crust. It was also a very balanced za just the right amount of sauce and cheese on it. The dough had almost an olive oil taste to it, and I swear that the sauce had a touch of red wine in it. The pep[eroni was nice and crisp and thin sliced with a hint of spice in it. All in all it was a great dinner. I keep telling Aaron that we need to make a return trip because that za was crave worthy.",18,2,positive

The ingredients are fresh and flavorful and the crust, as you may have heard, is caramalized cheesy goodness. We got the sausage, onions, and bell peppers (for me and the others who know how to eat pizza) and the veggie (for those who dont understand pizza). That is the only way to get pizza - sausage, onions, bell pepers, and maybe garlic. Other ingredients are just wrong. The only slight criticism I have is that the pizza is a bit doughy, even for deep dish.  But the sauce, over abundance of cheese, and the fresh ingredients make up for it.",7,3,positive

3601,"Many of us can probably agree that drinking quite a few alcoholic beverages prior to eating can make mediocre food taste like victuals from a feast of Hedone. However, an odd occurrence took place when I ate at Pequod's. Even with more than 4 glasses of wines swishing around inside of me, I did not find Pequod's version of deep dish pizza worthy of my palate. All you lovers of this faux deep dish can get mad if you want. I don't like it. I don't like the thin flavorless sauce, the way the toppings seem to be lackadaisically thrown into a heap atop of it all (Ingredients are supposed to be inside of a deep dish. In.... Side.), or the cheese. The crust; let's talk about it. At first, when I shared my underwhelment (I made it up) of this pizza, I was told I should have had the caramelized crust. Upon checking with my friend who brought me here, I learned that I, indeed, had had the caramelized crust. Caramelized, seared, lightly whipped.... whatever the crust has to be in order to taste good, it is not. If a pizza tastes like this to me after that much wine, and while seriously hungry, I'd hate to consume it while sober. This is a transplant's deep dish, in my opinion. And when I really think about, that is mainly what has recommended this pizza to me; transplants. I ought to know better.",8,2,negative

I ordered their medium sized deep dish before and it was huge! I only finished 2 slices and I was full. It took me like 2 days to finish it. This is coming from someone who has a ridiculous appetite and can probably compete in those food contest. Check this place out if you love pizza.

Deep dish perfected: caramelized crust and tangy sauce, fresh toppings and cooked to perfection (in my book, the cheese should just start to be browning, the crust should be crusty on the outside and cooked through in the middle (not soggy/doughy/undercooked). The service was attentive and pleasant (when I dined in) and pickup was a snap (also a friendly/pleasant experience).  The decor is a blend of pizzeria, tavern, something, but I barely remember it -- I just remember getting a gorgeous pizza pie delivered to our table and loving every bite of it.Pequod's nails it. I love their pizza. I do. I'll be going back soon.P.S.: Dining in is definitely better than pick-up, but I'd say the same for all pizza.

I've worked in this industry for many years, I've hosted, I've run food, I've served, I've managed. I understand the other side of dining out and this was just a total let down. The wait, long. I understand that. I recommend this place to my boyfriends father who was excited to try deep dish which Chicagoans don't actually eat, but I always made an exception for Pequods. I used to love this place. 2.5 hrs later and multiple times of them telling our party ""10 more minutes"" I was absolutely finished and over this place. 1 six top, 2 four tops and 1 three top got seated before our party of 3; all of which arrived AFTER us and it's incredible that the hosts were not phased by this. ""Maybe they called ahead"", really? Yeah. Maybe they all called ahead and decided to show up 2 hours before the quote time just to hang out. F*cking doubtful. Maybe if I hadn't worked in this industry so long I'd believe you, nice try. But I don't buy it babe. Is the pizza good, yes. Would I ever go through this again? F*CK NO. Screw this place.",12,2,negative
3615,"The best, repeat, THE BEST DEEP DISH IN CHICAGO.We will get to the pizza in a moment, but first, everything else...Great local beer selection, great menu (outside of the pizza), fun atmosphere and a very nice staff.The pizza...life changing. For me, anytime you can say that the last bite you have of a meal is the best, well, you have yourself a good meal. It says something of a place when each bite gets better and better.Eat your meat loaded pizzas with a knife and fork, then save the crust and a tiny bit of sauce that escapes from your pie for dipping. The crust is the...freaking...best. The restaurant has been using the same deep dish pans since the dawn of man and all of those little garlic, cheese, oil and meat juices from the pans are seared right into the crust for the climax. I find it amazing that I can say that the best part of this pizza is the crust. Everything else is great...the cheese, the meats, the sauces...but the crust. Wow.If you are visiting Chicago and want some authentic deep dish, this is the spot where the locals go. And, it's never as insanely busy as the other touristy places that serve deep dish. It's very casual and feels like a neighborhood joint, which it totally is.",16,2,positive

Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders, to the servers are just rude and exhibit very little interest in the people that are spending their hard earned money to eat at this establishment. I really hope that they can get it together on the service side of things because the pizza is that good.

They told us they were making it now and it would be the next order out. an hour and a half later, the pizza came and as you can probably imagine, it was cold.

There are two things I'd like to highlight about this place.  The crust and the speed of the pizza coming out to the table.

I would definitely come back to enjoy again!",8,0,positive

3634,"Third time's a charm.After trying and being disappointed with two of Chicago's most famous pizza establishments -- Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- I was beginning to think that a ""to-die-for Chicago-style deep-dish pizza"" was on the same level as the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny and Santa Claus...myth. Pequod's changed all that.Upon arriving we placed our names on the wait list, grabbed a menu and took a seat at one of the four benches outside of the restaurant. We decided on the large (14"") pan pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. After about 20 minutes our party was called, we were taken through the first floor of the restaurant, up the stairs and into the massive second level. Once seated we were given menus for a second time to see if we wanted to add appetizers, salads, etc. We decided on the Pequod Salad for our party of four with their homemade Italian dressing.The Pequod Salad came out a few minutes later -- Romaine lettuce with mozzarella cheese, peperoni, pepperoncini, black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, carrots, tomato and onion. Definitely a good choice. It was the perfect size for us to split. They didn't skimp on the toppings. And, the homemade Italian dressing as suggested by our server was delicious.As good as it was, you don't go to a place like Pequod's for the salad. A few minutes our pizza arrived -- 154 square inches (yes, I used an online calculator) of piping-hot pizza goodness. To save us from burning ourselves and making a mess of of the pizza, the server plated the first half of the pizza for us, using the square spatula to pick up the pizza and cut off the strings of melted cheese crawling from the pan onto our plates.Now the toppings on the pizza were, for the most part, comparable to both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- loads of pepperoni, thinly sliced mushrooms crisped by the oven, thick homemade tomato sauce and bubbling cheese. The difference, however, was found in the crust. At Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, the crust was too bready and even soggy because of all the sauce. But crust at Pequod's was heaven. They call it their ""famous caramelized crust"", an apt description. The crust was the perfect balance of buttery, chewy, crunchy, crispy, slightly-burned goodness. And at the edges, the cheese had melted to the side of the crust/pan to form a ""halo"" (their word, not mine) of caramelized cheesy/crusty deliciousness.In the end, that crust and that ""halo"" single-handedly saved Chicago's reputation for having a ""to-die-for deep-dish pizza."" For that all Chicago natives should be thankful. And, they should show their thankfulness by going to Pequod's. That's where we'll be next time we visit the Windy City.",12,3,positive
3635,"My experiences at Pequod's have continued to be great. I've brought a few friends here who otherwise are not deep dish fans and made them believers. Pequod's is in a league of their own when it comes to deep dish. The carmelized crust sets them apart...more of a ""crunchy"" than a ""so much cheese I'm going to die"" experience when you dine here. I love bringing friends to Pequod's and blowing their minds. I have tried the thin crust and don't think it's anything super special, but I am willing to endure a 45 minute train ride + 15-20 minute walk completely out of my way for this deep dish and I think that says a lot. On the odd occasion when I do drive, parking can be a hassle. But it's worth it for this place.",6,2,positive
3636,"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant. The customer service was terrible. I ordered delivery and had to repeat myself and spell everything out, which I was fine with to assure I got my food even though my address was not very difficult. I initially told my address the first time to see if we were located within the delivery zone. I waited the 1.5 hours that was quoted and still had not received it so I called. They had me repeat my address again multiple times and said it was out for delivery and would be here in 5-10 minutes... the time went  by and it still hadn't arrived... My boy friend called again and they said they had no record of the order.. then when asked to speak to a manager continuously put him on hold and did not put a manager on. Finally a manager came on again asking for the address and then said that the phone number and address were both wrong and that is why we didn't get our pizza. The manager did not even apologize. I would not recommend this place. The next battle will be getting my money back.",3,4,negative
3637,"Wow.  Just wow.Seriously, that's all I could think of as I was eating the beautiful creation in front of us.  The pizza is just... awesomeness.  I've had good deep dish and one of my favorite restaurant in LA has a great deep dish, so I had really high expectations going in to Pequod's.We were able to make a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday night and right when you get in, you can tell Pequod's the sort of neighborhood spot where on weekdays locals will come and watch them game while grabbing a bite and drinks.  The whole feel of the place is that even though Pequod's can be filled with tourists (like me), it is still a local spot, which I like.After a long hard look, decided to go with the deep dish with sausage, pepperoni, spinach, mushroom, garlic, and fresh basil.  First of all, that caramelized cheese crust, which gives the edges of the pizza a darkened crust, is just fantastic.  That crunchy crust is straight up addicting.  Forget all the stuffed crust and the whatever-crust-Pizza-Hut is coming out with now.  The cast iron pan is super well-seasoned, which differentiate the thick crust from being just bread.  As for the toppings, it's all to everyone's own personal choice but we loved the sausages.  Great huge chunks of sausage that goes so well with the delicious sauces and cheese.  We liked how there was lots of sauce, and you even have the option of going extra on the sauces!  The pepperoni was good and there's lots of it underneath all the cheese.  Definitely try to add some veggies though cause, especially spinach cause it fits perfectly.  Also helps to serve to refresh your palate mid-bite :P The pizza did take awhile, so we decided to get an order of onion rings.  Just your typical onion rings, served with BBQ sauce.They also have a pretty good selection of beers on draft.  Decided to go with a local brew and the Goose Island 312 is a nice beer with the pizza since it has a nice citrus note.  Good change.The pizza did take awhile but trust, definitely worth the wait.  Is it the best deep dish?  It may just be.  All I can say that by completely stuffing myself after 2 and a half slices of the large and 2 beers, I still want more.  In fact, I was feeling sad knowing that as soon as I leave Chi-Town, I wouldn't be able to have it anymore.  Sigh.Do they ship?",24,4,positive

No pizza, the server didn't come once to refill our drinks. We decided to leave, we had to be at work in 5 mins and it took us 20 minutes to get there because of traffic. So my advice is if you don't have more than an hour to waste then don't go here apparently it takes the same time to prepare a 7' pizza than it does a 12' deep dish.Pizza is great don't get me wrong it among my favorites, this review is for the service we received.",3,2,negative

Oh by the way, Lou Malnati's is too generic, especially that I saw that it's all over Chicago.  I am a huge supporter of the small stores that make a huge impression on their food and attitude because that's what you need to survive in the food industry.  Give this place a shot, you will not regret it.  My husband and I surely don't.  We know pizza, we are from NYC----land of Italian restuarant...need I say more.",10,3,positive

Now I am not a big lover of deep dish pizza, and have not had it in years. The pizza was good, nothing I would write home about and go out of my way to visit all the time. There was too much sauce for my taste, the cheese was okay and the crust was overcooked. You need a steak knife to cut through this thing properly.

3668,"For the pizza, I'd give a hesitant 3, for everything else, I'm livid.I booked a table in advance knowing that it'd be packed and we had reservations to get to afterwards.  I did not realize that booking a table just reduces your wait time.  Pequod's PLEASE make it clearer on your reservation page that this isn't a ""reservation"" so much as a ""wait time reduction.""We took seats at the bar so we could avoid the wait time we didn't expect.  We were told the pizza would take about 45 minutes to an hour to come out.  An hour and 40 minutes later we were scarfing it down to be able to get to our show on time.  Absolutely no one was keeping us updated as to what the hell happened to our food.  We even pre-paid just to be able to walk out a tiny bit faster.To boot, we were told a small plus a medium would be ""just right"" for 4 people.  For real?  We ended up handing half of the pie to some lucky guy on the street just so we didn't feel it was totally wasted.I wanted to love this and really could not have been more heartbroken.",4,2,negative
3669,"I'm really not a big fan of Piece Pizza, but I went with a few friends and was told it would be hour and half wait.  WTF?  I know it's Saturday night, but It's not worth that kind of a wait.  Instead, we went to Pequod's because none of us had been there.  We arrive only to have to a 15 minute wait, which is much better.  We got deep dish pizza, which didn't take long to make.  The pizza was really good.  However, we all thought ""it could use some extra cheese.""  I told another friend the next day and she asked if we had extra cheese because they apparently don't put enough on it.  Ahhh, that would have been helpful.  Remember, ask for extra cheese!  It's worth it.  I can eat...alot.  I could only eat two slices of their deep dish.   Base your ordering on a 2 slices per person rule and you'll have plenty. I found the restaurant to be quaint and comfortable.  The service quick and friendly.  Worth going again.  I forgot to mention... In the time it took us to drive there, order, eat and pay, we would still be waiting for Piece Pizza to actually get around to seating us.  Which would you rather do?  Wait or eat?",9,0,positive

3671,"I've always like Pequod's.  It tastes like adult pizza to me - darker flavors and not all sweet.  The carmelized crust is yummy.  The lunch special is a great deal, but they won't cook your pre-order anymore.  Not sure why - if people not showing up for their orders is a problem they could just ask for pre-payment and I'd be happy too since you have to wait 25 minutes otherwise (they should tell you that).",5,1,positive
3672,I wanted a deep dish slice but wasn't hungry enough to eat a whole pizza so i ordered their lunch special.  It looked like a deep dish but was all dough.  I was disappointed but  it did taste really good.  Then i looked at the deep dish pizza at the table next to me and hungered for more.  Don't order the special go strait for the dish.,3,1,negative
3673,"(the other location gets 5 stars, but this one sometimes is swingy in quality)This review isn't about the great pizza, or who it challenges for what sort of pizza challenge in the city. This is specific to one thing: lunch.Holy cow is the special efficient!If you're the type to imbibe, you might actually be stealing from them. Well, if you can drink just the one you get with the special. (Alcoholism - it's how they get ya)Yes, yes, it's lunch so we don't imbibe. Soda's also free, Coke products. Warning - no free refills in the special. (Sugarholism - it's how they get ya)The deal's a drink and a personal pan with one topping. Extra toppings cost a little bit more. I usually got sausage, onions, jalapenos because I'm a weirdo and it made the afternoon meetings shorter. It does take a little while if you don't call ahead - you're looking at a 45 minute lunch at least. (so, maybe call ahead, slacker)",4,1,positive
3674,"Hmm, I liked it but didn't love it! After reading all the great reviews I was prepared to put this pie on my list of Chicago faves...but not so much.We were quickly seated in the middle of the room. The place is cute enough, just like a neighborhood bar that serves pizza. The beer selection is decent, and the service was prompt and friendly.The pizza came out relatively quickly, considering we got the pan pizza. Now I can appreciate the caramelized (burnt-ish) crust, but I just didn't love it, like I say. I really didn't care for the sauce all that much either. I typically prefer a more fresh, tomatoey sauce (like Lou Malnati's) rather than this sauce which seemed overcooked and tomato paste-y....just not my preference.Anyway, we ordered way too big of a pie, and server put in a styrofoam clamshell thingy to go (a bag would have been nice...maybe I should have asked for one and they could have set me up, but I didn't). The thing was cumbersome to carry around as we walked back to the El...so much so that we were sick of carrying it, so we left it on top of the Red Eye box outside the Apple store (if anyone wants to see if it's still there, there's 3 large slices left...).Perhaps I would go back if I was in the area and had a hankerin' for pizza, but I don't see myself making a special trip.",16,2,negative

3677,"Solid. I had Pequod's for the first time several days ago after hours of basketball. My exhaustion and hunger must have added to the flavor of the pizza. There are not too many places where I enjoy their thin crust pizza. My buddies and I ordered the large thin crust with spinach and sausage. The sauce was thick, but tasty (where have i heard that before? kidding, kidding). My buddy didn't think it was tomato-y enough, but I thought it was pretty good. The only gripe I have about the pizza was that the spinach did not mix well in there. It made my mouth feel weird from the texture of the spinach, so I would recommend not getting the spinach in the thin crust. We also ordered some chicken wings. It was not that great. I can cook some better wings off my foreman grill to be honest. Which is why I had to knock down the rating here! Come for the pizza, but don't stay for the wings!",9,3,negative
3678,"Stop reading this review and order this pizza right now! I seriously crave and miss this pizza every day. The lunch special is amazing! You get a personal size pizza with one topping and a drink for $4.95 (or at least what I remembered)!! If they could deliver this to Ohio, I would order it weekly by the pallet. The burnt caramelized crust makes the dough so sweet and savory.. Now my mouth is watering thinking about it. What I love most about this place is that it's not a chain and it's one of a kinda.

3683,"Wow.  Can't really compare this place to other Chicago spots because this was the only one I tried (other than Lou Malnati's at the Taste), but it was ... transcendent.  Or maybe that was just my brain misfiring due to the oxygen deficiency that occurred once the artery cheese chokehold commenced.  So good. This was one of those meals where you go beyond full, when you keep saying ""just one more bite"" until it is gone, and your stomach likes the abuse, secretly enjoys being pushed to maximum capacity.Staff was cool, beers were cold, ambiance was appropriately pizza parlor.  Worth the hike out from downtown for sure.   One of the better pizzas I've ever had.",5,3,positive

3696,"I've had Pequod's bookmarked for months and months.  I've previously been over to the nearby theater and had thought fleetingly about going to Pequod's for a bite afterward but never had.  I'd even once stopped by to attempt to get slices but was thwarted by a closed sign on the door.  So I'd always just missed on a Pequod's visit.  Now, that's all changed, as I've finally made it past that dirty blue marquee into the highly vaunted promised land.My one and only visit to Pequod's actually happened on a whim after the initial plan of the evening, a visit to Wilde, was abortive due to zero parking available in Lakeview.  Since we're both trying to do something right as good little Catholics by not eating meat on Fridays during Lent, the backup plan in my hip pocket of cheese pizza at Pequod's came into play.We passed under the ugly blue marquee and entered a packed pizzeria on a Friday night.  We were quoted ten minutes, so we took a seat at the bar and enjoyed a pint.  Not two minutes later, our name was called and off we went.  I figured we were getting the table next to the bar that was just vacated.  Wrong.  We were led upstairs, past the first room and way back to the room for the little kiddies all the way back in the corner.  Who knew the place was so huge?  I really didn't care for where we were seated, but, again, food is paramount.We ordered a large pan pizza (cheese only, yawn), mozzarella sticks and a bowl of tomato bisque.  The soup was only okay.  It was too thick and cheesy.  The mozzarella sticks were mozzarella sticks.  We had to get something for an appetizer though, as I'd already made poor little starving K-Mac wait long enough.  We only ended up eating one slice of the pizza apiece.  As far as the pizza goes (that's all that really matters), it was pretty decent.  I'd put it on a par with places like Lou's and Gino's, quite honestly.  I'm more of a thin crust guy than a deep dish guy.  The carmelized crust is quite lovely.  But it all just tends to blow up in my stomach.  Also, it's remarkable that a Pequod's pan pizza is at its best in the restaurant and hot.  I took home four huge slices and made my way through them in about 48 hours' time.  This pizza does not translate in a cold iteration.  It actually doesn't translate in a reheated iteration very well either.  And the air in the dough again just blows up in my stomach.  My thin crust Aurelio's will always be my top lover as far as pizza goes.Pequod's is three stars.  It's alright.  But it's not great.",18,6,negative

3698,"How do I even begin to review the most amazing pizza place in all the land? Probably with the crust. The cheesy, burnt, delicious crust that may not look appealing to the eyes will certainly appeal to your tastebuds. While not a traditional Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza (it's a pan pizza) the the thick, crumbly crust and massive amounts of cheese will leave you just as satisfied. A medium pizza easily serves 3-4 people, at around $20, is a great value in addition to being absolutely delicious! Aside from the crust, the rest of the pizza is exactly what you would expect.  It has a good crust:sauce:cheese ratio and offers all your normal toppings. Personally, I recommend pepperoni and jalepeno. I order Pequods every time a new person comes to visit, and no one has ever been disappointed. Just don't wait until your actually starving to order since it will take at least 45 min for dine-in and has a pretty consistent 90 min delivery time.",11,2,positive
3699,I am an avid pizza lover and I must admit I was a little disappointed.  The dough to sauce ratio was too high.  I felt like i was eating all cheese and dough.  Maybe its because i ordered take out.  I will give it another try and eat in house.,3,1,negative

3701,"Okay, let's just go ahead and put this out there. The best part about pizza is eating the leftovers the next day. Especially deep dish, because its had time to settle and become somewhat manageable with just my hands, which is another important part of my pizza eating.I have to admit, Pequods is my favorite deep dish in the city when I have time to go there and sit down to eat it fresh! The sauce is delicious, and everything just tastes like its had a little more care put into it than some of those over-touristy locations downtown. However, they tend to have a much thicker crust on the bottom than most places, and I just dont like Pequods as much the next day. It ends up tasting too much like a loaf of bread, with a bit of sauce and cheese on top. If I'm going to put in double time at the gym just to enjoy a slice or two, then I want toppings! Lots of sauce and cheese! I mean...if you're going to indulge, we may as well go all out, and bread just doesnt do it for me.They were quick to deliver  for deep dish(45 min) but I prefer dining in. Also, something about all of the salads I have tasted has been a little off. Maybe its the fat-free italian that I dont care for. Who needs salad when you have pizza, though?Definitely give it a try though, maybe its just me and my weird feelings on deep dish.",13,3,negative

3706,"Pequod's is for people who like bread. We ordered a large topping pizza. They were VERY generous with the toppings. I really liked that about the pizza. The carmalization ROCKED. Pequod has really made themselves a signature with that. Seriously, it's worth a try. However, I have yet to find a pizza place on the north side (and I'm a northsider) that is better than the southside and that sucks because my husband is a southsider and BRAGS about the pizza quality of the south side. The crust is a deal breaker for me. This crust was more breadlike with no flavor. If I were asked to improve the crust, I would make it a garlic butter crust. It was too much bread for us at the bottom of the pizza and not enough flavor. So, if you're a fan of a ""breadlike"" crust, then this is the place for you. We are not bread crust fans. By ""bread"", I mean that the consistency seemed like the pizza ingredients were sitting on top of a piece of bread. I wanted to LOVE this place, but it's just not for us.",10,1,negative
3707,"BEWARE!!! They use the term ""Deep Dish"" but it is in fact only a Pan Pizza. Deep Dish is an entirely different pizza and what we thought we were buying. We asked if it was Deep Dish and not just Pan Pizza and were given the affirmative that it was Deep Dish. OK, so disappointment aside, how does it rate? Crust too thick and dry. Minimal cheese put on top of that and then the sauce. It needs the sauce on the crust to help it out. Ingredients on top of sauce. Sauce was good. Not going to recommend this though because we've had much better Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut!",6,1,negative

Pizza's still good, but I can find this ambience at...oh, I don't know...Olive Garden, or Domino's. And I can find good pizza at any number of places as well (Lou Malnati's comes to mind.)  Pequod's does not produce such a singular product that I cannot consider other options, and what made them unique is now gone, by their choice.

When we arrived at 7:00p the placed was crowded (as predicted) but we breezed by those who didn't have the foresight to make a reservation and were immediately seated on the second floor. We ordered two pizzas - a sausage, bell pepper, and mushroom, and a pepperoni, and bell pepper. The sausage and bell pepper was a hit, and the pepperoni was a distant second. The fried appetizer plate was decent, but not a must-have. Like always, we ordered pitchers of Half-Acre. Despite the massive number of customers on the second floor, our waitress was awesome and was always around to refill our pitchers or to meet other needs. Per usual - dining at Pequods was an excellent experience.",6,3,positive

3713,"Not that this place needs another review - I still thought I'd add my 2 cents.  Disclaimer: Even though I'm a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I don't eat deep dish or pan pizza.  If I wanted that, I'd get a calzone.  I'm strictly a thin crust girl.  So this review is only for their thin crust.Pequod's is in the top 3 places in the Chicago area for pizza.  (#1 pizza ever is Papa Del's in Champaign).  Their sauce is a little thick, but other than that, the overall package of crust, sauce and toppings is near perfection.  The crust even acts as a little handle for eating!When going, make sure to have a reservation or be prepared to wait.  And put your order in when you check in. I will say the bar staff is less than friendly, and the waiters all seem mostly overwhelmed (but do their best to keep it together), but the place isn't packed every night for the service.Must try for anyone coming to Chicago!",4,1,positive
3714,Good Pizza. Impressive house salad.The pizza is much doughy-er than Lou's which I was not a huge fan of. I prefer more sauce. I would go back and try the original location in Morton Grove-- I heard they changed the recipe for the city in order to deal with the heavy traffic.,1,0,negative
3715,"You would be really hard-pressed to find better Chicago-style deep dish pizza in the city. There are the classics, like Lou's and Giordano's, but I believe you lose a little something when you start opening up your restaurant in multiples. Pequod's is still unique, and it's in high demand--I recommend putting your name in, and then going next door to the Drinkingbird while you wait, which could be easily be and hour or more. It's close enough so that your buzzer will still go off when your table is ready. Also, avoid going during Blackhawks games or Bulls games--people tend to sit at their tables and extend the wait time even longer than it is already!

What's this pan thing?Pequods is the one deep dish that argues its case well enough with me.  I want everything to arrive in my life in a seasoned iron pan when I eat here.Yeah this location is chaotic, but I always wind up here, and the pizza has always outshone whatever dysfunction was going on with the service.  I'm pretty mellow.  What sells me is how I can chow down on this obviously insane pile of calories and yet never feel rock-in-stomach heavy or gross afterward. That's impressive.The ""Chicago Style"" I bother with consistently, and I've had all the major players.",6,4,positive

Its not an everyday sort of pizza though, its 2 times a day kind of pizza!  The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars:I have this thing about perfect ratios in my pizza - sauce to ingredients to cheese to crust.  (its the same thing with hot dogs)  Pequods is perfect on everything, except for crust.  I am not talking about the caramelized goodness on the outside of the pie, I am talking about the bottom of the pie.  Especially when eaten the 2nd day, the crust is thicker and I have to eat only the top layer of it.  Still, get the largest size, because it is fantastic for leftovers (if you aint thick crust phobic like me) and don't bother with any starters to save room for the real deal.",7,2,positive
3718,By far my favorite Pizzeria in Chicago. The ratio of all ingredients is just perfect and the crunch of the cheese and softness of the dough is amazing.

Their sausage is among the best I've ever tasted on a pizza and the carmelized crust is good enough to convert any of you non-crust-eaters out there. I would say that their pizzas taste better if you don't over do it on the ingredients, so don't go overboard on your toppings.

Right from the two hostes the rudeness began.  I don't get what there problem was but they were pretty pissed I said we would wait for a booth.  They really made sure we felt u comfortable about that.  Then when we did get seated our waitress was just as mad and rude to us as well.  She must of asked the table next to us if they were ok four times and we did not get asked once.  Our drinks and food were slammed down on our table as if she had a personal problem with us.  It was extremely uncomfortable.  The pizza and wings of course were delicious but the service really killed it.  I can honestly say I don't think I would ever go back to this location.  I have not felt uncomfortable like this in a restaurant in a long time.,6,5,negative
3722,"Don't believe the hype. I was bamboozled by the good reviews for this place. I ordered a medium deep dish cheese yesterday which cost a little over $18 with delivery. The crust was VERY  thick and doughy, with too much sauce. I was amazed especially by how little cheese there was on the pizza- I mean veerry little. I've never really been a fan of deep dish pizza because it is too much cheese, but this pizza I don't even think you can classify as deep dish at all. Save your money.",2,1,negative
3723,"Don't let Pequod's fly under your deep dish pizza radar!  I love pizza.  I love deep dish pizza, and Pequod's is exceptional.  The crust- the edges are super crispy and kind of carmelized but the bottom is thick and doughy.  The sauce- Pequod's does not skimp on the sauce which I love, and the cheese is gooey and perfectly portioned to the amount of sauce on the pie.  I've eaten in and also had pizzas delivered.  Either way, it is great!  The service is wonderful, and the pizza is truly fantastic.",9,0,positive
3724,"My dining experience in Chicago finished off with a deep dish pizza dinner and I was not disappointed at all with choosing Pequod's to end it all.  It was packed because of the Pats vs. Tebow game, but luckily we had a reservation and were seated upstairs.  We had the corner booth to watch the game so I could not have been happier with our seating.  The pizza took a long time to come out, but they warn you of that when you walk in.  They make each pizza to order, which to me is a great thing.  In the end, there is lot worse things that you can do then to talk to company for 30 minutes while you salivate at the thought of some cheesy, doughy, saucy concoction cooking in the oven waiting your disposal.  To be 100% honest, I still prefer NYC pizza, but Chicago pizza was delicious and filling.  2 pies were more than enough for 5 of us (3 guys, 2 girls) and they were both extremely delicious.  Side note: The next morning I went skeet shooting (that's right bitches, I am a skeet shooter too) with a Chicago native and he was very pleased at my choice of Pequod's for the deep dish pizza, so clearly it's a favorite amongst locals as well.",12,3,positive

3727,"My fiance has been on a deep dish kick lately and whenever Friday rolls around he can't help but crave anything else besides this place. We have both been born and bred on Chicago's Deep Dish pizza and have tried them all. I've got to say the pepperoni deep dish here is awesome and is a fierce competitor. Notwithstanding the great pizza, be prepared to WAIT & WAIT & WAIT, especially on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and/or any major basketball & hockey game. This place gets filled to the brim quickly. And while the hosts try to guesstimate as best they can what the wait will actually be they are usually off by a half hour. Either way, once you do get into this place, prepare to stuff yourself.  :)",3,1,positive
3728,"Similar to Lou Malanati's in thickness (quite thick) and cheesiness (same amount as a typical thin crust pizza), Pequod's deep dish is one of Chicago's best. The burnt, cheesy ring around the top is absolutely delicious. High quality ingredients. Great classic feeling wood-paneled interior if you eat in, but no issues with delivery. Becoming one of the most popular ""non-touristy"" deep dish joints in Chicago. And rightfully so. Highly recommend!",7,1,positive

3730,"After eating at The Art of Pizza and hating their deep dish, I was VERY skeptical. I wondered why people from Chicago subject themselves to these doughy monstrosities they call ""pizza."" Didn't they know that better exists? Oh but they do and its called Pequods. And it is AMAZING! It is light and crunchy and the caramelized crust is heaven. I ordered a small thin crust for myself because I was so afraid of the deep dish. But alas all I did was eat deep dish because it was like a drug. Eat here, love it. Tip: it takes about 40 mins to make the pizza, but you can call ahead for dine in or take out.",4,3,positive
3731,"There is a constant argument that Chicagoans participate in regarding where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city. Pequod's, hands down, has my vote in this battle.

3732,"There's little to add, but I'll just note that this place was founded by Burt Katz, who went on to found Burt's Place up in Morton Grove. If you're not fond of ""traditional"" Chicago style deep dish (I'm not) try this place anyway - the Pequod's/Burt's style is a fantastic, unique twist on Chicago deep dish. Most importantly, this location has pizza that is nearly identical to what you'll find at Burt's - the defining characteristics are the caramelized crust, a thick, cake-like crust, and comparatively thin layer of cheese.The procedure for eating here is not nearly as challenging as it is at Burt's. I've been to this location a number of times and have never had to wait for a table. Also, try the garlic bread. It's incredible.",3,2,positive

They have a great selection of quality beers on tap also, as well as, some tasty apps. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

3740,"After a late show at Lincoln Hall we had a pizza craving. We whipped out the trusty Urban Spoon & wound up at Peaquod's. This place is awesome & uses their well seasoned cast iron pie pans for your pizza. We had just a basic sausage pan & it was just perfect. The center wasn't soggy at all, the crust had great flavor & stayed moist without becoming gummy & the cheese caramelized nice and crispy around the edges of the pan. Being a weeknight around 1am, it was nice & quiet & we had the waitress pretty much all to ourselves. Will def come back/carry out in the future.",10,1,positive
3741,"Pequod's brings back those good ole memories when I used to live in Bucktown and used to order on a late night to fulfill my pizza craving and/or after a late night of drinking. For those who need a break from the typical Chicago style deep dish, try Pequod's.  I had this with a friend and she didn't eat the crust and I was like, ""Wth you doing, don't be ridiculous and eat your crust!"" She thought it was burnt and that it was just another piece of crust like all generic pizza crusts. Their caramelized crust is to die for alone, although I'm pretty sure it's not good for your health haha ;( (oh well YOLO) The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and the sauce has a nice tangy taste that isn't overbearing. I usually get jalapenos, pe=pperoni and mushrooms on mine to keep it simple. The jalapenos gives it a nice kick to complement the tanginess of the sauce. There's always a line running down towards Webster so just a heads up for y'all who have special plans afterwards. If you live in the area, delivery is your best bet to avoid long lines or if you're feeling lazy on a Sunday afternoon.",11,3,positive
3742,"Mmmmm Pequod's. My favorite Chicago-style pizza yet.The caramelized crust is truly a thing to behold. And I love that the pizza is brought out in a cast iron skillet. It was surprising the first time I went there. The environment isn't too great - very much like a sports bar, with multiple TVs showing multiple sports games - but some people are probably way into that. The waitresses all wear the same (weird) uniform, consisting of shorty-shorts and weird hats (I think?), but that didn't really bother me, although my sister-in-law didn't care for it. But the Pequod's salad was great and perfect to split between four people. We got one 14"" pizza and had two pieces left over to eat later. Delicious as always.And personally, I'm a fan of this place not only for their good food, but also because it isn't full of tourists, which create ridiculous waits.",7,5,positive
3743,"5 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the service.  This is probably my favorite pizza in Chicago- I love their sauce and the crust is crispy.  I've ordered it for delivery and dined in, and while the atomosphere is fun delivery is much more reliable if you have a time constraint.  Went here on a Friday night with a reservation but still needed to wait for a table (which is fine, but some indication of how long we'd wait/an apology would have been nice), and our pizza took about an hour an 10 minutes when we were told it would be 40. I understand that it was a busy night, but our server avoided contact with us during that time without any explanation.  I think there may have been some mix-up, which again is fine, but don't ignore us.  Definitely plan on around 2 hours for dinner if you're eating there. It wasn't ideal, but the upstairs part is great and the pizza is worth it.",10,1,positive

3754,"Growing up as one of 5 children, my parents taught us never to waste food. Anything that was burnt was to be eaten anyway. Probably because it was your fault you didn't pay attention to it.

I love burnt cheese even morePequod's, thank you for drawing inspiration from my messed up childhood.This is one of the best deep-dish pizzas in Chicago. Actually, in the Deep Dish Pizza Tasting I did with my friends, Pequod's won.The carmelized crust is so delicious it should be criminal. Crispy crust with burnt cheese. Oh, man... It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.You MUST order the sausage pizza. I'm not usually a sausage kind of gal (The kind made from pork! Get your minds out of the gutter!), but Pequod's has converted me with their pepper-y, flavorful, the-other-white-meat goodness. We also ordered a pepperoni and green pepper pizza (a.k.a. the best pizza topping combination of all time). It was the perfect meat-to-veggie ratio, and the peppers me feel like I was being healthy despite the 1,000,000 grams of carbs I inhaled without a second thought.2 pieces will be plenty per person, but leftovers are encouraged because you will not be able to stop thinking about it by lunch the next day and will want more.

3757,"YUMTASTIC!! Have always ordered deep dish, they smother the pizza with the toppings of your choice and it is just heaven in your mouth.

I think I need a slice now!!",2,1,positive
3758,"Rather than cast another vote into the ""which deep dish is better?"" debate, I'll focus here on our experience at Pequod's, which wasn't remotely good. We went early on a Sunday evening--two hours after the Bears game had ended, so that's not even a valid excuse--and ordered two personal pizzas, two beers. That's it--not an especially complicated order. The place was lively, not what I'd call busy, and yet 75 MINUTES LATER our food still hadn't arrived and our inattentive server hadn't bothered to check in with us even a single time. I understand that deep dish takes a while longer to cook than thin crust, but seriously, there is no earthly reason for a pair of 7"" pizzas to require that much time. I appreciated the charred cheese and the savory sauce on the pizza that finally arrived, but it hardly made up for the wait or the poor service.",4,4,negative
3759,"As a Chicago native, I've tried just about all the mainstream pizza this city has to offer and Pequod's is definitely high on the list.  Luckily they are close by and in delivery range, otherwise, it might could be a trek depending on where you live (although I think they have an outpost in the northern burbs).  I always order a deep dish with garlic with some randomn combination of veggies.  I do notice the pizza seems a little bland w/o the garlic, imo.  Not to heavy on the cheese, which makes this pizza a little lighter than most deep dish, and as many have mentioned before, the caramelized crust is really delicious and unique to Pequod's - they have it down pat!If your hankerin' for some chi-town pizza, give Pequod's a go!",2,1,positive

3763,"I had to sign up just for this one! After waiting 2 hours for a half peperoni pan pizza, I open it up and it is cooked crisply. The bottom was half black and the peperoni crumbled to little pieces when you touched it (photos below). So once I got a hold of someone, the girl said it is supposed to be black around the edges. I said yeah, well its much more than that! To her credit she said she could give me a credit for next time or get a manger. I asked for a manger because I wanted half my money back, because I know they tried and I thought that would be fair. Well I sat on the phone with the manager, who did not believe me and said just like the girl, it is supposed to be black around the edges and some black spots on the bottom. I'm in Chicago, I think I have a good idea of what a pan pizza is supposed to look like! So, after ten minutes, oh and sending the manager a picture because he did not believe me, he finally said yeah it's over cooked! He continued to say we can send another, I said that's ok, I'm not ordering here again! Pequod's was recommended to me by a friend, not sure if we will be friends after I tried this burnt pizza! I don't know what's worse, that the manager didn't believe me or that they even let this pizza leave the store and get to my house!  I have had a pizza that wasn't right from other pizzeria's and they didn't question it, they took care of it immediately.  Going to keep with the other great pizza joints in Chicago like, LOU MALNATI'S, PIZZANO'S, AND PIECE PIZZA. this pizza went in the garbage, just like the managers customer service!  I hope you can keep them on the phone long enough to send them a picture of your burnt pizza!",11,2,negative

I did like the caramelized crust but it's still a lot of dough and a lot of sauce. If you have vegetarians with you or those who simply don't like certain ingredients, it's possible to only have toppings on half the pizza. Their garlic bread with cheese appetizer is tasty but you can't go wrong with anything melted cheese!I agree with a lot of Yelpers--they have GOT to change that horrible blue awning in front! It's a lot nicer inside and deceptively small (the 2nd floor is huge!).",5,3,negative

The space can get extremely crowded, but being there a little off-hours is makes more a more comfortable experience. They make the cheese perfectly burned around the edge of the pie, and the crust is crunchy. If you're a vegetarian, I'm curious if they use lard or not. Friend appetizers are OK. Don't get me wrong, fried anything is good, but they appear to prefrozen fried items. The pizza is definitely the highlight.",6,5,positive

As far as the pizza, we ordered two pan-styles: a pepperoni and mushroom, and a sausage, spinach, garlic and mushroom.  If the sauce had flavor, it would have been great, but we found that the sauce was too ketchup-like...like just an institutional canned variety off a food supply truck.   It didn't stand out to compliment the ingredients.  So...this being said, I think this is just our one time shot here.",6,0,negative

3785,"Five stars. This pizza is excellent!! I grew up in Chicago and I'll tell you, I would take this place any day over Lou's,Gino's or Uno's.  Just outstanding and consistent.

3786,"First off...let me say...as far as deep dish goes?  5 stars...my favorite in Chicago.  Here is why I'm giving it 2 stars, and just as a warning to other potential customers...They have a delivery map online with a quote that says ""Our delivery range covers most of north Chicago but if you live near the fringe call and see if we can make it to you, we are accustomed to making reasonable exceptions.""  It also states an additional $1.00 delivery charge for that.  No big deal.  I live 2 blocks north of the cutoff.  I was told that they could not deliver there.  She checked with a manager and said ""no"".  Normally, this wouldn't be a big issue, except it specifically states that if you live ""near the fringe""...which I consider 2 blocks to be...they are ""accustomed to making reasonable exceptions.""It's unfortunate because it takes an additional 30 seconds, which I would easily tip extra for.  They have lost a consistent delivery customer as a result, and has left a bad taste in my mouth for a place I otherwise drooled over.",4,3,negative
3787,"One of my all-time favorite pizza places ever!  This is by far the best deep dish pizza in Chicago!  I've tried so many different deep dish pizzas around town and all others just seem mediocre.  Once I tried Pequod's there was no going back!  I only let myself eat Pequods on special occasions, like after a triathlon or something, otherwise I would eat it ALL THE TIME!  It's the thing I look forward to the most after a race, because then I can eat all the pizza I want!  Hands down, best pizza in Chicago!",4,0,positive
3788,"Came during lunch and ordered the lunch special: 7 inch personal pizza with one topping and a soft drink or miller lite draft for $5. Available weekdays btwn 11 and 3 or 4. Ok for this price this place automatically gets 3 stars. Freakin' steal. I was very excited to come here because Pequod's is frequently mentioned as one of the best deep dishes in town, especially by locals and by people who know pizza. Sure if you are visiting for a weekend you might want to try some of the more famous pizzerias but if you've done all that, Pequod's is a must try. So I tried...""OMG OMG."" That's the reaction I wanted to have when I ate the pizza. But I didn't. It was a very good and solid pizza but it was missing the magical ""wtf"" moment that I had when I first bit into my pizza at Lou's or Uno's. Each bite didn't make me crave the next here. I think it's the crust. It wasn't special enough. Good but not special. I won't walk away remembering how great the crust is, and that's not good considering the incredible amount of competition in Chicago. Overall, a very good and solid pizza, and would be my go-to place if I were anywhere else but Chicago. But because I am in Chicago, I don't think I'll really ever hunt this place down again.",13,1,negative
3789,Some of the best pizza that can be found anywhere -- deep dish and thin slice -- but some the worst wine. I love just about everything but their wine. The red blend tasted like syrup and the Zinfandel was not much better. Love to see them get a cheap chianti and or a Tempranillo on their list.,4,2,positive
3790,"BEST deep dish pizza I've tried in Chicago so far (comparison points = Gino's and Lou Malnati's).  The secret is the seasoned pans they use for the pizzas - they line each pan with parmesan cheese so when you get the pizza out, there's a delicious ring of semi-burnt cheese around the outside of the crust.  Absolutely amazing.It's definitely worth the wait in my opinion and any time I am in the mood for some deep dish, Pequod's is my first choice!",3,0,positive

I took advantage of the Lunch Special which is a 7in. pan pizza with one topping and a drink for $5. The establishment was nice and clean and the pizza was good. Crust had a nice char along the outer edge and the tomato sauce complimented the other ingredients. I would have preferred a bit more cheese, but overall it is a very good pizza.

3798,"Providing a star rating for Pequod's is tough. I've had some great pizzas here and some disappointing ones. For the good pizzas, I would give it four stars, but for the disappointing ones, I would give it three stars. In the past year, I have had more disappointing visits than positive ones, so I must rate accordingly. However, my last visit was a good one and I'm hoping they're back on track so I can change the rating soon.The caramelized crust is a must-try, if they're on good run. I recommend adding garlic to your pizza for some extra flavor, especially if they're on a bad run. When it's bad, you need the extra flavor.I don't recommend the thin-crust, as the crust is not caramelized and doesn't have much flavor. The pan at least always has a charred crust, and on good days it's caramelized.I appreciate the local-leaning draft beer selection, although I wish they varied their Half Acre option more frequently, as it's usually the heavier Over Ale. With a pan pizza, I would prefer a lighter ale like the Gossamer.The appetizer options are pretty standard for a pizza place, but are not especially good. Overall, if Pequod's is on a good run, it's great pizza. These past two years, they have been a little off, but maybe they're heading into a good season based on my last visit. I hope so.",18,5,negative

3801,"I've got to say that I felt let down by Pequod's.  I enjoy all styles of pizza and most topping combos, but I found that Pequod's fell flat.  While the toppings were good (tomato, basil and garlic), there was just too much bread.  The crust was good and all, but it together it just didn't work.  Not enough topping, but the caramelized crust was good.  Also, cold pizza the next morning is usually yummy, but in this case, it only got worse...My recipe for success would be 1/2 the crust and and 3x the toppings, with more cheese (more cheese is always a good thing!)",8,3,negative

3803,"There's not much more that I can say about Pequod's pizza besides what my lovely Yelp Elite wife Kristy K penned in her love letter to Pequod's disguised as a Yelp review.  But at the risk of being repetitive, here we go.  Pequod's pan pizza is the best pizza in Chicago.  Forget about the ""big three"" Chicago-style pizzerias: Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's East.  None can compare to the glory of Pequod's.  In fact, Pequod's pan pizza is without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had in my life. My go-to order from Pequod's is a pan pizza with pepperoni and basil.  The deep dish crust at Pequod's is unlike any other crust ever:  thick, crispy, and chewy lined with caramelized cheese that adds a perfect crisp of cheesy goodness.  This caramelized cheese became a delicacy for my wife and we had to incorporate a ""slice draft"" by which took turns drafting slices of pizza to get the ones with the optimal caramelization.  Pequod's uses pans that are decades old, which I am convinced must somehow infuse decades of delicious spices and flavor into the crust of the pizza.  The pizza sauce at Pequod's is a mix of sweetness and spiciness with a delightfully fresh herbal component.  The cheese is fantastic.  And the pepperoni is phenomenal.  Unlike other pizzerias where you might get soggy flimsy pepperoni, Pequod's roasts their pepperoni before putting them on the pizza so that they become crispy, which creates a beautiful textural contrast with the melty cheese and sauce on top while pairing with the crisp bottom crust and outer caramelized cheese.  When you put all of these elements together, the greatest pizza of all-time is born.  When I talked to my friends back in Chicago, it always shocked me to find so many people who had never tried Pequod's.  What is wrong with you people!?!   Since moving from Chicago a year ago, the one single thing that I have missed more than anything in all of Chicago is Pequod's pizza.  There is no other pizza like it anywhere!  If you live in Chicago and have not had Pequod's, you are hurting me.  Just knowing that you could pick up the phone until 4 am and have a piping hot Pequod's pizza delivered to your doorstep -- but haven't -- while I simultaneously would do just about anything for that same pleasure and delight just crushes my soul.  For me (and for yourself), give Pequod's pizza a try.  Then again, if I had never tried Pequod's, then perhaps I would not be living the desperate existence that I am now:  pining for a pizza 1,000 miles away with no hope of finding a decent replacement.  All I know is that when I visit Chicago next time I am taking a cab directly from ORD to Pequod's.  I love you Pequod's and miss you more than you'll ever know (unless you read this review, I guess).",26,9,positive
3804,"Delicious pizza (especially the crust) but horrible, awful service! From placing the carry out order over the phone to picking it up, nothing but frustration and annoyance. Even though the food was good, I will never go back because it was such a hassle. The girl on the phone was preoccupied and couldn't get my name right (even after saying it 5 times and spelling it 3). Their carry out system is the WORST! I had to wait over ten minutes in their over crowded tiny restaurant! I was trying to avoid that anxiety by ordering carry out! And then they gave me the wrong appetizer when the receipt clearly read ""jalapeño poppers"". Incompetent and lazy staff. If the ""runner"" for carry out had shown an inch of hustle, I would have been more forgiving. But seriously, she walked and moved slower than my 86 year old grandmother. Sad, because this place has the potential for being the best deep dish in Chicago......",4,9,positive

I'm not such a fan of deep dish, but I heard Pequod's was different from typical deep dish pizza.  And yes, it was good...but not over the top good. And if I'm going to waste calories on pizza I'm expecting it to be over the top good.  Just a little too much of everything going on in this pizza- a bit too doughy & way too much cheese (and this is coming from a girl who loves her cheese so much she should have been a mouse).   I liked it enough to eat it (2 big pieces in fact), but not enough to crave it or really want to go back.However, the caramelized cheese crust of their pizza is worth 5 stars.  If I ever find myself back at Pequod's I'm hoping I can just order an entire pizza of the crust covered with caramelized cheese.

I really don't care about a long wait (it's a popular place), but just tell me the truth and bring out the food as it was ordered and I won't be upset. Most recently I decided to forego that experience and order delivery. Pizza is still great, but they still manage to screw something up. Most recently I had them repeat the order to me, even then they still manage to forget a salad and an ingredient on the pizza.

Not even salted, no pinch of sugar to get the yeast pumping. Just mixed bleached flour mixed with water and baked. The amount of cheese put on the pizza was insulting -- gobs and gobs of flavorless LMPS mozzarella.  I don't mind a lot of cheese, but if it tastes like rubber, I'll pass.The little bit of sauce under the cheese was pretty tasty, but not enough of it and hardly making up for the rest of this wretched pizzaService wise, we ordered for pickup, arrived 5 min after the time they said to come, had to push through a crows to find someone to talk to and then waited nearly 15 more minutes.",8,3,negative

3836,"Tried their sausage and fresh basil thin crust pizza.  The biggest difference I noticed that sets their pizza apart from others was the cheese.   Soo good.  And the sausage was tasty as always.  The basil I can't really comment on because they mostly forgot it initially and gave me a ton extra to put on top.  Honest mistake and they quickly and happily corrected it, but it's not the same uncooked.The place is also waay bigger than it seems.  There were two second floor seating areas and there was still a 45 minute wait (totally worth it).  They have a bar, so waiting isn't too bad.I would STRONGLY suggest putting in your order ahead of time.  You can actually call ahead, but I put my order in as soon as I started waiting in line.  Makes everyone happy.  They get their table back quicker and you get your awesome pizza asap.I'd definitely recommend Pequod's!",9,0,positive

3842,Greatest lunch special ever!  Personal pizza and a beer/pop for $5!  The pizza was delicious and the beer was nice and chilled.  The service was very friendly and quick; you could definitely be in and out on your 30 minute lunch break.  One of the best deals in town!,4,1,positive
3843,"From the outside, I was scared to enter... 90's awning, dirty...But I'm glad I did!! It was such a cool atmosphere with brick walls and a sports bar feeling.

3844,Worth the (long) wait. Go there when you think you might be hungry since you'll get the food by the time you're starving! Sausage and pepperoni deep dish with some cheesy bread is the ultimate meal!!,0,1,positive
3845,So incredibly good - it is definately a treat!  On the heavy side so couldn't order weekly.  People should know that the pizzas take a long time.  I thought it said it on the menu or it used to.  We walked in on a Sunday night around 6:30 - it was packed - but we still managed to get seated within 15 minutes.  We put our order in right away but it was a good 45 minutes - which we expected.  I watched 2 different tables get upset - one took their appetizers to go and cancelled the zaa and the other table just left.  What a mistake because their pan pizza is the best!,5,1,positive
3846,"From the outside the place doesn't look very appealing. However, the inside is very nice. Has the sports bar feeling. Garlic cheese bread was awesome! Soft and flavorful. Their fries look similar to McDonald's fries, but taste much better. The pan pizza with the caramelized crust was unbelievable! The sauce and cheese meshes well together on top of the bread. Additionally, I love how the bottom of the bread is seasoned and juicy. My wife really enjoys the thin crust pizza. However, I still prefer the pan pizza.My favorite toppings are sausage, pepperoni, and basil. I'm craving their pizza as I write this review.They are open until 2am so its a great late night spot. Also, if you order their garlic cheesy bread make sure to order marinara sauce as it doesn't come with the dish.  Pequod's pizza is a true taste of Chicago pizza!",12,2,positive
3847,"I will admit, I am a newbie to real Chicago-style pizza but this was the best pizza I've ever had. I could eat just the crust. I'm waiting to try some of the other Chicago spots to compare but this was a great place to start",2,0,positive
3848,"SO glad John, with the Chicago Pizza Tour, decided to put Pequod's on the list during our visit! Out of all the place's we tried, I would have Pequod's any day! It's the only slice I actually finished. MMMM.... The burnt cheesy crust? Crazy good. Plus, it was the only place with Blue Moon on tap. Definitely made me happy after searching for it all day. I understand the whale, but is that a thong on it's head? Why? Maybe we'll go try out Burt's Place today, we'll see how/if it differs =)Thanks, Burt!",3,1,positive
3849,"The whole family went to Pequod's for lunch today (Sat) around 12:45.  We found a place to park without any problems and walked to the restaurant.  It isn't as big as I thought it would be, although there is an upstairs that we didn't see.  It is pretty dark but I thought it had a lot of character with the brick walls, open to the street seating and the lighting. We were seated immediately in a booth at the back.  Our server got to our table about a minute later and took our drink order.  Their draft beer selection isn't too exciting but they had a few Goose Island brews along with Great Lakes so we were a-ok.  We ordered cheesy garlic bread to start.  They brought it out after maybe 10 mins so it wasn't too bad.  You pretty much get 2 decent size pieces.  We just cut each in half and enjoyed.  It was very cheesy and had great crisp, almost burnt ends.  They were the best part!!!  We ordered a large pan sausage and pepperoni.  It did take about 20 mins which wasn't a big deal.  It is fun to people watch and they have tv's scattered throughout.  The pizza was very good.  It is thick with lots of toppings.  The crust was awesome!! We will go back.  It's in a fun, busy neighborhood with lots of other places to visit nearby.",12,4,positive
3850,"I like Pequod's. We went again for the second time recently and I liked it much better than the first time I had it. The crust was very crispy, the dough was not too doughy, and it had the perfect amount of toppings, cheese, and sauce. It's a great place to stop and split a pizza with friends before a movie. I can't say I'd drive over here to eat it, though. It's good and I am a fan...but not a fanatic. Skip the small salad and the creamy garlic dressing. It's blah, with 1,000 black olives, 1 slice of a Roma tomato, and 1 tablespoon of shredded carrots. The creamy garlic dressing tasted like sour cream with garlic powder mixed in. We should've split the fried zucchini. :( Oh well, lesson learned. I'm not sure why people refer to this as deep dish - it's not. It's pan pizza, it even says so on their menu. If you want deep dish pizza, don't come here. If you want great pan pizza, come here. We've never had a wait during the week, but we usually go to 7pm movies and get here around 5:30. When we do head out, I see only about 1 or 2 tables open, I can only imagine how nuts it is on the weekend. Great place to stop before heading over to the movie theater.",9,6,positive
3851,"This is not a fancy place by any means, a place for a pizza and beer in a bar-like setting. The staff is friendly, the prices aren't outrageous and the food is good. They are known for their thick crust pizza but we had their thin crust. It's not super thin by any means, but it has a great sauce and is loaded with toppings. We also had the Pequod salad which is plenty big to share. That comes with black olives, tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni, pepperoncinis, mushrooms, onions, shredded carrots, and green peppers. Oh and lettuce, of course! This place happens to be right across the street from the move theater which is very convenient as well!",8,0,negative
3852,"A solid 3 stars. After reading many reviews about this place I decided to give it a try. It was delicious! The pizza was great. My husband and I got a deep dish with basil and sausage. We loved it and would've been kinder with the stars if it hadn't been for the wait. The wait was ridiculous. I am thoroughly disappointed in what happened. Usually when you do a reservation/table request you get the time that you reserve it for. Not here!!! I reserved a table a few days ago with a confirmation for a yes to 7:30 PM. My husband and I were done exploring Chicago and went to our reservation at pequod's. We were blown away by how busy it was and thought well no need to worry we had reservations... WRONG. I put my reservation at 7:30, got there at 7:20 and didn't get in until 8:40. I was pretty annoyed by then. Thankfully the food came pretty quick and quick meaning 40 minutes. It was delicious like I said, don't get me wrong, but I was disappointed in my so called reservation. I don't remember reading anything on the website that my table request is worth nothing. Pretty aggravated. If I would've known the wait was that long even with ""reserving,"" we would have made a reservation at 6:30 PM and came at 7:30 PM. Oh well. Good food Pequod's, but you messed up on your wait time. We might come back and we might refer people, but I suggest you put that on the table request page of your website that there is still a wait or another person will be peeved because that is definitely not how reservations work.",12,6,negative
3853,"I don't often say this - but I LOVE my brother. Yes, purely because he insisted that I go to Pequod's... it is BY FAR the best advice he has ever given me in his life. My friends and I made the trek over here on my brother's word alone. Yes, we were running later then we wanted to be for a show uptown more, yes it was freezing cold and raining, and yes we were having trouble finding a cab and ended up walking the whole way. and YES IT WAS WORTH IT. When we first walked into the place I thought we would be waiting for hours, but they lead us upstairs and all the way to the other end of the restaurant and sat us immediately. We explained we were in a bit of a hurry and the waitress did great bringing us all our drinks quickly and getting our order in - even with it being packed! They had a great beer list (something that is very important to me) and also had a pretty great special on a shot of whiskey with a beer - can't go wrong there! The pizza is absolutely delish! All the ingredients so fresh and the best sausage I think I've ever had on a pizza. The warm gooey cheesey meaty combination made the walk in the freezing rain a distant memory and all my troubles were gone. Yes. Its that good. The sauce? Phenomenal! the crust being made partially out of caramelized cheese??? ohhhhh my goodness! My advice is not to get anything bigger then a medium because it is SO filling. We couldn't really take it with us either because we didn't want to take it around to all the bars that night - it was pretty heartbreaking. A medium would have easily fed 4 people - we had two four the for of us (mostly because one of us was a vegetarian and we didn't want to miss out on this heavenly sausage -  but still two smalls would have been more then fine!). I saw that someone wrote so not worth the wait. I know I didn't have to wait at all (thank goodness because we would have had to leave), but I would not be angry to wait an hour or two for this goodness!

3865,"Well....my boyfriend and I stopped in here, prompted by the plentiful Yelp reviews and high rating as we passed through Chicago on our way from NYC to rural IL for a wedding.We ordered two salads and a small deep dish pizza with black olives to split. The salad was hard to eat. The lettuce was tough and tasted very bitter.The pizza...was disappointing. Granted we are used to thin crust pizza(I am a waitress in a place that serves amazing brick oven thin crust pizza) or the thinner crust regular NYC style pies, but the thing that bothered me about this pizza was that the crust, like the part under the cheese and sauce I mean, was very sweet. I also felt that there was a ton of cheese on the pie and not that much sauce. The one very good thing about this pizza was the outside crust. The cheese and bread caramelized to form this amazingly tasty crunchy ring around it. I wish the whole pizza tasted that irresistible!Service was unwelcoming. There were college kids working there and the hostess rolled her eyes a lot and they huddled in the corner chatting and eating cereal from a ziplock bag while leaning all over the bar and looking generally miserable and unenthused- the kind of behavior that would get me in trouble at any of the places I worked.",10,5,negative
3866,"Be prepared for LONG WAITS and an OVERCROWDED RESTAURANT! I struggled a little with whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars and had to settle with 3. The pizza is great! The crust is crisp and crunchy with nice flavors. The cheese and toppings are very tasty while the sauce is a little sweeter than my liking but still good tasting none the less. The restaurant itself is mad house. You're going to wait for a table in a small crowded area at the front. You're going to wait for drinks, and for your order to be taken and you're going to wait for your pizza. They told us 30 minutes and we ended up getting our pizza more than 50 minutes after we ordered. I was not happy with the service here, this is the reason for the lower rating. But the pizza was so damn good, I can't stop thinking of having more. I strongly recommend you get takeout here! Pizza should not be a two hour experience and that's what your in for if you decide to eat here.

3867,"I've been here twice now and I think I may have failed on ordering both times.  I knew the deep dish was what you come here for but I think I was confused or maybe drunk, I don't know.  The first time we ordered thin crust.  Right?  Seriously, it's like going to a steakhouse and ordering pasta.  I'm a moron.  It was still good pizza, don't get me wrong.  Nothing to do a little dance about.Six months later we made it back, yay!  We ordered the deep dish, yay!  I let my husband pick toppings and he went completely overboard, boo.  Sausage, mushroom, green pepper and onion.  I did not realized what a pile of stuff was going to come on our pizza.  Lots of toppings are okay for thin crust but deep dish, I really just want to taste crust, sauce, cheese.  The sausage pieces are about as big as my ears, FYI.  So it was deece but nothing mindblowing like I was honestly expecting.  The carmelized crust was okay but I'm thinking it would be even better if it wasn't suffocated by the garden growing on top of it.So I need to go back once more and get either a cheese or one topping pizza to figure out how it REALLY is.  The good part is that I love the vibe of this place, the servers are all really nice and pizzas don't take tooo long to arrive.  We always have an easy time finding parking on the weeknights too so I'll be back...",11,4,negative

The pizza does take a bit longer than most other places, so if you want fast and mediocre pizza, go somewhere else. Definitely order the pan and load it with toppings. We had the pan with mushrooms, pepperoni, and black olives and it was nothing short of perfection. It is very filling though, so I'm not usually able to eat more than a piece and a half. The large for two people is way more food than you will need, but I was excited for the leftovers the next day. Oh, and the re-heated leftovers were almost as good as the pizza was the first time.

We saw a few cops eating in the place and figured, hey, if there's cops eating there, it's probably not awful.It wasn't awful. The service was spot-on- our waitress was very attentive, refilled my drink often, and asked how things were. The ambiance was all right- a sort of dive-y, bring your kids kind of place. There were flat screens tuned to the Sox game. The small salad I had was fresh and good, but the (thin crust) pizza wasn't my favorite. The pineapple on the pizza was in full rings- which made it difficult to eat given the fact that the pizza is cut into the little squares. The toppings and cheese slid off the pizza, leaving you with either a mouthful of cheese and toppings or a mouthful of bread. There wasn't much flavor to the pizza, and I wasn't a fan of the braided crust- it just seemed overly dry, flavorless, and burned. Generally, I love the crusts on pizza, but this one- not so much. The boyfriend seemed to like it, but I wouldn't order it again.Overall our experience was good- but the waitress really earned the three stars, because without the friendly service I'd have given this place the minimum one star. Also, it seemed a bit pricey for what it was- a medium pizza with two toppings, a small salad, a soda, and two (not fancy) beers cost $40 with a tip.",8,3,negative

The waitress indicated they may need that table for others but fortunately it was not needed. We ordered cheese garlic bread and chicken strips as appetizers and two medium deep dish pizzas, both of which were plenty for 5 adults. The food was tasty but I must admit the deep dish pizza from Lou Malnati's is much better. Overall it was a good experience, though it can get loud later in the evening.",4,1,negative
3899,"Pequods is hands down my favorite pizza in Chicago. This isn't to say it's my favorite Chicago stlye pizza, however. To be fair Pequods, as advertised, is pan pizza at its finest. It's not the stuffed or deep dish variety that other Chicago joints serve up and I like it that way. Burnt, camalized edges and crispy pepperoni with just enough cheese to hold up to the delicious crust underneath.The atmosphere is inviting with exposed brick walls and a dimly-lit bar room setting. There are booths for two and those that offer more seating as well as tables and stools around the bar. The staff is very friendly and seem to enjoy working together which is nice, as most places I venture into...it seems service is lacking.The waitress I had around lunch hour greeted me quickly and took my order... had my beverage out just as fast and asked how I was doing. The manager on duty also came by to ensure all was OK.They offer a great lunch special. A personal pan pizza and cola or Miller Light pint for $4.95. This is unbeatable. Expect to wait about 20 minutes for your pie to cook. It'sworth it even if you are sitting alone guzzling a pint of Miller Light in the middle of the afternoon.The overall experience here is enjoyable. I'll be back, as I always am and I'll continue to refer friends to this place for a great slice of pan pizza.Great atmosphere, great service, all around great neighborhood pizza stop!",19,0,positive

I probably wouldn't get it again.-Pan pizza with the caramelized crust was pretty awesome.

3901,"Delicious deep-dish! So much better than Lou Malnattis! This pizza is so good. Went with a friend and we shared a small deep-dish, which was the perfect amount for 2 people. Scoped out other tables and it seems that the medium was good for parties of 3-4, with a large (plus appetizers) being ideal for a party of 5.The sauce is delicious and the crust is a great consistency (and doesn't taste like it was just de-thawed like the crust from Lou Malnattis).Will definitely come back!",9,0,positive

3908,"Stopped in here the other night to try it for the first time. We ordered a deep dish sausage and pepperoni. I had a group of 4 and we are some pizza veterans so we are hard to please and all have different tastes. Plus, we have tried all the north and south side pizza joints and downtown too. Pequods was hands down the greatest pizza I have ever had. The dough was perfect, sauce was perfect, the carmalized cheese edges were great. It was really the best. A z-large fed 4 people perfectly and we grabbed two orders of fries for a side dish. The price for that was great. The only down side was the beer prices. There are absolutely no drink specials all week long and a pitcher cost us around $18. Kind of expensive for a neighborhood place but it's ok. If i go again, I'll skip the beer and hit a bar afterwards. Like I said everything else was perfect. The atmosphere is fun and the customer service is great too.",10,2,positive

I definitely want to return to try a few different toppings but overall we had a great experience here.

3934,"LATE REVIEW:  I tried this place a few months back with my girlfriend, who along with several of her co- workers, raved about the pizza.  We decided to dine in, and that's when dinner took a horrible turn.  Our server seemed very preoccupied with the other tables which seemed to be a good sign until we quickly noticed that group didn't include our table.  After a long wait for a menus, we finally got some love.  Within roughly two minutes, our server returns asking what we want to order.  She was a bit about it.  I said we'd need another moment as this was my first visit.  She returns after a while and we're ready, order the pie, and she  immediately walks away.  We didn't even get the chance to order drinks before we vanished. We get her attention after a few more minutes and informed her we wanted beverages too(usually servers ask).  No hey sorry about that, nothing.  I realize that place was busy, but she gave me the impression that we were inconveniencing her.  At this point I say to my girlfriend, ""if the service is normally this terrible, the food must be exceptionally good.""  I lose again.  Their famous deep dish I had heard so much about left so much to be desired.  I can only conclude most of their patrons are not native Chicagoans.  It even took way too long to get the check.  She just averted her eyes from us.  I don't get it.  Worse part of all is I spent 50 bucks a meal that was not only mediocre, but we were treated almost like we weren't welcome their.  I paid and left quietly.  I feel like the owner of this place stole from me.  I curious to know what qualifies one to get decent service here,  as it appearing others were recieving.  Its a win win, I never have to eat there again, and they get to keep my money anyway.  Screw one customer, it won't hurt business.",12,5,negative
3935,"My friends living in Chicago all recommended Pequod's as the best chicago deep dish out there and when I tried it, I ended up ordering 2 more pie's for my drive back to St. Louis so that I could eat it back there.

I got the pepperoni deep dish pizza which with the combination of the cheese is terrific.One of my coworkers was going to visit Chicago from St. Louis and was driving up with his family and wanted to know some good places to see and restaurants to eat at there. I told him a bunch of good places but he cut me off and wanted to know a good deep dish pizza place first. So I told him Pequod's and then gave him my list of other good restaurants. Well. He got there on Friday night with his family and went straight to Pequod's for dinner. They absolutely loved the deep dish pizza and every single one of their meals after, they ate at Pequod's. They completely ignored my other restaurant lists and just went to Pequod's. On Sunday, they ate there at lunch and ordered 4 more deep dishes to go to bring back to St. Louis. One for me for telling them about this place and 3 more for food for the rest of the week.",11,0,positive
3936,"Wow, I can't believe I'm updating this again, and dropping more stars.  A couple of nights ago we ordered a deep dish pizza for delivery.  Things were bad from the start.  The person who took our order didn't repeat it back to my husband.  We ended up with a medium pizza, instead of the large we ordered.  However, in their favor, they charged us the price of a medium.  Things were even worse once we opened up the box.The pizza arrived within the 1 hour we were quoted.  However, the pizza was stone cold, and it also looked like it had been dropped.  The crust had fallen off many of the pieces, and some of the toppings had completely slid off the pizza.  It was so cold, we had to cook it in the oven for about 12 minutes to get it to a good temperature.  It was very bland, and basically we felt like the kitchen staff half-assed it.When I called to complain, the manager decided to only charge us half price, and put a credit back on our card.I hate to say it, but the inconsistency of Pequod's will definitely make me hesitate before I order from them again.  We've now had several mediocre deep  pizzas with a only few great ones sprinkled amongst the pizzas we've had delivered from Pequod's over the past year or so.  Something has definitely changed, and not for the better.",6,9,negative

3940,"My BF has been talking about this place and their caramelized cheese for quite some time, so I finally broke down and agreed to go.   We ordered carry-out for a large pan pizza with sausage, onion and mushroom.

Luckily it was thick enough that there was still a hint of crunch left.  Maybe that caramelized cheese had something to do with it...The overall flavor was great!  The veggies were fresh. There was a good amount of sausage throughout, however, I personally would have preferred a little more cheese (un-caramelized) . Having said that, if you have the time/ patience to wait for a table, I would. I'm sure had we done that, my rating would have been higher.",6,2,negative

Add in the sports/frat element and I was sure I was gonna hate it.Nope.The pizza is really, pretty d@mn good. Pardoned from the Palette Bistro Fiasco™, I was, once again, allowed to pick toppings for the pizza. One stuffed with sausage, peppers and basil and one thin with pepperoni, peppers and garlic and we were in business. The stuffed (or is it deep dish; 6+ years and I still don't know) was very enjoyable. The crust was crispy and caramelized (THE deciding factor) and made every bite a race to get to the end. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was just the consistency I like. Usually, I am all about the thin crust. Here, I would (and did) eat both. Add in a Chimay and the first game of the Stanley Cup finals and you have one surprisingly enjoyable experience. I am rarely in this part of town and after my trip here, I wondered why that is. There are many shops on this stretch of Clyborn and Pequod's is a Chicago institution that deserves my respect. After eating here, it's earned my patronage.",7,2,positive

3950,"Since moving to Chicago, I've been kind of a pizza slut.  I've hooked up with Giordano, Gino, Lou Malnati, Eduardo, Pizano, Sarpino, and  regrettably Papa John. I wanted it all kinds of ways - deep dish, thin crust, it didn't matter. But then I met Pequod's. The kind of pizza place that makes an honest woman out of you. The love affair began with caramelized cheese crust and the passion is kept alive by, well, caramelized cheese crust. Because of the bond I feel with Pequod's, I felt confident enough that the pizza would wow my out of town friends and give my Chicago-based friends an alternative to deep dish. Pequod's did not disappoint. I was able to make a reservation for 15 people on a Saturday night 4 days prior to the date (just an FYI, they will charge your credit card $25 if you don't show up for your reservation), which impressed and relieved me. It was extremely hot in the restaurant - I'm guessing that 90 degree temps outside and constantly running pizza ovens aren't helping the case, but I would've appreciated a little extra AC so my white shorts didn't become translucent with sweat. Would I let a little perspiration taint this review? Not hardly. Thankfully our waitress kept the pitchers of beer coming and saved us all from dehydration. The pizza was delicious, as I knew that it would be. Everyone at our table earned clean plate awards, even if some (myself included) needed some extra prodding to eat another piece. I enjoy the fact that the pizza isn't as heavy and cheesy as other deep dishes tend to be. That doesn't mean that we didn't need to be rolled out of there, because we did, it just means that I didn't have a cement brick of cheese in my stomach post-meal. In addition to being tasty, Pequod's is cheap! Relatively speaking anyway. If you're not drooling after reading all of the Yelp reviews about the deliciousness, then maybe pizza just doesn't do it for you. And if that's the case, then I feel sorry for you because you're truly missing out.",15,7,positive

With that being said I am so unbelievably irritated by the 16 year olds running the front door. My goodness I came in at 7 pm called ahead of time I understood it was a two hour wait.  This was no surprise,  a place like this I would expect nothing less.  The problem here is I talked this place up to my family for a few days, they were in town visiting....So anyway I walked in at 7 pm they said the wait is two hours.  So I explained to the kids up front running wait list I get the wait is two hours we would like to put our name on the list well be back at 9pm. They put our name on the list...great.... Two hours later we get there at 9pm on the dot.  I get they don't take reservations. Any who, the same kid that took my name down I tell him hey bud we put our name on the list at 7pm we decided we would go down the street to a bar instead of scratch myself on the sidewalk for two hours.....This kids with a big ole smirk on his face tells me is gonna be another hour wait and we're checked in at 9pm....wait is 50 mins........what?! I explain to the kid (s) didn't you say it was a two hour wait at 7pm and you TOOK THE NAME DOWN AT 7PM! Not one crap given, instead I got this 16 year old giving me a huge smirk right to my face and making jokes to his coworkers like I was the bleeping pinata....then went on to respectively run his mouth....the point being, teach your employees to represent your business with respect. That's the crap the loses business and gets your clientele talking poor about your business.  Fix it. 5stars for pizza, 1 star for service.",11,5,negative

The caramelized crust is something great (you can see Little Caesar's try to copy them with the new crappy deep dish they're putting out). However, the appetizers I had were just not that good. My mozzarella sticks were underfried, and the Jalepeño Poppers did not taste very fresh (probably frozen!).The place was packed, it is very cozy, but I had a great seat on the top floor near a window where I could see out to street. Great atmosphere!",8,2,positive
3954,"I had heard about this place awhile ago and then when another friend mentioned that a coworker of his recommended it, we decided to go. We ended up getting a table on the second floor and each ordered our own small pizza. I had spinach and he ordered sausage. I'm a HUGE fan of Giordano's and this pizza was different from theirs, but different doesn't mean bad. Basically, there was less cheese, more sauce. A good amount of spinach, although I feel there could have been more, but I don't know that most people love spinach as much as I do. The most interesting thing about the pizza is the carmelized crust, which makes the crust worth eating if you're not normally a fan of the crust. My friend was figuring that he could finish off the small pizza, but that didn't happen. It's definitely more filling than it appears to be. We could have shared one pizza and finished it (if only we could have agreed on a vegetarian one!) but instead, we both ended up taking home leftovers. I had my leftovers two days later and it was almost as yummy as the night we had the pizza in the restaurant. I would definitely go back again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. Giordano's continues to maintain a special place in my Chicago style pizza eating heart.",5,1,negative

I think I actually like the location in Morton Grove better, for the divey ambiance, but the pizza is killer at either location.As many, many others have said, the crust is amazingly caramelized and crispy. They don't dump a ton of cheese on the pizza, so you can actually taste the sauce and crust. A must try!",4,1,positive

3959,Not worth the wait!   Called in the morning to get a preferred seating time.   Arrived 1.5 hours before out time hoping to get in a little early.  Waited over two hours to get in even though people off the street were getting in before us.  Inquired a number of times about our wait and was given one excuse after another why our calling ahead did not guarantee a time.  At one point I even saw the list with names after ours crossed off as being seated.  Still remained patient thinking the food would be worth the wait.   Their famous Chicago deep dish pizza was anything but.  There are many other places in Chicago for a pizza.  Do not waste your time with Pequods.,5,2,negative

3963,"In a city filled with and known for amazing deep dish pizza, it can be difficult to stick out. You've got your Uno's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's Gino's East, etc. How's a (relatively) small pizza chain with a questionably pronounceable name supposed to stand out? Lou's has their delicious toppings, Giordano's has cheese portions that cause the Food Pyramid to crumble, Gino's has their sauce and what does Pequod's have? Their crust. Their delicious, caramelized crust with seasoning soaked right into the pans they emerge from, akin to a fine whiskey absorbing the flavors and aromas in its cask. Rounding out the pies are fresh toppings, just enough cheese to drape the sides of your slice and sauce with the slightest hint of sweetness.If one were to nitpick (not me, just... one), the top floor can get relatively loud when the place gets packed, simply due to the narrow areas near the back reflecting the charming sound of people yelling at televisions. But then again you're not here for the atmosphere. You're here to get your pizza on.Oh yeah, they have a fantastic lunch special of a personal pizza and drink for under five bucks. You'd spend more grabbing lunch at potbelly's.",10,2,positive

3968,"How can you tell you're truly a Chicagoan after moving from another city?  The though of Chicago Stuffed Dish pizza makes your stomach turn a knot at its mere sight.  We've all been there.  We transplant from some Big10/Midwest school, move into our Lincoln Park/Wrigleyville dive spot and order Giordano's constantly for the next 3 months because we LOVE chi deep dish pizza.  Twelve months later, your frat brother from Columbus comes to visit and insists on ordering Chi's most famous pizza and you are absolutely revolted at the thought of consuming any more. That's where Pequods comes in to save the day (sorry for the long intro).  Best Pizza In The City....I know bold statement.  The deep dish is unlike anything I've ever had.  In what had to be the byproduct of a deal with the devil, the crust is the best part of the pizza.  The ring of cheese they put around the crust that caramelizes to perfection makes the pizza.  I wish they would make breadsticks like this, but it wouldn't be the same.  The pizza itself is very good, tons of ingredients, but its very heavy.  One slice will fill you up, two will knock you out, three....well.....",5,2,positive

3974,"Just ate here for our first time after hearing  a lot of hype about the place... NOT IMPRESSED!! We ordered mozzarella sticks and a large pan pizza, simple enough, or so we thought. After 30 minutes, we asked the server where our sticks were. She clearly had forgotten all about them as she rushed away and had the cooks drop them. 40 minutes after the order was taken, we finally had 7 crappy little sticks of undercooked cheese. Our pizza took an hour and a half, while other patrons who were seated a half hour after us were done and leaving by time ours came up. The server we had clearly didn't know what the hell she was doing, even though she claimed she had been serving there for 14 years, yikes! She couldn't remember simple drink orders! My brother was waiting for his beer for 15 minutes before we had to remind her about it. She said ""oh you ordered another beer through me?"". We said, ""yes, duuuh!"" Thats when she explained to us she had been serving for 14 years and yada yada yada. She even told me that I wasn't smiling enough, WTF. I'm a paying customer, I don't have to smile especially if the service sucks. She got so flustered that she refused to serve us and we WERE NOT being mean and nasty, just unhappy. Super unprofessional on her part. On my way out we spoke with a manager briefly. The waitress then walked by and I muttered ""14 years of sucking ass"". I admit that was rude and immature, but then she fired right back with ""GO SUCK A DICK!"". WOW! At that point I just walked out and said that will be the one and only time I ever spend money there. I can't believe she said that, and in front of other customers. And finally, the pizza was mediocre at best which gives them their measly 1 star. Definitely nowhere near Lou Malnati's and Gioradano's quality. It makes sense they only have 1 location with all the rift raft that works there. Luckily, for that terrible waitress my brother is a better/nicer man than I and left her a 5 spot. If I had it my way it woulda definitely been a big fat STIFF!! Trust me go elsewhere, don't listen to your drunk friends. I will make sure to let everyone and anyone know just how bad this place sucks.

3975,"I went to Pequod's in Lincoln Park tonight with Windy City Pizza Club.  They took our reservation because we had a large party and honored it with a nice table in the upstairs area.  The tables were nice, but the lighting was poor.  I suppose the building is just old though.  The menu was pretty good with a basic amount of pizza which was expected from places that specialize in making good crust.I ordered a Pan Sausage 10 inch which is a pretty awesome size wise as it feeds 1-2 people with 4 giant slices.  I really like burnt crust and this was awesome stuff. They caramelize the crust to a dark brown color and crunchy texture.  The pizza itself was good, not great as it had way too much tomato sauce.  I really liked the crust and sausage!Obviously, I was with a group of 20 people which usually results in semi slower service, but shouldn't have been this slow.  I am not sure if they didn't have enough servers on, but it was pretty terrible.  By far the worst service I have ever had at a pizza place.  Don't get me wrong, our waitress was sweet and nice and helped us out, but it was extra slow tonight.  The pizza's took almost an hour to come out, and some pizza's got screwed up in the kitchen and came out even later than that.  Water service was slow but not important as there were no bus boys on duty. Again, the pizza was definitely good, not great, and our waitress was nice, but the actual service wasn't good.  The check actually came out with just a bunch of numbers on it.  We had no clue what they stood for until we had it clarified for us.   I would go back, but not with a large group.1-10 Stars would be a 6.  Till next month...",24,9,negative

Other pizzas nearby are sooooo much better like Art of Pizza. and nearly all others. I do understand how tough the restaurant business can be. Maybe they had an off night? I am very hesitant but maybe some day I will give it one more try, but then again, maybe not.",8,4,negative
3979,"In a city known for pizza, this is one not worthy of the hype. First time writing a review on Yelp, I tend to be more direct with my critique. I came for lunch and experienced horrible service. There were three servers eating their lunch as I waited to place MY ORDER and the waitress failed to put my order in which I was notified 30 min after placing it. I took it upon myself to notify the manager who said the waitress did not tell him probably because she screwed up on another customer's credit card...wtf!!! It seemed like complaints of bad service was routine for him. Also, the cheap lunch is the only thing special about this place...Gino's East is much better!!!!",3,7,negative
3980,"Ugh, Pequod's. I struggled between giving this place 3 or 4 stars. I'll go with 3.5 stars. I think it's because about a million people raved to me about Pequod's and after pumping myself up and waiting about 2 hours for the pizza, I was left sorely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely GOOD pizza. But overrated. I definitely recommend calling ahead and making a ""reservation"" especially on weekend nights. It's not a real reservation but just a shorter wait time once you get to the restaurant. Regardless we waited about an hour on a Friday night, which was fine and expected. The restaurant itself is rather dingy and way too dark. I came with a group of four girls and we were going to probably eat each other before the pizza came out so we ordered the cheesy garlic bread. It was not very good. The bread wasn't toasted nearly enough. :( It made me sad. We ordered one medium and one large pan pizza because we had the hangers and ended up taking most of the large pizza home (not surprisingly). The sauce and toppings were really good, especially the sausage (huge chunks) and pepperoni. But it couldn't make up for the fact that it was just overwhelmingly plain-tasting crust and not enough sauce/toppings. The burned cheese crust was definitely the best part. And how cheap it was! We ended up paying $10 a head for all that food. Their lunch deal sounds awesome -$5 for a drink and personal pan. I think I'd go back, just never on the weekend.",8,9,negative

Pequod's  thin crust isn't actually NY style thin crust - it's a medium thickness between NY style and deepdish and they pack in the toppings beneath gooey cheese set on a comforting crispy  warm carmelized crust. It's a crust you actually want to eat, not leave on your plate! No recommendations on toppings - just pile on whatever you like! I've had pineapple/ham, sausage/mushroom, spinach/mushroom, i mean it doesn't MATTER what you put on your pizza here! it's just AWESOME!Thank goodness they expanded this place to 2 floors! The wait was getting unbearable. This past time I sat upstairs - great sports bar setting!  Go for the craft brews!",6,1,positive

4019,"Pequods has officially done the impossible. I have finally met a pan pizza worth raving about!Before my ex took me here two years ago (whomp whomp), I was loathe to let a piece of pan cross my lips. I mean what was the point? It wasn't thin, foldy and greasy and it sure as shit wasn't stuffed!!! (Still my absolute fave.) My mentality was save myself the calories and walk down the street to Art of Pizza. But much like Sarah Palin, Pequods is a game-changer. Maybe its the sauce, maybe its the memories or maybe its the carmelized cheese burnt right into the deliciously buttery crust (impossible to leave it on the plate).Pequods is good for take-out, delivery, a Hawks game or the non-cinematic half of a dinner-movie combo (the Webster theater is right across the street.) Can't promise you'll have better luck romantically than I did, but the pan is more than worth the shot :)",11,5,positive

4023,"Sports bar pizzeria1. Sad to read about the owner's daughter passing away from cancer. She looked like a lovely young woman. I'm humbled by how they took such a tragedy and turned it into a positive by creating a scholarship fund in her name. If the place was crap, I'd still support it just by this utilitarian virtue. 2. FoodBruchetta- pretty pricey. My friends from NYC apparently loved it. I thought it was too salty and the basil was wilted. But in their weekend here we went to Pequod's *twice* and they got the bruchetta each time. PizzaI don't dig chicago style deep dish, especially the dough-cheese-soggy dough-sauce technique. Thank god pequod's doesn't do this, they do thick dough, *scant* cheese (I had a plain cheese and was struggling to find any cheese), and copious sauce. That caramelized crust is ridiculously good and their trademark. And it is simply the *thickest* dough base I've ever come across, it's almost too thick dare I say. In the end, I'm still used to the non-Chicago, dough-sauce-cheese style. I wonder if I can get my next pan pizza like that. I'll be bringing my parents here when they come visit.",10,5,positive
4024,One of the best deep dish pizza's I've ever had. I'm more of a thin crust guy myself but when in chi town I suggest this place. The caramelized cheese is what separates this spot from the others. I actually thought it tasted better left over!,2,0,positive

4026,"Chicago = deep dish, so on a recent trip, I had to get some. Origianlly I was leaning toward Lou Malnati's but on recommendation of others here, I came here instead. And it was... very, very good. Was it better than Lou Malnati's or any of the other famous spots in the city? It's hard for me to say. I thoroughly enjoyed the pie we got, which was exactly what I was expecting. It's not something I would eat every day or week, but for a one-time thing, it was great. It just wasn't transcendent. I don't know, maybe I'm grading too hard. There's literally nothing to complain about. But I just feel like maybe I could have gotten the same pie elsewhere. Am I wrong??? I'm happy to be convinced otherwise.",8,4,positive
4027,"Yum!Went on a Monday night, it was bustling but not crowded.  I definitely recommend heading upstairs and getting a big comfy booth.  The upstairs was much quieter - there were still games on TV, but I think the TVs were muted.  They didn't mind at all that my group sat and talked for quite awhile.Pizza came out very quick and was delicious.  Good variety of drinks available and the prices are great for the quantity and quality of food.  Prices for fried sides looked a little high but that was probably for the best as it encouraged me to skip the sides and save room for yummy pizza :)",8,2,positive

4029,"I'm not crazy about deep dish pizza, but this changed my mind, as the flavor and texture was very strong. I don't really have much to add other than that, but I will say that, as someone who microwaves his leftover pizza, this stuff does not microwave well at all. Guess the microwave is a friend of, I dunno, medium-crust pizza? At Pequod's, it's either deep or thin, and I think neither one really takes to reheating that well.My first visit, actually, resulted in me going to the Thai restaurant next door as I didn't want to wait forever by myself on a Friday night (and you know, I doubt they wanted me to either... I learned my lesson after Food 4 Go). I went to the Thai joint next door which was a mistake (three stars, huh Yelp? I don't think so). Reviews are available on both if you are curious!

4033,"BOMB.  Loved the 'caramelized' crust in the pan pizza.  What they do is put cheese on the crust so that it bakes to a crisp while in the oven.  GENIUS.  We got two medium pies for 6 people, and it was a hefty amount.  One was sausage and pepperoni.  The sausage was huge chunks and delicious.  The second was spinach and mushrooms.  Overall an amazing deep dish experience.  I've always favored Lou Malnatis for their cornmeal butter crust, but Pequod's may have risen to the top of my deep dish list.",5,1,positive
4034,"This review is for the delivery service only.  Usually I have had Pequod's at the restaurant - pan pizza is superior to their thin crust which I find pretty bland.We wanted to order pizza delivery last night but didn't want to go with our normal ""Lou Malnati's"" so tried this out.Delivery took an hour - no major deal but when we got our pizza, paid, tipped 20% and opened our box, our pizza looked, well.....sloppy and messy!The taste was ok, but there was too much sauce and I think the cook ended up lazily slapping it into the box since ingredients were spewed all over the box, spilling over the crust.  Our pizza was deformed!  As previously stated, the taste was fine - lukewarm but not stone cold so we can deal with that...you can't expect piping hot pizza with delivery so no complaints there.  We just wish the pizza was a bit more appealing visually and didn't look like someone threw up in the box!",7,5,negative
4035,"Loved the pizza! Good beer! And great music, country! We went here because if the amazing reviews while visiting Chicago. We went on a Tuesday night so it was surprisingly not very busy and the service was quick for deep dish! The crust, like everyone says, is amazing, especially the crispy burnt cheese part! The prices are more reasonable compared to some of the places downtown (depending on the amount of toppings you get at pequods). It was a fun place and seemed more for locals which I liked, but my dad said he still preferred the traditional giordanos, but I highly recommend trying both if in Chicago!",8,0,positive

And, WOW. We shared a pan pizza with mushroom and it was amazing! Delicious crust and sauce -- MmmMm.And there begins my love for pizza....Went back and dined in with a few friends - it took a little long for them to make the pizza, but it was worth the wait.

If you don't like it, consider cutting out your tongue because your taste buds have betrayed you.",5,0,positive
4039,"3 stars: A-OK.The perfect deep dish pizza is still our white whale. And Pequod's was the latest foray into that elusive hunt.There is a thin line between caramelization and burnt. Sometimes 30 seconds is all it takes to pass from heavenly and delicious to hellish and inedible. Every deep dish pizza Pequod's has ever made has been subject to this dangerous game of good vs. evil. Sometimes, good wins, and you have a transcendental pizza experience, complete with angels singing and strumming their harps. Other times, you want to go and smash the cook in the face with the cast iron pan they kept in the oven 30 seconds too long and burned the cheese on the crust like a Russian general scorching the earth as they retreated from Napoleon. It seems like people are trying a little too hard to make this the de-facto Chicago local deep dish pizza, but just because a restaurant has 2 locations vs 14, or doesn't have online ordering yet, or doesn't take reservations on weekend nights doesn't make it the yardstick for authentic Chicago deep dish. Hanging a Blackhawks banner, televising Bears games, or having slightly better than the swill most pizza places have on tap doesn't really have anything to do with the pizza, and honestly, I was expecting so much more from the pizza than what Pequod's delivered.It's not a true deep dish, but rather more like a Sicilian with the cheese below the sauce. Instead of a copious amount of cheese and sauce, you get a yeasty dough that is about an inch tall. This flies in the face of true deep dish. The dough is definitely not where you want the majority of your height in a deep dish pizza. You rely on the cheese and toppings/sauce layer to make up the majority of the height in cross-section view.  Overall - Was it good? Yes. It's pizza. It's kind of hard to ruin pizza, unless of course you burn it. Which inevitable will happen if you eat at Pequod's enough times. It's not a matter of ""if."" It is a matter of ""when.""Therefore, enjoy it, knowing that each time you go, you play Russian roulette with the burnt crust, and the next time might be the time you are forced to update your review with a 1-star for ruining your crust.",14,12,negative

4043,"Please don't forsake me Lou's.  I really, really like Pequod's pizza.  Yes, the caramelized crust is just plain tasty, although I want the crust to be just a bit more crispy.  Shut it you pizza-whores, I KNOW it's deep dish....but, there's no reason the crust shouldn't be a bit crispier.  The sausage was quite tasty -- do they make their own or buy it?  Hard to tell, and didn't care as I was tearing into it like a rabid dog.Fresh fresh fresh ingredients -- thank you for using fresh mushrooms and not canned.The thin crust is more like a hand tossed crust -- thinn-ish, but more bready.  Same issue - thin crust NEEDS crispiness.  Unequivocally.  Do away with the twisted edge artistic malarkey; just give it a standard edge that gets crisp on baking.  Great sauce, really, just lovely.  A bit of sweet, a bit of acid, LOTS of tomato flavor. Was there on a Saturday early evening, and they were able to accommodate our rather large party.  But, please make sure the tables don't tip over - we had the bobble-head of tables, and had to keep the beer pitchers in the center for fear of bathing in it.  One star.I really enjoyed that the owner came around and asked us (twice) how everything was....what a nice fellow, friendly, and genuinely interested in what we thought.  I'm glad Pequod's re-opened after the fire.",14,3,positive
4044,"I was really excited to bring my boyfriend here for his first time after me giving him such great reviews on this place. I told him how nice the staff were how great the environment is and best how tasty the food is.

Finally our sever came,  asked us what we wanted to eat then was about to walk off without asking if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers( which of course we'd like something to drink). The non attentive service continued until I started saying something outloud about how terrible the service was and how disappointed I was. Every other table recieved drinks and food in an orderly amount of time. After we finally got our pizza 30-45 minutes later again I had to ask for a beverage refill and water. I worked in food service for 5 years, and still work in customer service and I was extremely disappointed in the service here. I've gotten nothing but great reviews and have eaten there with friends before but never recieved such disappointing service. I don't want anything in return, I didn't ask for money off our bill, but I will no longer be returning and giving my business here again.

Salad and our waters came out quick and we ordered our pizza then... Nothing. Server didnt come back for over 30 mins. Came back finally and said 'i got caught up and forgot to take your order' no, idiot.... You took it 30 mins ago. Walks away again after she finds on her pad where she wrote it down then walked away to see if she put it in the computer. Then she didnt come back again and had another server come over to tell us she didnt put it in the computer! I undestand people make mistakes but not coming to check on your table for over 30 mins and then not owning up to your mistake is pretty crappy. We had been there over an hour now and they offered to rush our pizza... No thanks. The manager was super nice as was the other server tht got our problem dumped on her.

My host loves LOVES their pizza, and quite frankly, I've had better from a roach truck in downtown Los Angeles.They don't skimp on the toppings, that's one thing that is a positive I guess. But there is too much (bottom) crust, too much sauce, barely enough cheese, and not nearly enough flavor.We got a simple pepperoni pizza and I couldn't even taste the cheese. The crust was SO dry and bland that it almost brought me to tears. I love pizza, we're really good friends and after this experience (we got delivery) I was let down so incredibly much.If you're looking for a delicious Chicago style pizza, you're better off checking out SUPERIOR Chicago style pizza at PIZZERIA DUE. They actually put cheese on their pizza and along with a wine-sauce, it tastes AMAZING.Brutal honesty coming... I felt like pure SHIT after 2 slices of this pizza, I thought hey, maybe it gets better if you have more. WRONG.

I still thought because of the price it was going to be a watered down version of the real thing.  Boy was I wrong.  Small but awesome is what I say now.  We each orderd different styles.  I had sausage, mushroom (extra .95 additional toppings) green pepper and it was loaded with toppings and a really nice quality sausage.  Everyone at the table thougt that they ordered the best pizza and every one of us walked away with a smile and a full belly.  I did notice a few tables with a full size pizza and I have to admit that they looked unbelievable and can't wait to go back.  I have told a few people that this is now my new #1 and will be my go to pizza joint whenever I get back to town.

WORTH IT!).  I can't speak to the service because I've never dined-in because I'm a recluse when it comes to Pequod's pizza; I prefer to sit in pajamas like some dead-beat, do-nothing and fist-to-mouth 8 or 9 times the recommended serving and it just wouldn't be polite to do that in public and my parents raised me better than that, so I do it in my room with the door closed and I only cry a little.tears of exhilaration and unabated joy.These guys don't do online ordering because they're Luddites and I'm cool with that, I just always pay in cash so I'm not even sure if they take credit cards, but probably they do because that's the American way and this pizza is as American as the name Pequod.",13,6,positive
4066,"Pequod's is a must-try!  Especially if you are visiting the Chicago area, and want to sample some great Chicago-style pizza.Even if you don't generally prefer deep dish (like me), you will certainly enjoy the deep dish at Pequod's.  You'll find more info on their site, and menu, about their unique deep dish baking process.  Their deep dish takes a while to make (I think about 40 minutes), but it's well worth the wait.  The toppings are all high quality, and they're generous with the toppings.  They also have a great selection of draft beers, including several excellent local brews.And don't let the long lines turn you off.  You can pre-order your pizza when you request a table, and it'll be ready shortly after you're seated.  You'll often see the owner at the restaurant, and he is really friendly and helpful.I've sorely missed this place since I left Chicago, and make it a point to go there whenever I'm back in town.",11,1,positive

4068,"Love the thin pepperoni mushroom pizza!!! BUT, their deep dish is their specialty so if you are new to Chicago, PLEASE make sure to order the deep dish and get at least one ingredient. The service is eehhh. You feel the order-and-get-out attitude from the waitresses. I also don't blame them, because some folks stay for too long because of the games in the tv screens. For 2 folks, a small deep dish is more than enough. The slices are pretty heavy so don't order more! For bigger groups, just ask and at least this way, you won't have a lot of leftovers to carry around. The lunch special is amazing, so if you are travelling during these hours and can spare more than an hour, get the lunch special ($6 for a personal pizza with a beer/soft drink). Really good pizza so I always tell EVERYONE I know to try it.",4,1,positive
4069,"Haven't eaten in the restaurant but ordered pizza from here. Wait was a little long but we live a little trek away so it took us that time to get down there.Loved the thin crust. Deep dish was good but a bit bready for my taste. Carmelized crust runs on borderline burnt. Sauce was the winner for me. All-in-all, a sturdy place to order pizza.",3,0,positive
4070,Excellent food.  Service was good but slow. We highly recommend it.,2,1,positive
4071,"Solid deep dish. The crust is awesome, by carmelizing cheese around the periphery it takes it to a whole new level. Sauce was very good as well. Lots of flavor. We did a green pepper, sausage, onion and the secret ingredient my buddy Monte went with, fresh garlic. Solid choice. Ambiance would be best described as chill. I saw another review call it blue collar, which i wasn't too sure about. But it's just lacking any pretense or BS. In a good way. Ok selection of beers, so all in all we'll be heading back here.",6,1,positive
4072,"The reason I am giving one star is because the crust was burnt cheese but good and our server was nice but the pizza itself was uncooked doughy and disgusting. I did not like the tomato sauce on it at all.

4073,"I'm pretty easy to please with pizza but I wasn't impressed with Peaquod's.  It was edible.  To be fair we ordered the thin crust (which seemed more like a regular crust).  I see most people rave about their deep dish. The crust was very bland but the tomato pizza sauce had a distinct flavor.  The cheese kept sliding off the crust every time we took a bite or served it.  Eating this was too much work. I can't get past the bland, dense crust so I highly doubt ill try their deep dish.",6,4,negative
4074,"The spinach and garlic pizza is a revelation. Ha, ok, seriously, I've wanted to type something douchey like  that for a bit.

4075,"I am definitely a fan of this place! I am not a big pan pizza person, but a friend recommended it to me and I was not disappointed. A medium pan pizza with 3 toppings is MORE than enough (we each took 2 pieces home as left overs). We got mushrooms, onions and sausage on the pizza and it was delicious. I would recommend this place and come back any time.",4,1,positive
4076,"My husband had been to Pequod's on a previous visit to Chicago, and he could not stop raving about the pizza. On our vacation, Pequod's was at the top of his list, but he was a little worried that I would be disappointed, that no pizza could live up to his rave reviews. He was wrong! Usually you enjoy one or two aspects of a pizza. At Pequod's, every element is the best you will ever eat, and combining all these flavors left me moaning with delight. . . the gooey, stringy cheese; the carmelized crust; the sweet, spicy sausage; the fresh meaty mushrooms. The tomato sauce was so good, I asked the waitress if I could buy a jar (no).My half of the 10-inch deep dish pizza was a little too much food for me, but I ate it all anyway, knowing that until we return to Chicago I will never experience another meal like this. This meal was as delightful as our $150 meal at Blackbird.Pequod's is generally very crowded, so you might want not want to visit during mealtimes. We ate there at 3 o'clock on a Sunday. The downstairs was full, and many people were eating on the sunny (and quieter) second floor. We found street parking only a block away. Service was friendly and efficient.",12,5,positive
4077,"Think of this as pizza hut on performance enhancers.  This is not your typical Chicago deep dish...it's not stuffed and the crust is extra thick.  The pizza is a amazing...with the little carmalized cheese..whooff.  They use quality ingrediants such as fresh mushrooms as opposed to canned, big pieces of fresh made ital. suasage, etc.  reasonably priced for what you get.The delievery takes for ever.",4,0,positive
4078,"First time having deep dish so perhaps I'm not versed enough to ""get it""... there wasn't really any sauce or cheese, mostly just dough.  I thought deep dish would be smothered with cheese like in the pictures.  Oh well....",3,0,negative
4079,"Overall good experience. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Got Mozzarella sticks and deep dish pizza with sausage topping recommended by the waitress. The Mozzarella sticks was nearly perfect. The crispiness was just right, and the cheese.. oh my the cheese.. tastes so good that I could finish them even without the dipping sauce. Now the deep dish.. maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I can't say it tasted amazing. The cheese, again, was really really good, and I definitely loved the crust. But the sauce and sausage somehow lacked some 'character'. It tasted alright, but not so impressive to me. That's the main reason for 3 stars.Next time you go to the neighborhood, at least grab some Mozzarella sticks there. You won't be disappointed!",11,1,negative
4080,"On my first visit to Chicago, I tried a deep dish pizza and I have to say it wasn't the best and it scarred me until this restaurant! The deep dish pizza was amazing, filled with tons of cheesy mozzarella and amazing sauce. This pizza revived my appetite for deep dish! The carmelized crust was to die for. Overall this was amazing!I would definitely eat here the next time i'm around!",4,3,positive
4081,"I normally try to avoid deep dish pizza like the plague. But after seeing a piece about Pequod's on some late-night WGN show, we had to check it out.Their 11am-3pm lunch special is a great deal: $4.95 gets you a soda and a 7"" personal pizza with 1 topping. I, of course, chose jalapeños and was not disappointed. Not too greasy like some I've had and the crust was just the right amount of crunchy. The sauce-to-cheese ratio was perfect as well. I probably won't go back too often (after not being able to stop eating the entire 7"", I pretty much hated myself), but I'll definitely say it's one of the best deep dish pizza joints in the city.",8,3,positive
4082,"How do I put this politely without offending midwesterners?  I strongly disklike, hate is such a tough word, thick crusted pizzas.  There I said it.  To me, there's something a little unnatural about eating your pizza with a fork and knife.  Give me a NY slice that you have to fold in half and I'm a happy camper.However, with that said, Pequods is good for a pan pizza.  After hearing much hype about the food, a group of us (half who had been and half who were virgins) decided to go for lunch.  I knew what I was getting myself into, but I'm convinced that there is a Chicago style pizza place out there that will convert me from my dislike for deep dish or pan pizza.  Pequod's came close, but not enough to convert me.Pequod's has a fabulous lunch special.  For only $4.95 you get a 7"" personal pizza with one topping plus a beer or soda.  Mind you that 7"" is enough to feed 2 and for that price you really can't go wrong.  There was a great variety of toppings and everything was very tasty.  As everyone raves about the caramalized crust is quite delish, but let's be honest....it's over cooked cheese.  Overall, Pequod's to me is like a Vegas vacation - Once a year is great, but more than one trip may be a little much.",11,5,negative
4083,"We went to Pequod's for some slices before a movie. The staff was very accommodating after we told them this, and got us in and out very fast, which we appreciated. They definitely get an A+ for service. But the slices tasted pretty horrible--actually, they didn't taste like anything at all, probably some of the blandest pizza I've ever had. The fried appetizer basket was very good, though.That said, our experience besides the pizza was so pleasant that I would probably give them a try for fresh pizza. If you're going to Pequod's, definitely give the slices a miss, but let me know if the stuff right out of the oven tastes better.",9,2,negative
4084,"I don't eat pizza often, but when I do it HAS to be Pequod's. The crust is to die for and I love their sausage! For the best deep dish in Chicago you have to come here. My brother lives in Australia and literally comes straight from the airport when he visits. For the hockey fan, the bar area upstairs is fun during the games (especially when the Blackhawks are on). Delivery is a good alternative for watching the game at home.",4,1,positive
4085,"Skip hour+ waits at popular Chicago pizzerias (Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Piece) and head over to Pequod's.  I'm so often discouraged with other Chicago pizza restaurants that don't accept reservations and won't even allow call-ahead orders while you wait.  Well, Pequod's is different.  Though all good restaurants have crazy busy moments, Pequod's seems to control the crowd better than most.  There are ample tables on 2 floors of space.  I've made the 30-minute call ahead, ""please put my name down"" reservation here multiple times on weekends and rarely wait longer than 5 min.  I've also walked in on a weekday night and sat down right away.  So I'm already sold on this place without even talking about the food!  Pequod's pan pizza is why you make the visit, with its rim-crust dark charred to give it a nice crouton-like crunch.  Pizza is heavy on the sauce, but when mixed with cheese, sausage, pepperoni, veggies, etc, isn't over powering.  Don't be ambitious and order a pizza larger than your appetite.  You'll end up with 5 of 8 slices to take home (though who doesn't love leftovers?).I've tried a couple appetizers and salads, which I liked, but there's no need to order them when a huge, thick, flavorful pizza is on its way.    No complaints about the staff, service or restaurant condition.  Pequod's is a pizza gem!  Always a fun place to go with friends as I'm sure a handful of them haven't been before.  Your small or large party will leave happy they came... and full!",12,3,positive
4086,"At first when I ate Pequods, I thought wow...this is pretty good.  It was different from other pizzas because of it's crust and had good flavors, but after try Lou Malnati...IMO, Lou's is better!  Looking back the crust was kinda crispy, burnt and not what I would prefer.  Pequods seemed more doughy and made it overwhelming to eat too much of it.  Lou Malnati was simply cheesy and good..  But all in all...i'm not even a deep dish fan..so what do I know!",6,1,negative
4087,Don't order the salad.   The lettuce was not very fresh as it had a lot of brown spots and it showed its age.  Lettuce doesn't cost much and the markup on a salad is very high so to have them serve old lettuce speaks volumes.,1,0,negative
4088,"I've been here on multiple occasions and I can definitely say I am a fan. They're not my favorite game in town, but they make a good pizza none-the-less. Their signature is caramelized crust on their deep dish pizza and that's what keeps me going back. My one gripe with this place is that I feel like the bottom crust is too bready in comparison to the rest of the pie. I get around this by ordering extra cheese any time I'm there. To my tastes, it corrects the ratio.",3,1,positive
4089,"Mmmmm Pequod's.  I've visited twice and been extremely impressed on both occasions.  First time: big group, big deep-dish pizza with all kinds of veggies, boozing it up in the back.  I don't like deep-dish pizza.  A born-and-raised New Englander, I like my pizza super-thin.Unless it was made by Pequod's.  Oozy cheese caramelized on the side of the pan, rich flavors...  I still think of that pizza pie fondly, and it's been about two years.Fast forward to January 2010: my boyfriend and I stopped in to get slices to go.  Thin crust with olives and mushrooms.  The staff were incredible!  They put up with our hemming and hawing as we picked out toppings, asked for slices, then changed our minds and decided to get a large pizza instead.  Offered us a table while we waited, which was really nice--D. took the opportunity to enjoy a glass of wine--and gave us plenty of little packets of red chili flakes and parmesan to go.  I've requested the bf for a return visit for my birthday dinner.  Mmm.",8,0,positive
4090,"Very good deep dish pizza. Different than some of the others (e.g., Lou Malnati's) in that its thickness is due largely to its crust rather than being stuffed with massive amounts of cheese. I didn't feel quite as sickly full eating Peqoud's as I did eating at other famous deep dish pizza places. And, despite the thick crust, Peqoud's avoids the taste and texture of pan pizzas. Not sure how they do it. I did miss that extra cheese a little bit, but overall a great option for someone who wants deep dish pizza but does not wish to endure the typical 5 hour food coma that generally follows a Chicago-style pizza experience.",3,1,positive
4091,If you like lots of crust and bread this pizza is for you. I unfortunately love a cheesy pizza that is not 90 percent crust and only 10 percent toppings. I'm bummed out because I have heard great things about their deep dish. Thin crust was ok if I remember correctly but it was several months ago.,4,2,negative
4092,"This is probably the worst pizza I've had in Chicago-- though I've had much worse in recent memory during a day's jaunt over to Indiana that made me shudder to think about living outside a city every again. Although, perhaps I'm being harsh on Pequod's, because the problem here was one of unmet expectations. We ordered a thin crust pizza, and the waitress followed up with ""Do you want any cheesy garlic breadsticks?"". Caught off guard, we said ""Sure, ok,"" expecting something along the lines of a small breadbasket. We were instead served two long planks of garlic bread, bubbling with cheese, and marinara sauce. And everything was excellent-- good quality cheese, and the sauce! Perfection! So, naturally, we were excited to see what our actual pizza would be like......and this is where Pequod's really faltered. The pizza appeared to have nothing in common with our fantastic appetizer-- poorer quality dough, cheese, and appallingly bad sauce. Also, we ordered our pizza with bell peppers, which had been over-cooked-- that's become a pet peeve since that fated Indiana pizza *shudders*, and it could have been worse, but I really prefer them crisp. Again, it wasn't terrible, it just suffered from a lack of melding of the flavors, as though the sauce wasn't in tune with the cheese, which wasn't in tune with anything else. Considering they seem to know what they're doing in the ""bread + cheese + sauce"" department, as evidenced by our appetizer, it must be just sheer perversity that leads them to make such poor quality pizza. We will not be back, cheesy garlic bread notwithstanding.",8,11,negative
4093,"I will preface this review with having recently relocated from NYC, I have a different take on pizza than most locals here in Chicago (I know, I know...). That being said, I (of course) had their thin crust pizza- which was the best I've tried since being in Chicago. I thought they did a great job, and the atmosphere of the place was spot on. Once I finally get over the fact that I can't get Brooklyn style pizza here in Chicago, my rating will most likely move to 5 stars (just bitter!)",2,1,positive

4096,"With the glut of Chicago style pizza joints, it becomes very difficult for a place to distinguish itself let alone compete.  Most places have some signature styles, such as buttered crust, cornmeal crust, sausage patty, cheesy crust, etc. Pequod's is able to stand out by sticking to simplicity and just straightforward good quality that makes a neighborhood joint so enjoyable.  Their deep dish has a wonderful sauce, probably of which is the best I have ever tasted.  It has a depth and richness that scream homemade and undoubtedly has had a great deal of attention and time behind it.  Their meatballs are fantastically delicious and is something that I would put into my Lucky Charms cereal every morning if I could.  If they had a signature style, I would say that it is the caramelization that their dough undergoes around the uppermost edges from the pan itself.  Some may consider it burnt, but I enjoyed its additional flavor and crunchiness.  Sausage topping was nice and had enough of the spices and seasoning that makes homemade Italian sausage so enjoyable.I noticed that many of the tables were ordering the hand tossed, which looked good as well.  I was not able to try any, but if the table next to us had left any behind, my ghetto instincts would have forced me to take a slice.",14,5,positive
4097,"With our usual good foresight, we decided to head to Piece Pizza during the recent Wicker Park Street festival.  Turning onto North off of Ashland we noticed people were walking faster than we were driving, and decided to reroute our pizza choice to another- Pequods.  Being a Sunday night we assumed we would be seated rather quickly, but Pequods being Pequods, there was a wait.  We were told 35-40 minutes, which was spot-on.  It was also nice that we were given a menu to pre-order so once seated we would have a limited wait for our food.  Once seated, we ordered an appetizer and began our wait.  I really liked the simple atmosphere of Pequod's.  The bar is pretty centrally located in the eating area, but it is relatively bright and cozy.  The restaurant was actually pretty quiet and the whole place kind of reminded me of a pizzeria in Northern WI I would go to with my family after a day of fishing.  The salad and cheesy garlic bread we ordered were fine, mostly just tasty bites to tide us over in our wait for the main event.The pizza was awesome.  I agree with others assessments that the amount of cheese is less than some other pan pizza joints, but  I preferred it.  The cheese tasted less rubbery and more gooey goodness.  The sauce was also great with a tinge of sweetness.  Finally, the sausage on top was ample and delicious.... It really makes me rethink my use of turkey sausage in everything at home.  We ordered a medium, and were only able to eat 1 piece each (2 people) so we took lots of pizza home- a treat for the rest of the week.  I just really loved this place.",19,1,positive

Exposed brick, subdued lighting, cool feel. Both my husband and I had already ordered drinks from the bar and perused the menu so our order was very quick.The service was not. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer of cheesey garlic bread to come out, I've made cheesy garlic bread on my pizzaz at home quicker.5 minutes later our pizza came out, burnt on the edges might I add. I will say that the parts of the pizza that weren't scorched were good. Not out of this world, but decent. This where our previous server disappeared. We were given the check almost immediately after receiving our food, even though my beer was full and husbands was empty. We have both worked in the restaurant/bar industry for several years.

I liked the fact that they used massive chunks of toppings. You could tell that that  they were fresh and it was a very hearty pizza. Other than that, the pizza was nothing all that wonderful. It was almost rather bland and the sauce did not have all that much flavor. Will we be back here? Possibly if we are in the area or if we have a coupon. This place did nothing to overwhelm me.

Imagine our surprise when we found that Pequod's is not only nice inside, it is ENORMOUS!The menu is simple and straightforward. You can tell that pizza is their specialty. Why bother with a large extravagant menu when you can instead concentrating on perfecting one dish? That's not to say there weren't appetizers/sides on the menu, because there were. We just elected to ignore them.The pizza was absolutely PHENOMENAL! We stuck to a simple, large pepperoni pizza. It was one of the best pizza's I have had since moving to Chicago 3 years ago. The large pizza (thin crust) was easily enough for 4 or 5 people. The best highlight of the evening was when the bill arrived.

4117,"I was told by a local hipster that this place is way better than Lou Malnati's because it's much less ""corporate""...Whatever that means.  Not wanting to seem unenlightened, I just nodded in agreement and decided to try it out.  The caramelized cheese crust was good on the first piece.  However, I found the sauce to be somewhat watery, which caused the crust to be soggy on subsequent pieces.  I am not a person who only likes pizza from one place and the rest suck, it's not the Cubs and Sox debate.  I don't think I've had a bad Chicago Deep Dish; some are just better than others.  I would rank Pequod's among the best, but not better than Lou's.  Maybe ""corporate"" is the secret ingredient.",6,2,positive
4118,"Great pan pizza. The cheesy crunchy crust is fantastic, sausage tasty with spices. Ordered take-out on a weekday evening, had to wait a little while for the pizza to be ready, though I think I arrived too quick so that's on me, but it's fine on the inside - TVs, lots of people looking happy with their food, and not too crowded.",4,2,positive
4119,"I went here for lunch and it was just ok for me.  Lou Malnati's is my favorite pizza but I decided to give Pequod's a try after reading the reviews.  The lunch special is a great deal but I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  First of all, the drinks we had tasted weird.  I don't know if it was the ice, the cups, or the fountain gun, but something just made the coke taste kinda dirty.  The pizza was good but not great.  It really is more like Pizza Hut pan pizza than Chicago style pizza.  So if you prefer a more pan style with a lot of bread then you'd probably enjoy this.",8,2,negative
4120,"Chicago deep dish is awesome, but for me its a rare treat since you know...it's packed with cheese.  When I do eat pizza, I try to go out of my way to go to Pequods.  Its not your typical deep dish, rather a pan style with some decent toppings.  The crust is amazing and its just awesome.  It's between Bacino's and Pequod's for me.",4,0,positive
4121,"I am clearly in the minority, but I don't think Pequods is that good. To pick up 2 pizzas we left one hour and still had to wait 20 min once we got there. Was it worth it, no. The biggest complaint was too much bread to the crust. The deep dish has a good inch of bread under it, and one slice is incredibly filling because of it. The price is high, too!",5,1,negative
4122,This place was really good. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. I was on a road trip with some friends and we stopped in Chicago. We ate at this place. The toppings were really good. We had a pan pizza with sausage. The caramelized crust was really good. I approve of Chicago pizza.,5,0,positive
4123,"MMMMM sweet sasafrass this pizza is damn good!!!!  Good bless Pequods.  I really do love pizza (who doesn't really, maybe people who like to kick puppies)....and Pequods is fan-freaking-tastic.  To each his/her own, and I know not everyone loves this place, but I know FAR more people that do love Pequods and drool at the though of it as I do.  I typically order just a basic pepperoni pizza and find myself drifting off into a happy  place as I eat it....oozing with cheesy gooeyness, just the right kind of crust with the right thickness.  5 Stars.",10,2,positive
4124,"I heard many a great thing about Pequod""s, and thankfully they were all true.This place has the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, and probably will ever have. The pies are deep, but not too much. They're just right! The toppings are plentiful and thick and the way the cheese and crust bake around the sides will make you salivate or you don't have a pulse. The portions depend on how much you order. Most would say a small will feed two. Not in this city, babe! Unbuckle those pants and order up a medium or larger!The service was friendly for a place so crowded and popular. Folks from joints like Great Lake should take note; this place is succeeding where you are failing.Pequod's is certifiably good, Yelpers! Don't hesitate; grab a group for fun or sit alone and lament into food that will stop you from jumping into traffic.",10,1,positive
4125,"Wow, really people? I ordered this pizza based on great reviews on Yelp. Where are you people coming from? This is the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life! The deep dish pizza has 1 inch of dough with a little bit of sauce and meat on top. The sauce was like tomato paste out of a can! No cheese to speak of except for the burnt cheese on the edge of the crust. Horrible! Got it delivered and it took more than 11/2 hrs. They said 1 hour. No thank you! Lou Malnatti's is still the best!",5,1,negative
4126,"Great value for the lunch special!  Pizza was ok, after looking through the reviews and pictures I thought it would be a bt more like an old school style Pizza Hut pizza,  pizza dough was very bready, and I thought there could have been more cheese.",1,0,negative
4127,"Great pizza. You may have to wait a while for a table on the weekends but it is well worth it. They usually have a couple decent beers on tap as well. I would pick Pequods over Lou's, Geno's Uno, etc every time.Wouldn't change a thing about this place.",4,0,positive
4128,My first time in Chicago and first thing I had to try was authentic deep dish pizza. I was not disappointed. The crust was airy and crunchy and the sauce was delicious. We waited about 20 minutes for the pizza to come out but I was told that it was to be expected since they make them to order.,2,1,positive
4129,Review for the thin crust. If you consider hand toss pizza thin crust then you should be good. I love crispy cracker thin ... this was not it. I had a bite of the deep dish and it was ok ... not a huge deep dish fan ... just so much bread.,2,0,negative
4130,"This is the best tasting thing that has ever been delivered to my home.  It is the best tasting deep dish I've ever had.  The burnt cheese crust is mind blowingly good.  I work out five times a week and would happily bump it to seven if I needed to eat this every day.  Order it now.  Get the sausage.  I am 90% vegetarian, but the sausage changes all that.I seriously don't think I will ever order deep dish from another place if this is an option.  Dying to try Spacca Napoli next!",5,1,positive
4131,"Great pizza with a less than desirable crouton crust.  If you're going unhealthy, you might as well go all the way and order some hot wings too.  The wings had a great crust, but was lacking that roundhouse kick to the face flavor.  It was merely good.  We ordered the deep dish sausage with the caramelized crust.  They actually topped it with real Italian sausage chunks, not like the wimpy M&M sized ones from Domino's.  Plenty of cheese, good tasting tomato sauce, and great tasting outer caramelized crust.  When I bit into the bottom crust, it felt like I was biting into chalk.  It was dry and lacked flavor.  I could've probably broken it into pieces and replaced it for croutons on top of a Caesar salad.""Best Pizza in the Universe"".  I guess it depends on what your definition of ""universe"" is.",10,4,negative
4132,"Go here, it's that simple.  Go here and order the pan pizza and love it.  Come back and order the awesome sandwiches.  If you can't love a place like this, you may not be capable of love; use that as a measuring stick for your emotional breadth in life.",6,0,positive
4133,"Yummy!  Oh my goodness I wish we could have it a pie delivered out to California so we could have it again.   By far the best deep dish in Chicago, and trust me while we where here we were on the deep dish pizza diet.  Very Very poor service from our waitress but couldn't let that effect my taste buds. Amazing, phenomenal pizza!",4,0,positive
4134,"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!First found out about this place about 1-2 years ago when i was hanging out with some cast members from Second City.  They recommended it and then my GF and I decided to go there one late night since they open til like 2am or something like that.  Frickin good pizza.    Have ordered a pizza from there from where i live, which is Lombard,  and it was worth the drive.  Yum.My friends and I always order pizza from here whenever we feel like some pie whenever we are in the city.  My last visit i also tried their cookies, that stuff is good too, big and tasty (that's what she said).  Anyway this place is great.  Love it Love it Mahal.",8,0,positive
4135,"I say...3.5 stars, but I'll round up b/c This place is yummy in da tummy.  I can see why it's a hit or miss among pizza lovers - but really, when it comes down to the perfect pie - it's more about preference...BUT i will tell you this...I am a thin crust lover...and I go gaga over the deep dish here.The crust will come out and look all burnt up, but it's so tasty and crunchy and adds that perfect punch to go along with the rest of the pie....mmmm goodness.  My only gripe is that beer is so damn expensive.  I supp I can always JUST get pizza here, but that's no fun...that would be like mac with no cheese...well, for me anyway =p  So I shall deem this as an ""occasion"" spot like a chill date night before a movie...well, that what we do anyway...but go on and do it too...can't go wrong!",9,5,positive
4136,As you can read this place has a fantastic pizza. There are enough reviews to hammer that home already. A place really has to go above and beyond to earn the perfect 5 star rating from me. Let me just say it: $4.95 for a personal deep dish pizza AND pint of beer at lunch time!  Ermahgerd! Amazing!,3,0,positive
4137,"Go to Pequod's.  Today, this weekend, this month - no excuses.  Don't wait any longer.  Their deep dish pizza is to die for.  It might be the best in the city.  The sides of the crust are crunchy goodness.  The bottom crust is firm and can hold the mound of toppings.  We had a large deep dish with green olives, pepperoni, and giardiniera.  Oh my goodness.  Go here soon!!!And their wings - so tasty.  They aren't buffalo style, but are spicy and have a unique flavor.  If you do not devour them, my guess is that you are feeling sick, and therefore your hunger is impaired.  You know how it goes if you have the flu or another similar illness.And it is open late too!",3,4,positive
4138,"It is hard to remember being so disappointed. Eating pizza at all the awesome places in this city we had always said, ""And soon we'll eat Pequod's and it will be life changing good!"". It's always on top lists and I just saw it today on Eater's 38 essential  Chicago restaurants. I ordered a large deep dish to surprise my husband with two weeks ago and we were both so excited. No flavor. Seriously, no flavor. I had to put salt and pepper all over this thing just to taste something. I can't remember that much cheese ever being so unsatisfying before. And the mushrooms were just like water. When is one slice all that I want?? It was such a waste. The crust was good and I can see why people like that but I just feel like I was robbed because I ate bad pizza in Chicago. I could have gone anywhere else, even  Pizza Hut and enjoyed my pizza more because this was that bad. Give me thin crust at Spacca Napoli or deep dish at Exchequer any day over this.",9,5,negative
4139,"I'm not really sure what's going on here, but, man have things changed. I LOVE Pequods pizza and have been coming here for I can't remember how long. The pizza hasn't changed, but the service sure has.  We had some out of town guests for the holidays who were really excited to have some great chicago pizza. We chose Pequods over all the other more commercial places.  On Monday night there was an hour -hour & half wait. FOR PIZZA! On Monday? Huh? We were rudely asked if we bothered to call before hand. Again... For pizza on a Monday? Since when was that necessary and why so rude? A couple after us, I guess, did call earlier and were still drilled about how early they called. What's the deal with this?  We decided to go elsewhere with our guests. Yes, to a more commercial place. We still were told there would be a 45min wait. But, we were also offered to put our order in early so when out table was ready, our pizza would be ready faster & we were politely told about the bar next door, in case we wanted to get drinks and hang out more comfortably while waiting. They called us when out table was ready & we had some yummy pizza.  Pequods, your product is solid, but you have some work to do on your customer service.",9,3,negative
4140,"It almost feels like a waste for me to add another review of this place... I would list all the same delicious things as everybody else who enjoys it, the crust above all else.  I love that they deliver (even though it's much tastier in the restaurant than after riding in a box for 20 or 30 minutes) and that they'll do half toppings, so I can split an enormous small with a meat eating friend.I think I could eat pizza every day and not get get tired of it, and if I ever were to undertake such an endeavor, Pequod's would definitely contribute.",4,3,positive

4142,"I'm not particularly a fan of pan pizza, but I LOVE Pequod's.  I actually like their thin crust pizza better, particularly because of the delicious crust that doesn't overwhelm the ingredients, which, for me, are why you get pizza (not a crust fan).  The cheese is perfectly brown and delicious.  The sauce is fresh and light.  I just noticed now on their menu that it says ""The Best Pizza in the Universe.""  I'm not sure whether they got that from me, but that is really what I tell everyone who asks me where to go for pizza in Chicago.  I say you have to go to Pequod's because it is the best pizza in the Universe.  Sadly, I only get to enjoy it once or twice a year, now that I have moved to the pizza wasteland that is Houston, TX.",8,0,positive

My husband brought me here 3 years ago, and I'm sorry to say, that after giving it a second chance - I was as disappointed today, as I was then. Seriously bad pizza. I have absolutely no idea why the good reviews. The pan pizza (we had both times) is all bread and very, very little cheese...and waaaaaay too much mediocre sauce. Good ambiance, but that's no reason to go anywhere to eat. Bad, bad, bad. Bad, bad.",1,6,negative
4144,"Made a reservation at Pequod's for my birthday and the staff was more than accomdating for all 15 of us.  The pizzas took a while to come out, and they actually forgot to put in our one thin crust we ordered...but absolutely well worth the wait and they took off 50% of the pizza they forgot about...I actually almost forgot the negative experience because I enjoyed the food so much.As for the pizza, it's amazing...from the crispy, caramalized cheese crust to the delicious sauce and endless toppings..it's perfection on a plate. The pizza differs from Lou's or a Gino's, which is much appreciated! It was so refreshing to find a place like this, and not too far away. I will gladly return again and again!",10,0,positive
4145,"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago, hands down.  As a Chicagoan I'm well aware of the fact that everyone's favorite pizza place is the best and to say otherwise is fighting words, but Peqod's pizza is really spectacular.  I am a regular fixture at the restaurant, eating there on almost a weekly basis, and the food is consistently good.  The best part is of course their trademark caramelized crust.  I've only ordered the pizza delivery a few times and can say that while its still good, you're much better off going to the restaurant and eating it fresh from the oven.  Like most deep dish it will fill you up quickly and a small is more then enough for two people.   After a kitchen fire a few years ago the interior of the restaurant got a revamp, so it no longer has the classic Chicago pizza parlor feel, but the atmosphere is still nice, and the restaurant is clean.  The restaurant is deceptively large with a second story with a full service bar, though I personally prefer eating on the ground floor.  The wait staff has all been working there for years and is friendly and courteous.  Service is also always prompt with multiple servers and staff members taking care of you during your meal.",18,1,positive

4149,"I'll start out by saying that I had Pequod's delivery instead of in situ. Hey--it's freakin' cold outside! The pizza arrived warm and still caramelized at the edges, the salad was well-chilled, and the garlic cheese bread arrived toasty.Working from most disappointing to favorite part of the meal, here goes:The garlic cheese bread was cheesy, but at two pieces, it didn't seem like much. I also could not taste any garlic at all. Out in the 'burbs, if you order garlic at most restaurants, you don't have to search for it in the food. Dunno if the city was misnamed a long time ago, but ""place of the wild garlic"" doesn't apply to most restaurants recipes downtown.The Pequod salad was very large (definitely enough for two people to share as a dinner salad). I don't usually like a lot of vegetables, but the dressing was just enough to mostly hide the flavor of the black olives from my tongue.There was plenty of pepperoni on top, and everything blended together well as far as taste.The pizza was tempting looking as it was thick, juicy, and covered with pepperoni as well. Couldn't even see the other ingredients (sausage and garlic). Now this time, Pequods did not disappoint with the garlic. It was visible, and could be tasted too. I would've preferred a little more, as the sauce is a bit sweet. Not too sweet, as some reviews state. The dough was just about the right thickness and consistency for a deep-ish dish pizza, and there was plenty of each of the ingredients. I didn't taste the caramelized edge as I was expecting...maybe it's an acquired taste, but I just didn't see it as a big plus. It added some flavor, but it was just kinda' crunchy and burnt...but then again, I like my toasted marshmallows golden, warm, and gooey, not black and flavorless. To each his own taste! (Or ""Chacun de son gout,"" as the French would say.)All in all, a pretty good place for delivery. I think it would probably be even better brought warm and fresh right to your table from the oven, since the delivery took about an hour in the winter weather. If the result was this good, I can only imagine it to be better at Pequods proper.",25,5,positive
4150,OMG!! Absolutely delicious! Best Chicago style pizza EVER! This was my first time having a Chicago style pizza but I was with some experts on the subject and even they agreed it was the best they'd ever had. They had already had pizza four times this trip. Hands down a real find. This will always be a stop when in Chicago. Can't wait to go again.,2,0,positive
4151,First time trying the pizza. Got it delivered to our hotel room which took 90 minutes but was well worth the wait and the pizza arrived still hot. Thought the pizza was burnt at first but once I tasted the crust I realized it was caramelized which is what kicks this whole thing up a notch for me. It already has me thinking about when I can go back to Chicago and get more! Man I am jealous of my former self just thinking about it!,3,0,positive

4153,"Dear Pequod's - You have just lost our business forever! ~ Also I will be posting this review on Facebook so all of my friends can read about your terrible business practice as well..We have just moved to a new apartment in the city last month and we called what ""used to be"" our favorite pizza place to see if they deliver to our new neighborhood. YES! They do, they tell us! ""Awesome!!"" - Send over a pizza we say! Great, they say. It'll take about and hour and a half they say. ""Sounds good"" we say...........We wait......We wait........We wait........ We wait.......Pizza never shows up...............We call them about two hours later.  They tell us they gave our pizza away! Uhhh, Whut? YES THEY GAVE OUR PIZZA AWAY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY DO NOT DELIVER TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!!!!  I guess this goes without saying but they could have told us that at the time the order was placed instead of just blowing us off and GIVING our pizza away!!! Turns out or house is two blocks from their delivery border. I guess they could have also called us after the fact to let us know.  Nope - Nothing of the sort happened. I have completely lost faith in this business. When we called them to find out what was up with our order, they we're even rude to us over the phone!  How is this even acceptable in this era of Yelp, Facebook, Etc????? Do NOT give this place your business! P.S. I literally wrote this review with a tear running down my cheek. Iused to love this place. Sadly is has fallen by the wayside. I had seen this coming. Management and staff seem to be perpetually stoned/drunk and they no longer give a shit about customers.  So sad......Best of luck to you Pequod's..Buhbye!",5,5,negative

It took a while to get done and was oozing with cheese when it did. The crust was nice and spongy as i suppose its meant to be. Once again declaring the fact that im not the biggest fan of this style of pizza i have to say that i wasn't that blown away. My friend who is a less fussy seemed to really like it though so maybe you'd like it if you love deep dish.,6,2,negative
4159,I'm a pizza lover so my friend suggested his fav spot he raved about the caramelization of the crust which I found out was code for burnt cheese. We walk in and the space can get crowded no different from other popular pizza joints seems like that's standard in Chicago the standing room can get quite crowded....and for an agoraphobe such as myself it took a lot to be there waiting on our table but a spot at the bar gave me some room. So the hostesses (mainly 1 of 3) at the front were kind of not very polite. They kind of stared at us when we walked in and didn't eeh greet us very politely. I did give her the side eye because I was a hostess at Unos and my firsts always were greeted with a welcome and a smile. I actually was going to leave just because of that but decided to stay as we drove all the way here for this pizza. But honestly it really did bug me. Anyhow the wait time is about 50 minutes again standard for Chicago pizza. We ordered the pan pizza with pepperoni sausage and some veggies but it was way too salty. We thought maybe with the meats it was overall yes but my friend assured me that he's had this pizza before and it has never tasted like this. It wasn't bad just too salty for my taste. Anyhow the service at the bar was great and our server was awesome.,10,4,positive
4160,"I've lived in Chicago for 6 years and for some reason had never gone to Pequods. It actually wasn't until recently that I realized how popular this joint was. I'm not a big deep dish fan, but I was excited to try their pan pizza. Off the bat, I really liked the vibe of this place. It had a chill sports bar kind of vibe, with no frills and great beers on tap. I was tempted to have an Oktoberfest on draft, but I didn't want to fill up my stomach with anything other than delicious pizza. We waited about 15 minutes for a table and were seated the second our pager went off. We split a ceasar salad as an appetizer and got a medium pan pizza with mushrooms, spinach, pepperoni, and sausage. I loved it! I loved that the crust wasn't paper thin like a lot of Chicago pizza's, but also wasn't crazy deep dish. We gorged and still had room for leftovers (which I obviously ate for breakfast the next day). Great spot! Little bit of a wait, but definitely worth it.",9,3,positive
4161,This is the best pizza west of the Raritan River. While visiting Chicago I had the pan pizza and the thin crust. The pan was a cheese pizza and the thin crust had the best sausage I had tasted on a pizza in years. I believe this is due to the fact that they only use quality ingredients at this restaurant. I also heard that they are on a pizza tour of Chicago. Thank you!,2,0,positive
4162,"Having recently moved to Chicago, I was feeling the need to take a break from the chaos of combining two households into one. Not wanting to cook or go out, we decided to order some comfort food. For me, this was nothing fancy - just a plain cheese pizza, well-done.When I opened the box, I saw a round pizza cut into squares, covered in a thick, impenetrable layer of grease. While I can't take points off for the cutting nonsense (save it for the Sicilian pies), I definitely can justify the low rating by saying it was the single most unappetizing pizza I have ever seen. Honestly, did someone pour french fry grease ONTO the pizza? It was nauseating. Because we had no food, after pulling off the cheese and using about a half a roll of paper towels to soak up the remaining grease, I did eat a couple of the squares. It was mediocre.Perhaps it's something I need to get used to, but I like round pizza to come in slices, not squares. I like my pizza to be edible, not soggy and wet. I like my pizza to have a delicious crust, not blackened.Maybe they were having an off night, maybe it was somebody new...but how can a pizza joint not know how to make a plain cheese? As a teenager I worked in a pizza place and during our down time we used to concoct some pretty wild creations, but this slimy pie beats our worst idea by a mile. Come on.",8,4,negative
4163,This was probably one of my favorite deep dish spots in chicago that i visited.

4165,"Not the biggest fan of deep dish, but when the guests are in town they all ask for ""real Chicago deep dish"" being a good host I decided that we would try some different places that I heard of around the city. Pequod's was on the list and I was completely shocked at how much I liked it. I thought Art of Pizza was pretty good, but this is my new go to deep dish spot when people come into town. I don't know what it was...it was that there wasn't a ton of cheese, and don't get me wrong I LOVE CHEESE, but usually I feel like there is too much cheese in deep dish pizza. The sauce was perfectly flavored. The part that hooks you forever though is the crust. The dough itself is a good flavor, not too buttery or overpowering but its really the cheese melted onto the side of the pan that has become one with the dough. Its a marriage made in heaven. Talking about it right now makes me want to go to Pequod's for the 3rd time in a week...is that gross? Yes, but you have to try this crust before you judge.  Also, the wings are great too! Definitely get the wings, they are a little spicy and a whole lot of perfect.  They're a great appetizer if you can't wait for your pizza.",12,3,positive
4166,"What happened to you Pequods????  We moved back to Chicago in March of 07 and started our quest for the best pizza in the city.  We mostly lived in the burbs before really.  Our friend took us to Pequods and said to be prepared to be amazed - and we were!  Love the tasty pan pizza with the burnt cheese!!!!  We told people many times that it was a contender for our favorite in the city.  Dined in another 1-2 times in 07-08.But then we ordered delivery in 2009... wow, is this the same pizza?  There is SO MUCH DOUGH and it is dry. The sauce is still tasty, but very thin, and the burnt cheese still rules. But I could hardly eat it because of the dough.  I don't want to have to pick my toppings off a pizza, that is not a good pizza.So, we thought maybe since it was delivery it just wasn't the same or just a fluke one time. I had a girls movie night last night and they all wanted to order Pequods.  We got 2 pan and 1 thin (since I hadn't tried thin yet).  Me and another friend ended up eating only the top half of our pan pieces and the crust - again - way to much dry dough!  It just isn't cutting it. Maybe they changed the recipe?  The thin was good, but not really thin - I would say it was ""normal"" thickness, and maybe more of what the pan pizza should be, just add the burnt crust to the thin pizza and it would be better I think.Well, that all being said, Pequods went from one of our favorites, to one that we won't be ordering again.  Sad.  I'll miss that big whale with undies on his head!",8,0,negative
4167,I was not all that impressed with Peaquod's.  Its OK but only really OK.  The caramelized crust is good but not amazing.  I don't really like the sausage they use (flavorless and put on in big globs on top). It does have a decent laid back old school neighborhood bar vibe.  I had recently been to Buddy's in Detroit which absolutely kills this place and that might be part of my disappointment.  Does Detroit really crush us in deep dish?  WTF?!,6,2,negative
4168,"Ahhh Chicago Tourist. I was once in your shoes. I'm only in Chicago for (insert amount of time), and I've heard about Chicago having good pizza. Tonight, we're getting deep dish. I envy you. You get to try Pequod's Pizza for the first time. I remember the first day I had it on a rainy day in June after driving and moving all day. That day began my quest (shared by many other Chicagoans) to find the best the city has to offer. I set the bar too high this first day, and have spent every pizza experience at some other place wishing I went with my gut feeling to order Pequods.It is the best pizza I have ever had, and I love it. I can't say the word Pequods as a suggestion. Once the word is uttered, it is happening.  I am sure I have spent $1000's at Pequods. I have no regrets. Sean is the manager and is almost always there. He is customer service embodied. In all of my experiences, I have had a few negative delivery experiences, and Sean has made up for them without blinking an eye. Also it has THE best lunch special in the city. For less than $6 (not including tip...don't be cheap) you get the personal deep dish pizza and a beer or soda. You must do this.So go forth Chicago newcomers, and enjoy.",7,2,positive
4169,As much as I like the pizza I will not order it again due to the consistently bad service.  Last time I called to order delivery they told me it would be a long wait.  Before I could tell them I would just come pick it up the receptionist hung up on me.  Too many other good options in Chicago to put up with the poor service.,3,2,negative
4170,Pequod's is the best of the best of Chicago Deep Dish.  I've lived in Chicago for over 25 years and used to have Lou Malnati's and Georgio's Pizza has my #1's.  Pequods takes the crown with their incrediblely fresh ingrediants.  The vegtables are hand cut and  the perfectly seasoned italian sausage is out of this world!  Lady's and Gentleman we haven't even got to their crust.  They have a Italian seasoned cheese halo crust which provides a similar crispyness as a buttercrust but this adds a bit more flavor.  I've had Pequods for both dining in and takeout and both were great!,7,0,positive
4171,"I have to say this place was a total disappointment.   We called ahead at about 5 on a Saturday night to see what the wait was.  They told me 45 minutes but that they would put my name down so we were already in line.  When we got there, 20 minutes later, I was told it would be another 45 minutes.   Stupidly, we agreed to wait the extra 20 minutes.   When we were finally seated, our server told us the wait would be an hour for pizza.   So we put our order in immediately since now they kind of had us stuck at 630  on a Saturday night.  After waiting an hour and a half, my party agreed we would just leave.  Since we hadn't seen our server in half an hour, we walked down to the hostess station.  They managed to catch my dad and tried to charge him for a pizza we didn't  even get.  I spoke with the manager after this since they were essentially trying to trick my dad into paying for something we didn't even receive.  After speaking with him and explaining our disappointing evening, he tried to make it right.   He told us he would get us a pizza right away.  I asked why it took us trying to leave to get our pizza.  He tried to make it right by comping our appetizer and  drinks and sent us home with a pizza.  That is the only reason I gave 2 stars.  The pizza was not very good and the service was awful.   The manager tried to make it up to us, but that was after our evening was already ruined.  Would never go back.",4,6,negative
4172,"Dubbed as some of the Best Pizza in Chicago, Pequod's may be considered in a class of its own.  Unfortunately, this class is not deep-dish... but rather pan-style pizza.  Besides the pan-style pizza, they are famous for their ""caramelized crust"" (see description below).  In a city with one-of-a-kind deep dish pizza, it is hard for other places to get established, but Pequod's did just that.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very ""bar-like."" It is definitely a place to check out... but definitely try it out after going to all the deep dish places.  (I did carry-out so I can't comment on the wait or the staffing).",1,1,negative

4175,"I'd give this place many more stars, but I only enjoy their food when I can get it.  I just can't grasp why the ""delivery area"" changes.  I have ordered from them before and they have delivered, when I call they ask if this is my name and my address because I have ordered from them before.  I called Sunday night, spoke with whomever picked up the phone (putting me on hold without putting me on hold).  So now I can hear everyone talking in the back, and people saying I don't see why we wouldn't deliver there.  Now a manager gets on the phone and tells me, sorry we can't deliver to you.  Why? I've been delivered to before.  Because we have to keep our customers happy....??? Wait what? I am calling just to talk and see how your Sunday night is going?  Nope... I am calling for PIZZA!!! So when I said I wouldn't ever order from them again, guess what?  The woman manager said OK.  Guess you guys must pride yourself on customer service....

Seems like someone was a little grumpy that they didn't have a Valentine's . Stupid ass waiter went to refill my boyfriend's coke and didn't arrive till 7 minutes later and left it on an empty table diagonal from ours and walked away (wtf lol?). I was so fed up that I was just going to walk over there and grab it from the table. We ordered a deep dish pizza and it took more than an hour to arrive. Come on now, there's barely anybody here, it does not take THAT long to push out a pizza. Then the dumbass waiter didn't know how to cut my pizza and gave me the most tiny sliver of a pizza, said ""woops"" and walked away. Pizza wasn't even that good, I'm sure that there's a much better pizza place than this dirty dump. Overall, it was a bad experience and will never be ordering from them again. Oh and they gave everyone who ate there a rose while they were leaving, but they didn't give us one. Talk about customer service.",3,7,negative
4179,"Really good pizza.  We started with a (very deep-fried) appetizer combo and then two small deep dish:  a garlic, basil, pepperoni and a sausage, mushroom and green olive. Very good and plenty for 4 people (two of whom are know for their ability to tuck away the pizza).I'm not going to weigh in on some kind of ""best chicago style pizza"" debate, but it really hit the spot.  The ambiance was also very pleasant and the server was attentive.  Five stars in the cosmic scheme of things?  No.  Five stars in the universe of pizza joints?  Absolutely.Parking absolutely sucks.",5,1,positive
4180,"I'm kind of embarrassed to say as a New Yorker that I've found my favorite pizza place in Chicago.Their crust is amazing.

The appetizers were ordered were pretty forgettable - in fact, I don't even remember what we got. Just come here for the pizza.I came here with a group of more than 10 people and they were pretty accommodating. At first they tried to squish us into some tables put together, but then moved us upstairs where there was more space. Overall, the service was pretty good. So to sum up: good service, amazing pizza.",9,0,positive
4181,"Quite simply, I really don't care for Chicago's deep dish (being a NYC transplant and all), but - gasp - I actually enjoyed it at Pequod's tonight.  It mainly came down to the following: 1) not as doughy as all those ""famous"" chains, 2) no disgusting amount of cheese like those ""famous"" chains, 3) excellent sauce with a hint of smokey flavor, 4) caramelized edge (which I hadn't seen at those ""famous"" chains).  A sub-par beer list, however.  My avid beer enthusiast friend was rather disappointed with his choices of beers throughout the meal.  Next time, I shall try the thin crust and see how it compares to my beloved NY pie.",9,4,positive
4182,This is some of the best pizza I have encountered in Chicago ( and I live 1 block from most all of them). I ordered normal crust (which was amazing) light and a perfect blend of crisp yet soft.

4191,"i've heard so many good things about Pequod's and their pizza so i had to finally try it. i ordered delivery from here mid afternoon on a Thursday...the girl that answered the phone was very nice but put me on hold twice while taking my order, once was in the middle of giving my credit card number and i could hear the phones ringing non-stop in the back round. it bothered me a little but i let it go bc i was so hungry and excited to try their pizza.when the delivery guy came he said he forgot to print a receipt for me to sign so i didn't have anywhere to give him a tip since i paid with credit and didn't have cash. i let him know i would call Pequod's and have them add it to my card. so after eating their delicious pan (deep dish) pizza with extra cheese and spinach, i decided to call. the first time they answered with ""Pequod's please hold"" and immediately put me on hold without my response, i waited 3 minutes then hung up. i called back and the exact same thing happened again so i hung up again. i tried one more time and as soon as they answered i asked for a manager. i was put on hold again for a few more minutes before he answered. when he answered i started by letting him know that i ordered a pizza from them and it was delicious, and also that i needed to add a tip for my delivery guy since he didn't bring me a slip to write on. after that i said i also wanted to comment on how i was put on hold a couple times during placing my order and also when i had called back a few times. i said if i had not already ordered with them i would've hung up and called somewhere else after waiting that long. i also mentioned that i felt it was not good business to cut me short and answer the phone during my order-i believe they should have taken my order and let the phone ring until we finished (they probably put those people on hold anyway!) he apologized and said he could see how that would happen since it's so busy and they only have one person answering the phone. i can understand that businesses get busy and need to put people on hold, but i did not appreciate being put on hold very abruptly and also during giving my credit card number and just wanted to give them some feedback on how that can be unnerving for someone. i hope they took it into consideration.all in all. i would order from them again since the pizza was so good, but hope they can hire another person to answer the phones!",8,6,negative

I explained that if I need to eat pizza with a knife and fork, the concept of pizza was lost. Although I did get very full from just one slice. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. The beer cold and refreshing. The pizza fantastic. The price is right.

We arrived at the place, and judging from the décor outside, I wasn't expecting very much. I assumed this was just another pizza joint. We got there around 7:30 and we were a little surprised to see there was a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes, and this was on a Sunday night), but we were able to place our order. Considering the deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes to make, the timing would be pretty good. Anyways, we sat down, drank some beers and soon the food arrived. When I first set eyes on our sausage/pepperoni pizza, I instantly could tell this was no ordinary pizza. The pizza was littered with sausage and pepperoni, mixed in with a rich color of pizza sauce. I took my first bite and the pizza was just delicious. The crust to pizza sauce/topping was perfect; there wasn't too much crust. And best of all, the caramelized crust was amazing. I've never had caramelized crust before and I was just taken aback at how good it was.No other pizza place that I've eaten at before even compares to Pequods.

It felt like a sports bar.  We split three pizzas.  The one I tried was a deep dish pizza with vegetables on it.  I thought it was too bready.  I liked the salad and the appetizers well enough though.  Not so much the atmosphere or the pizza.  The only versions of deep dish that have really left me wanting more have been from Bacino's and Calo's.,6,2,negative
4198,"LOOOVE Pequod's.  The only reason I cannot give this place five stars is because the pizza tastes slightly different each time.  Having been here over 10 times, this past experience was the best it prompted me to finally write a review.  The sauce was perfectly tart with the right amount of cheese and toppings: half pepp/half sausage being my favorite.The crust is unbelievable and I have no idea where they found the crust caramelizing wizard.  They probably lock him in a cage to never see the light of day as this sets it apart from all other pizza places I have been to, and is what keeps me returning for more.The Medium is perfect for 2 as you get a great balance of crust and toppings.  My ultimate favorite is the $4.95 lunch deal with pop/beer not only for the outrageous value, but for the balance of crust and the rest.  Pequod's doesn't skimp on toppings for the personal size which fosters its loyal following.i dream of Pequod's on a daily basis and am really bummed I can't go here tonight, despite having been this past Saturday.  It's that good.",8,1,positive

The pizza is the kicker, their thin crust is good, but you're in Chicago and you want pizza, that means unless you're headed north to Great Lakes then go for the real thing, the deep dish. The deep dish here is awesome, unfortunately, those of us who have tried know that delivered deep dish is NEVER as good--the metal pans they use for eating in-house are key.In short, don't go for the ambiance go for the deep dish, and if you are lucky enough to be taking a date who likes a good deep dish, take her (or him) along order a pint or two and enjoy the amazing deep dish Pequods has to offer.",13,2,positive

I think I can just cut the crust off the entire pizza and eat the crust wheel.We had one large pepperoni and sausage, one large pepperoni, and one large Canadian bacon and mushrooms. The pepperoni and sausage was awesome. The sausage was delicious and flavorful. The pepperoni was nice and crispy. The Canadian bacon wasn't flavorful enough to hold up to the thick dough.

4218,"Normally I wouldn't review a place that has so many reviews already (especially when everyone basically agrees that Pequod's has the best pizza in chicago), but I'm posting and giving 5 stars anyways just to counteract the two reviews (Michael W and Tina) who gave it 2 and 3 stars, respectively, for being a crummy white sox bar.Um, how do I say this gently, IT'S A PIZZA RESTAURANT, NOT A BAR!Seriously, how stupid do you have to be to think this is a bar? How could you be confused, did you notice that everyone was eating pizza?  That every table had pizza menus, shakers, and napkims and forks? That the actual bar has like 5 seats which people only sit at if they're waiting for a table?  That the overwhelming smell that hits you when you walk in is PIZZA- not beer?If you're looking for a bar, go to a bar- there's one two doors down.  If you want to eat pizza, then go to Pequod's, you'll be happy.Oh, and they happen to have a great, albeit small, beer list too//",3,4,positive
4219,I truly believe this is the best pizza I've had in Chicago.  The pan pizza is absolutely unreal.  By some miracle I finished the large pan pizza by myself and it was one of the best eating experiences I've ever had.  The mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders are a great add on but the pizza is absolutely the best!,6,0,positive
4220,"Absolute best deep-dish pan pizza in Chicago. Caramelized crust adds some char flavor and saltiness but doesn't overwhelm the pizza itself. Think Lou Malnati's times five (LM x 5 = awesome). This is just Chicago pizza done right, at an affordable price, with an incredibly large serving of food. A large pan and a few beers could easily feed a half dozen happy people.",6,0,positive
4221,I think I built this up in my mind a little too much beforehand. I'm a pizza fanatic and I'm always trying to find the best pizza of my life. I was told to try Pequod's ASAP. We picked it up and took it home one snowy night. We didn't get meat on it which I think may have been part of the problem. We got the deep-dish style with mushrooms. The crust was AMAZING I'm not going to lie about that. It is burnt a little bit with a glaze they put on which is really delicious. It was the main pizza part that I was kinda disappointed with. I didn't think there was enough cheese or sauce - it was mostly breading. Call me crazy - but I'm just not crazy about Pequod's!,3,4,negative
4222,"Another AMAZING pizza place if you enjoy deep dish delicious-ness!  Great place if you're craving deep dish.  The wait is a bit long, but it is well worth it.  I went a few weeks ago and split a medium deep dish with several toppings (mushrooms, onions, black olives).  The pizza had about an inch thick of cheese on the top and the toppings are plentiful.  The sauce wasn't overly sweet but had very good flavor.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area.  It will not disappoint!",8,2,positive

4224,"Not sure what the big deal is here?? I'll sum up my experience..1.) Took 2 hours on a sat night for our pizza,2 hours for our salads and 2 hours and 30 minutes for our over cooked and tiny bowel of pasta--2.) I'm not a fan o their thin crust ( their deep dish is good and the only reason why I'm giving them 2 stars!) They pretty much just slap a ton of meat on it and ignore putting quality cheese on the pie..3.) Service is BAD and they know it!!! Took 2 hours for our salads to even come out and the owner was sitting around socializing, our waitress was mia and flirting with the bar tender-- the people next to us walked out! Said I would have walked out myself but I know our 3 year old would have been heart broken! We got our pizza-- ate  quickly and as possible and when we were ready for our check they brought out my over cooked pasta dish!!! Asked the waitress to please take it off because it looked disgusting.. She gave me this look and said she would have to talk with someone else and that if I waited another 35 minutes they could make us a new bowl-- you've got to be kidding-- I insisted that she take it off our bill... not worth your time!!! It's packed to the gills with loud/ drunk depaul students, not a good place for families!",6,4,negative
4225,"I'm fine being the only person that did not enjoy the pizza here AT ALL. Yes the burnt cheese on the crust is good but I can do that at home.  The rest of the crust is TOO thick, too much bread. Not enough cheese. They give a decent amount of toppings but they'd have to give me a mountain of meat and cheese to make that much bread tasty. I know I hate it when I stop eating after 1 slice. I NEVER STOP EATING AFTER ONE SLICE!Also our server was kind of an idiot. When I said ""can we get a round of water for everyone"", that doesn't mean 4 glasses of water for 7 people. Simple math girl. Simple math.",5,2,negative
4226,Pizza is fantastic but never get pizza without some sort of customer service problem.  Phone orders are often met with arrogance or rude behavior.  When picking up pizza wait staff can be rude - as if they are being inconvenienced or just don't like their job.  No doubt this is the best pizza in Chicago.  Just a shame that their service isn't somewhere near as good as their pizza.,4,5,negative
4227,"The pan pizza is a must with caramelized crust!!!! One piece is plenty as well. Atmosphere is friendly and comfy. There was an overwhelming pine sol scent in the restaurant, but at least the place is clean. Semi open kitchen and clean bathrooms a major +. Street parking relatively easy and non metered.  Pizza delivered doesn't lose any quality either.****And there is a M-F 11-3pm special for a 7 inch pan with one topping+cheese and a pop or tap beer for $4.95!!!!!  Crazy deal, missed it by an hour, oh well, hope you can make it!!****",7,0,positive
4228,"I don't get their pizzas. I was so excited to read ""caramelized crust"", but by caramelized they really mean burnt. The edges are burnt and the crust is.. well, it's just bread. I don't think they use yeast.. more like baking soda or baking powder as a riser, and so it tastes more like very thick breadsticks than what you'd expect as pizza dough that Italian chefs spin in the air. Not enough cheese. Sauce was too salty. I would never rate this as one of Chicago's bestest pizzas as others have put it. I've had better.",6,0,negative

4231,I was working across the street and seen they had a $5 personal pan pizza lunch special.  I don't even like pan pizza but it was awesome.  The crust was nice and crispy with huge pieces of sausage that wasn't overly greasy and loaded with thick chunks of onions. I loved the sauce and it had plenty of cheese.  One of the best pizzas ever.,5,1,positive

4234,"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 9 friends. Got seated right away upstairs. It took for-e-ver for the pizza to arrive and when it did I was definitely not impressed. We were not informed of the length of the wait and tables that ordered after us got their food first. To top it all off, we ordered a cheese pizza that arrived stone cold. The worst part was watching the waitress behind the bar take a huge paddle brush out of her purse and run it through her hair several times and pull her hair into a ponytail many times. And, she kept smoothing her hair back with both hands. Then, she served drinks and food without washing her hands. Eww. Never again.",3,2,negative

It was excellent and the perfect amount of pizza (for lunch)..the service was good and attentive. The place is more of a sports bar with some flat screens and a couple of arcade games. The front windows open up during summer and feels great. I am def going back for dinner and a larger pie.",8,0,positive

4239,I went here based on yelp reviews. This is the worst pizza I have ever had. It was so bad I declined to take home the 2/3rd left over pizza. I would have preferred a frozen pizza. I had great expectations and left hungry and disappointed. The deep dish is all crust and very little cheese and toppings. I live a couple of blocks away from this place and was hoping for a good pizza joint walking distance from my house. If it was even close to okay I would be a regular. Maybe the thin crust is better. I should have listened to a friend of mine who always told me its not all that good. Just to be fair I won't mention the pizza places I like. Most of the time I would give a place another try. In this case I will pass.,6,4,negative
4240,"I rarely give 1 star - maybe I am a little bitter because I was expecting so much from everyone's review of this place. Ok maybe it should be more like a 2 if they actually cooked our pizza thoroughly. We ordered a large deep dish with sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms. it came out with the famous caramelized crust, the bread dough was rawish  in the center, and bellpeppers and mushroom topping was not cooked and the pizza sauce was cold!We took most of it home, my poor husband got diarrhea later that night, so we just ended up tossing this out entirely.",2,2,negative

Having tried their thin crust before, I was a bit skeptical about her excitement. She opened up the pizza box and there was a pie filled with sauces, mushrooms, veggies, and looking mighty delicious.Upon closer inspection after my first bite, I noticed that this piece of pie was not stuffed to the brim with cheese! In fact, it was made with plenty of dough, giving it a unique twist to the Chicago Deep Dish. I was very pleased particularly with the crust that was caramelized that had extra bite and super taste. I wish they delivered to my house!",5,2,positive

Im not really a fan of pizza, its not my favorite thing in the world. Ill eat it if im hungry though. My cousin decided we should order deep dish from Pequod's for everyone at the office. Me not being a pizza fan, I wasn't too excited. As it turns out Peqoud's is DELICIOUS. I recommend this place to friends and family all the time. I've tried several other pizza places after because i thought maybe i like it because it was deep dish and i have never had deep dish before. Hands down, this is the best pizza i have ever tasted. It was perfect and the caramelized crust was just the icing on the cake. The pizza was also delivered in a timely manner and the delivery man was very polite. Great pizza and great service, you cant go wrong!",9,1,positive
4245,"Decent deepdish. This is Chicago ya know.  So it is hard for me to say it is the best or even a runner-up, but it is pretty darn good.They don't have the sauce on top, like Girodanos or Gino's, but that doesn't matter to me.  I love that their crust is carmelized, but there is something wrong with the taste of the crust.  It has a sourdough kind of taste to it, but like it's sourdough not cooked all the way.  Well, whatever the reason, there's just something a little bit off about the crust and that was really the only downside. All in all this is pretty good deepdish and the service was great.  We sat upstairs and I was thoroughly impressed that the waitstaff got up and down that huge flight of stairs so quickly so many times.",10,3,positive

I absolutely love the caramelized crust, it's what makes the pizza. We usually get the appetizer sampler or the fried mushrooms to start- as far as friend mushrooms go these are great. Service is always friendly, and every time we've been in the owner is there and makes a point to welcome everyone who walks through the door. I like the bar atmosphere on the first level. I like to sit there if possible. On about our third visit we were seated upstairs- which I didn't even know existed- and it's huge! Still a nice atmosphere and family friendly.",9,1,positive

4258,"Fav Street Reporter back again. Its been a minute, but you still love me and I still love you. Now lets talk Pequod's:So was with the homie Kelsey K. and she told me about Pequod's. Said it was really that deal.  So she jumps on the horn and orders 3 deep dishers for about 10 of our peoples. Damn near was a skeleton by the time it arrived it took so long (roughly 1 hour +), but once it got there......ddeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!!! (like when Red got knocked out by D-Bo on Friday). This deep dish is so chaotically hectic! The crust is perfectly buttery and the edge is black (as in burned), but there isn't one bite that is imperfect. Sauce is on point. Cheese and toppings are on point...its crazy.  Take it from me, your Favorite Street Reporter,  who is from Chi and knows a thing or two about Chicago deep dish. Pequod's may have quietly slipped in that back door and stolen the crown, pulling off the impossible.  So lets pay attention....straight up and down...cause this is only a story....from the real...Good talk.",4,6,positive

She was super rude. We walked in and she asked us how many seats we needed. I told her ""two"", she grabbed a couple menus asked us to follow her, literally threw them on the table and then walked away. I would have told her off but I didn't want to risk our pizza being spit on. Anyway, watch out for her. She's a tall average looking Caucasian girl with dark blond her.

4269,"My roommate has been telling me for months now that Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago. The man should forever make my pizza eating decisions, as Pequod's was able to beat Gino's East as my favorite pizza in Chicago.The crust is what really sells me. It is crisp on the bottom with a bit of doughy satisfaction just above that. Then the sauce hits you with its full arsenal of flavor and tag teams your tounge with the other toppings that are generously arranged on top. For the cherry on top: that crispy, crunchy, not-burnt-but-also-a-little-burnt edge of the crust that gives this pizza a unique personality unlike anything else in Chicago. There are a lot of seats in this place but they all seemed to get full before we left on a Friday night, and I say if you have to wait on one of the benches conveniently located just outside the door the pizza you will soon enjoy will be worth your wait.The only complaint I have is that their beer list is a little short. However this is redeemed by being filled by microbrews (aside from the token Lite anyway) and pitchers are a welcomed option. Quality over quantity is an acceptable ideal for a beer list, so pour yourself a tasty pint of Dortmunder and get ready to try your new favorite Chicago pizza.",12,1,positive

4272,"We decided to dine on ""the best deep dish"" in Chicago, but man, this was disappointing as heck!  Perhaps it was good once upon a time, but no longer.  We ordered a 12"" for 2 people, topped with sausage, pepperoni, peppers and onions (of course, cheese and tomato sauce below that).  The pizza showed up about 30min later, looked nice around the edges but the first bite was cold, raw dough and the toppings weren't much better (cold/raw).  The waitress saw that we weren't eating it quickly so she asked if all was ok, when we said 'not really' she picked up the spatula and started to stab at the pizza from all angles, which disassembled the layers. She summoned the manager who immediately admitted that the pizza was below par and ""undercooked by about 2 minutes"" (10% of the cooking time, he later clarified). He offered to ""throw a few slices back into the oven"" but agreed it would not be the same even cook that a pizza should have - if you run a pizza joint yet can't make a pizza properly, ain't that a problem? The venue itself was nothing special, which we actually liked, but the guys who bring the pizza to your table are also busy taking bags of trash and big dirty trash cans around the restaurant and there is NOT a lot of hand washing going on.  In the end, we paid for the pizza but only ate a few nibbles around the edges.  Overall, can't say that Pequod's takes pride in its craft: aside from the front from staff, the toppings were rather chaotically tossed all over the ill-cooked pizza and it was clearly made in haste by people that consider making pizza just a job.  Without a little passion coming from the kitchen, might as well eat Pizza Hut.",10,8,negative

4275,"Even though we're Palermo's die hards, we just had to try Pequod's after reading all the awesome reviews.  We love Palermo's sweet sauce, and numerous Pequod's reviews said the same thing.  If you didn't know any better you'd pass right by this place.  The outside is no frills and doesn't look like anything special.  Inside, the staff is very laid back and friendly; how can you not love servers that sport g-string wearing wales on their shirts?!  Want a Pequod's g-string?  They sell them!   The first thing we noticed besides the fun atmosphere is the fact that they sell Tucher beer.  I don't know anyone else who sells this deliciousness in a bottle.  The only place Tim's ever had it was in Germany.  We decided on the infamous pan pizza which certainly didn't disappoint.  Yes, there was a lot of crust but that's what a PAN pizza is people!!  The delicious slightly burnt crust and cheese is as good as everyone says it is.  I didn't think the sauce was sweet, but that certainly didn't make it bad.We ended up ordering Pequod's do be delivered about a week later.  This time we went for the thin crust just to see how it compared.  The thin crust was also very good, and yes, less crust.  Tim ended up ordering it last weekend, once again he ordered the pan.  We were afraid the pizza wouldn't be as good as it is when you eat in, but I saw little to no difference.The consensus?  Tim likes the pan better than Palermo's, but he thinks Palermo's is better when it comes to thin crust.  As much as I like Pequod's I still have to stand by my ol' favorite...Palermo's.  I certainly won't pass up an invite to go to Pequod's though, and next time I'm buying one of those g-strings.",19,4,positive

I don't despise pizza, it's just hardly ever something I crave. However, Pequod's was amazing! I loved how crispy the crust was! My out-of-state friends are wanting to try deep dish and I had no idea where to take them until I had Pequod's! Plus, it doesn't hurt that they're a Blackhawks bar!",6,2,positive
4280,"So I went here with a friend who had moved out of Chicago...I think I walked about 10 miles to get here...no joke. So after my crazy hike across freakin' Chicago, we arrived at Pequod's.Service was so nice! and the famous crust was worthy of fame. So freakin' good! One of those eating experiences when you wish you weren't with a boy you liked so you could just go pig-crazy and chow down with abandon...stupid cute boys *angry face* ruining my meal!",7,3,positive
4281,"A place with over 800 reviews doesn't need mine. But I'm gonna anyway, because Pequod's is part of why Chicago is awesome (to me).You know how some people get hung up on ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends? They remember past relationships so fondly that every relationship from then on gets compared to that ""one."" Yeah. That's pretty much how I feel about Pequod's. This was the first deep dish pizza I had when I moved to Chicago a year ago and it might as well have been the only deep dish pizza I've had. Sure, I've come across others during my time here, but nothing compares (cue Sinead O'Connor's bald head here). Sure, the atmosphere is very Chicago sports bar-y, but you'll forget all about that when that tomatoey, cheesy, and whatever other toppings-y slice hits your taste buds. I don't know how they do it, but the caramelized crust is perfectly cheesy, crunchy, but chewy at the same time. I could seriously eat an entire pizza, of just caramelized crust. I don't know what that would look like, but I don't care, I want it in my belly. As for the rest of the pizza, they don't hold back on the toppings, and you'll eat until you're painfully full, but still want to eat more. It's just that good. The pizza, beer, and service is great, and even though this is such a popular pizza spot, they've maintained a hometown, local feel, which I love. So play roulette with the topping choices, they're all pretty dang delicious. Just eat here, and get hung up on their pizza like I am.",13,4,positive

This place definitely competes as a top choice when ordering Chicago style pizza.

4283,"Pequod's is top quality gourmet pizza.  My mom is Sicilian, so I was raised on artisan pizza.  At Pequod's it is all about the sauce and the crust.  Most pizza in Chicago is a boat of cheese.  Pequod's goes lighter with the cheese, and in my opinion gives the perfect amount.  Their crust is crisp and flavorful (made in a cast iron skillet) and I highly recommend the mushroom.They also deliver farther west than most other pizza places on the east side.GO PEQUOD'S!",5,0,positive

4285,"My favorite Chicago deep dish pizza!  It may not be the ""traditional"" deep dish, but I think it tastes the best.  You gotta love that slightly burnt, caramelized pan pizza crust.  It's kinda like Pizza-Hut-meet-deep-dish (but better tasting).  I really like the large chunks of toppings.  The red sauce complements the crust and the toppings well.  Unlike Giordano's or the other big name pizzas, Pequod's isn't loaded with cheese.  That's a good thing - it's nice to be able to walk somewhat after a meal, rather than being immobilized with cheese in your veins.  It's also cool that Pequod's still remains more of a local restaurant than a huge chain (like the other Pizzerias) that is expanding to every suburb known to man.Recommendations: gotta get deep dish, be prepared for a wait unless you go early, and order some meat toppings even if you're a vegetarian :)",12,1,positive
4286,My lord does this place have it's own unique style of deep dish pizza?! I love a pizza place that has it's own style. 1 slice and I'm usually pretty good.

4293,"I know, I know...you've probably read that same phrase on every yelp pizza place review. But this is the real deal, and I'll tell you why.First off, I live in Bridgeport...so pizza has to be FANTASTIC for me to drive to the north side. Second, they know how to make a real pizza! The caramelized crust is the perfect combination of baked/burnt/carmalization goodness. Also, they know how to put on the toppings. When I want sausage, I don't want little pea sized nuggets of ground beef mixed with table salt and pepper thrown on.  I want god damn chunks! A ballet of cheese and toppings and I want to see burned/backed tops as if the sausage was cooked on an open pit flame grill....Pequods does it.I went there recently with a small group of friends and we experimented with a Green Olive, Anchovies, and Jalapeño pizza....WOW! AWESOME!Now the interior does get to be a little sports bar like, but I'm here for pizza so I could give a crap about what game it on. The waitstaff is young and sometimes they're on the slow side...but its pizza!

4294,"""Our deep dish is baked in cast iron pans blackened by decades of seasoning. The overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.""  - PequodsOkay, Pequods, your prose is worthy of your namesake Melville. In fact, ""a halo of caramelized crust"" is almost poetic. But tell me this: WHY IS THE WHALE WEARING A THONG ON HIS HEAD? The possibly obscene answer to this riddle went unexplained, none of the waitstaff knew the reason.When you walk in, you see the neon sign with the whale and this pink thing, figure it must be the whale is eating a slice of pizza. Then on the poster inside, looks kind of different... is this some species of whale with unusual natural markings on its head? No, turns out that it's a thong. There must still be someone around from the good old days who knows the origin of the story. This place is classic Chicago, has been in business since 1970. Actually it's partly a sports bar, with TV's showing all of the local sports games, especially the Blackhawks. Beers on tap included Sam Adams, Goose Island, Half Acre, and Stella Artois. Served cold, cold, cold, in chilled glasses. They have big neon signs of all of the major breweries, as well as lots of signs and paraphernalia for the sports teams. And there are some classic movie posters - Cary Grant, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, etc. Some of the other posters look like enlargements of family photos from the 1970's.There are two levels, the layout is kind of narrow but the second floor adds a lot of space. It's more quiet up there when the ground floor gets bustling, and it has its own bar. Open late. The menu is simple, the whole thing fits on one side of a laminated card. They have pastas, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers in addition to the pizza. Not cheap but not expensive, either. There are wooden chopping blocks / serving boards on the tables which are cut in the shape of whales. They really do have their own style of pizza going on at Pequod's, it's not quite like any other Chicago deep-dish. Personally I thought the ""caramelized halo"" was good, they intentionally let the cheese get slightly burned around the edge of the top. The rest of the crust is thick and fluffy. The sauce is rather plain, doesn't have much taste of its own, so recommend adding some ingredients. Fun and unpretentious place with what most people will agree is good pizza. The style may not be to everyone's liking, you would have to try it to find out, since it's fairly unique. Ladies, beware of whales suddenly surfacing in unexpected places.

I could go on for a long time on this topic, I'll spare you.Based on the one slice of Pequod's tomato basil pizza generously passed to me by Lou the barmaid at Nisei Lounge one chilly February evening, I was solidly into it. I reserve the last star for a visit, as this was only delivery, but the cheesy crust thing kinda won me over. Solid.",3,2,positive

4300,"This review is tough to write because, from a taste standpoint, Pequod's HAD been a pizza that I'd enjoyed twice in past experiences after trying it for the first time a year or so ago. After my most recent experience, however, I will not be returning as a customer - unless there happens to be a change in management.On a Saturday evening (4:45pm), I phoned in an order of two pizzas (one thin crust and one deep dish) for our family. I was informed my wait would be approximately 50-60 minutes. I showed up at the restaurant at 5:40pm after 55 minutes and was informed that my pizzas still needed about 10-15 minutes. On a busy Saturday night, I thought this was reasonable and appreciated them letting me know (vs. just saying it would be ""a couple more minutes"").After 20 additional minutes had passed, I asked about the status of my order and was told the takeout server would be back shortly. When she returned, I was told that they just put one of my pizzas IN the oven - 80 minutes after I placed the order. After waiting another 10 minutes, the manager came out with both pizzas. Upon expressing my frustration for their clear delay in placing part of the order, and the fact that the first pizza of mine had been sitting there for 20+ minutes, he offered me $15 off a future order, and said my delay was ""typical"" for them. Given the experience to that point, I should have checked the pizzas on the spot, but upon returning home and opening the box, the pan pizza that had been sitting for 30+ minutes (by that time) had completely collapsed in the box, leaving a smeared mess of toppings and sauce and a thoroughly soggy box. The thin crust pizza that had been forgotten was burned considerably on the crust (past the normal ""carmelization"" of Pequod's crusts). I really was looking for a simple mea culpa from the manager. Everyone makes mistakes; but he continually expressed that my experience (even the pizza waiting on top of the oven for 20+ minutes) was typical for them and offered no recourse on my current order. If this is the ""typical"" Pequod's experience, count me out. I can think of 4-5 other spots (Art of Pizza, Lou Malnati's, Jet's, Bricks) on the north side of the city that serve a more consistent pizza and, most importantly, take accountability if they happen to make a mistake.",7,4,negative
4301,"Let me preface this by saying I am a fan of New York pizza, and I don't consider Chicago Deep Dish (only 1 year older than the twinkie) to really be pizza.That being said this place was pretty decent.  We asked if the dough was vegan, and they said it was, and with no cheese that means no caramelized.  Crust was okay though, a little dry for me.  Sauce was good, toppings as well.  Next time I may get normal/thin crust.  One waiter told us he loves putting the vegan parm on his pizza at home, but I don't think they had any here.  They should get some Teese here!  I like having the oregano and red pepper on the table without having to ask.  Staff was amazingly friendly and nimble despite the thick Saturday evening crowd.  People were packed to the gills but I didn't feel cramped and the volume of the was still ok enough to have a conversation.",10,1,positive

The sauce is on the sweeter side, which works well for this particular pizza. I have ordered delivery and eaten at the restaurant and both were terrific. When you order delivery they cover it the pizza with foil and then put it in the box, keeps everything fresher, a nice touch by Pequods.FYI, I wouldn't quite classify the pan pizza as typical Chicago style deep dish, but it is just as good. They also have a great beer selection if you eat there.",10,0,positive

4309,"I really, really, really wanted to love this place.  I'd heard so many good things, and my friend and I used to drool at it while we worked out across the street at Bally's and she would tell me how amazing it was.  We often said we needed to make our way over there, and tonight we finally did.Service was...  how do I put this...  the very definition of lackadaisical.  (Yes, I've been dying to use that in a sentence.)  When I entered, a guy informed me all the booths were full and just kind of motioned towards the tables.  I took that as my cue to pick my own table.Table selected, we sat down and our server came over.  We ordered drinks, and she didn't seem to want to take our food order.  I can't figure that out.  I started with the house salad, which was very... wet.  I felt like I needed a paper towel to take some of the water off the lettuce.  The salad was just okay, nothing earth shattering.  My friend got the minestrone soup, and I didn't think to ask her how it was but she gobbled it up so I would assume it was good.We ordered a thin crust pizza....  yet when they brought it out it was pan.  We said we ordered thin.  The server said we ordered pan.  I assured her we did not, as pan was never even a consideration for us.  The server said it would be 10 minutes to get a new pizza.  Okay, fine.  But there were no apologies for screwing up our order, and I felt like we were putting her out.  You know, for *her* mistake.Finally the correct pizza came out, and it was piping hot.  I was so excited to dig in...  but it was just...  missing the mark completely.  The crust I had heard so much about was dry and didn't really have any flavor.  The sauce was eh.  The cheese was eh.  I mean, it's pizza, it's pretty hard to screw up, but it just fell way short of my expectations.Pizza consumed, we waited forever for our check.  Then we got to talking and might have forgotten about it.  But when we realized they were getting busy and we needed to give up our table, our server kept walking by and not picking up the check and the obvious credit card laid down on top of it.  I finally flagged her down, and we finally managed to leave.I hate to say it, but I won't be going out of my way to come back here.  But they were pretty busy tonight, so I'm thinking they won't miss my business...",13,4,negative

4313,"I have eaten quite a bit of pizza in my day, and this comes in 2nd place behind Lou's for deep dish pizza. I have read a couple reviews below of people talking about how deep dish pizza is not very good and not pizza. These people DO NOT know pizza and the variety in which it can be presented for your mouth and taste buds. Pequod's has a very distinct taste. It has definitely set itself apart from Lou's in this fashion which is great because it gives me some variety on great deep dish pizza. The pepperoni was excellent. The crust it not as flavorful as Lou's but the cheese is very good and the sauce is unique and tasty. The reason I gave this location 3 stars only is because the wait and seating was AWFUL. When we got there they told us it would be about 30 minutes. Well we ended up waiting for over an hour to be seated. They do not have a waiting area and therefore if it is cold outside you are forced to stand inside pushing against other peoples tables. Not only is it awkward for you as people are squeezing by, but it also is unpleasant to be eating while people are surrounding you to wait for their table. I will be trying the Morton Grove location.

4329,"I'm usually a thin crust girl when it comes to pizzas, but I'd heard rave reviews about Pequod's and had to try the pan to see what all the fuss was about. If the review were just for the pizza, I'd give it 3 stars. It was good, but nothing I'd run back for, though the ""caramelized"" cheese around the edge of the crust is my favorite part. It was definitely plentiful and a medium pizza lasted my boyfriend and I two meals. The crust doesn't reheat very well, though, so I'd recommend only ordering what you think you can finish. The sausage was good, crumbled and fresh with just the right amount of spice. It was a little bready for my taste, though. The reason I'll be back is for the good service and good beer. We were seated right away on a busy, Saturday night, upstairs and in a back room I didn't know existed. Still, the atmosphere was lively and fun. There were lots of tvs showing various football games. The beer list was pretty good for what I was expecting. A few craft beers make the list, and we shared a reasonably priced pitcher of Great Lakes beer while waiting for our pizza. We had a great night and a great dinner there, so if I'm with someone who has a hankering for thick, pan pizza, I'll point them in the direction of the neon whale with a thong on his head.",18,1,positive
4330,"Ok, so I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza. That's right, I said it.Anyway, an old friend came in from out of town and naturally wanted to get some Chicago style eats. Pequod's was her choice, I was just there for the conversation. Turns out that this is THE ONLY deep dish pizza that I've ever enjoyed. The caramelized cheese crust was awesome, but what I really liked was the fact that this wasn't just a pie crust filled with cheese, as I've had at many other places. The dough was fluffy and soft and the bottom of the pizza was super crispy.  All and all it was a damn good pizza. The service was great as well. Pricey beer, though. And just to clear things up - their mushrooms are NOT canned, as one other reviewer had said (all of our toppings were super fresh and yummy.)I may go back there someday if I'm ever wanting deep dish, but I don't really see that happening. Hey, at least now I know that I don't find all Chicago style pizza inedible! Kudos, Pequod's.",12,1,positive
4331,"How have I never reviewed this place? The 700+ reviews speak for themselves and I don't have anything original to add. This pizza is GOOD. The ""caremelized"" cheese (read: burned) around the edge of the crust gives their deep dish pizza a unique flavor. I like the kind of chaotic bar atmosphere as well. Great place!",2,2,positive
4332,"Loved this place! While were vacationing in Chicago we decided to eat as much deep dish pizza as possible.  For my boyfriend, that was easy, but for me as a vegan it was not so simple.  At Pequod's the waitress was super nice and had no problem with my request for a deep dish pizza minus the cheese.  She explained how they caramelize the crust using cheese, but said they could skip that for mine. So nice.  I got the vegan version with green peppers, onions and spinach.  Fantastic! My boyfriend got pepperoni.  We each ordered smalls instead of personals and the waitress warned that it would be a lot of food and we would have leftovers.  I told her not to be so sure.  My boyfriend managed to eat almost his entire pizza, and I took one piece back to the hotel (where I ate it later).  This place was very casual and had a great vibe.  The pizza was fantastic.  We will definitely go back if we are ever in Chicago again.",6,1,positive
4333,"Let me preface this review by saying I do not like deep dish pizza. I know, I know.  I LOVE Chicago hot dogs, the Cubs, Bears, and Bulls, so don't take away my residency just yet.  I even like the Sox, except when they play the Cubs.  But, I digress...Even though I've previously professed my dislike for deep dish pizza, I really truly like it from Pequod's.  I'm not sure what it is about this particular kind.  The crust is charred on the outside, and isn't too buttery.  There's a great flavor that I haven't been able to get from any other places.  For my buck, this is the best deep dish pie in Chicago hands down (and I've tried many)!  As someone else mentioned, they have a $4.95 lunch deal for a 7"" personal pizza and a drink.  That right there has caused many many a guilt-inspired trip to Bally's across the street.  But, it tastes so good at the moment!Check it out.  The price is good, and you won't be disappointed.",9,2,positive

4335,"The first time we had Pequod's was after many hours spent at Webster's Wine Bar up the street.  Granted, we were starving, but what came next was just silly good.  Pan pizza with black olives, sausage, pepperoni, and fresh garlic.  Pitcher of Blue Moon and the four of us were set.  That was 2 years ago.I've ordered in advance to pick up to take back home to the W. Suburbs (try driving 50 miles in rush hour with THAT aroma in the car), brought visiting family here during a very crowded Friday or Saturday, dropped in after a Sox game, it's always been good.  Make no mistake, I have not yet tried the thin crust, only the pan.  Don't go here expecting the original Pizzeria Uno / Ike Sewell / Rudy Malnati deep dish formula from 1943.  You know, the Lou Malnati's formula (my 2nd place).  It's a variation, so I don't know if you can  call it ""deep dish"" in the traditional sense, but ""pan pizza"" fits.  The crust is thicker, there is slightly less cheese, and they don't use a manhole cover of sausage.  And, luckily, there is no cornmeal in the crust.  The sauce is sweeter, resembling sauce from Aurelio's or Chicago Dough Company from down in Richton Park.  The ingredients are always fresh, and the service is always fantastic.  The manager is out there seating people, taking orders, bringing out pizza, checking in on you.  If you go to Pequod's with an open mind and not expecting the traditional formula for deep dish, you will not be disappointed.  It's simply a fun place.",6,4,positive
4336,"I hadn't had Pequod's Pizza in years, it is just as awesome as I remembered.  It is good to know some thing's never change.  You know it is truly good pizza when the cheese pizza is a satisfying choice, but when it come to toppings there is no skimping.",4,0,positive
4337,Almost speechless at how good this pan pizza is.

4340,"ive right around the corner from pequods, so im loyal to this place.  but besides the convenience factor its seriously the best deep dish/pan pizza ive ever had.  I recently discovered ordering extra cheese to it makes the pizza even better! Im a creature of habit and almost always order my pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese, sometimes ill venture out and get mushroom, sausage and spinach. Either way, you can't go wrong! The crust is a carmalized  cheese, which happens due to the pan they use (or so i read somewhere) its nice and crispy.  This place gets slammed on game nights, especially during hockey season....actually i think its safe to say its slammed every friday/saturday/sunday night. The pizzas typically take 30min to make so call in ahead and make your drive or order when you get there and enjoy a beer or two at the bar.  They serve thin crust as well, pretty good, but i go here for the pan/deep dish...i tell everyone visiting or new to chicago that this is the plac to go to for good chicago pizza.Oh just to add pretty decent lunch special, i think its $5 for a personal pizza and drink.",14,1,positive
4341,In the city that perfected pizza - Pequod's is perfect pizza.The service is always friendly and quick. The pizza is amazing.  We go about once a month and get a pitcher of Blue Moon and a large sausage pizza. (The pitcher is like 18 bucks so we are considering alternatives.) The servers are always on the ball - they are very relaxed and just do their thing. The pizza is thick - not really deep dish in the purest sense of the word.  The sauce is sweet but not sugary - the sausage is fresh - not pre-cut or prepackaged. The thing is - though - the crust. The crust is crunchy and light and flaky and delicious beyond Yelping. What my people would call a peasant crust - I can't get enough of it.We are going tonight - get our table near the window - and get lost in the best pizza Chicago has to offer...,10,1,positive

4344,"Went here recently with friends and we figured out the key to getting a delicious pizza at pequods. If you're a meat lover, go nuts as their toppings are as good as anywhere. If you're a vegan just keep it basic. It seems like when you order more than 2 non meat toppings on a pizza it gets way too soggy because of all the water. We had a sausage, spinach, and garlic pan pizza here and it was excellent. The service is always good even when there busy. And it's clean, spacious, and has big screen tv's so you don't have to miss the game. Overall after being an afterthought when it comes to pizza options, Pequod's is officially in my regular pizza rotation again after a brief hiatus. Good to have you back guys!",8,0,positive
4345,"The most AMAZING crust in the city!  I absolutely LOVE their deep dish pizza.  My husband and I regular order from here, and we have ate in their dining room a few times as well.  We typically get the pan pizza half cheese (for me) and half pepperoni (for him).  I usually insist on the Pequod's salad with house vingarette.  The salad is pretty average, but the pizza is what knocks my socks off.  The crust has this crunchy parmesan taste.  It is SO unique and delicious.  My husband occasionally complains that the pizza doesn't have enough sauce.  However, we never seem to remember to ask for more, so I am not sure what their response would be if you requested it.  I really like the atmosphere when you dine in at Pequod's.  It has a really relaxed almost bar feel.  For me, it's a tie between Lou Malnati's and Pequod's for the best deep dish in Chicago.",7,1,positive
4346,"Great place for pizza when you want a change of pace from the typical Chicago-style deep dish. Stick with their pan-style which leaves the best crunchy and crispy crust around the edge. Usually we order the pepperoni and sausage and you can't go wrong.If it wasn't for the very slow service (always slow from when it's packed on weeknights and weekends to even at 3:00p.m. with only 5 other tables occupied), I'd be giving it 5 stars.

4347,"I've been to most of the major ""touristy"" deep dish pizza players here in Chicago, so when my friends invited me to Pequods, I was definitely game.  We arrived at 7:00 on Friday night and our party of 5 was seated in under 5 mins.  I give MAJOR props for that.  I thought the food was a little underwhelming.  We ordered a medium sausage and a large peperoni.   They are famous for their pan (deep dish) pizza and the caramelized, burnt cheese crust.  I was expecting it to be better than it sounded, but wasn't really digging the taste-- too much burnt, not enough caramelized.  The crust goes on for DAYS too.  Where a lot of pizza places fill the deep dish with cheese, Pequods uses a tremendous amount of bread.  It did make one slice quite filling, which added to the bang for your buck prices-- as long as you like tons of crust.  The sausage was my favorite part.  Very satisfying-- just the right amount of sweet, salty and spicy.    Pequods didn't make my Top 5 on the Chicago Pizza list, but it delivers a solid pizza for a good price.",10,0,negative

4349,"alright, i went here for the first time this week with a few of my friends. this place isn't really trying to look cool or anything. it's just your average dim lit sports bar, with flat screen tvs and blackhawks jersey on the walls. what isn't so ordinary is their food selection. we ordered a half pepperoni/half mushroom, all bell pepper pizza. MMMMMM, wow! we also ordered the cheezy bread, which was 3.50, a great deal, if you ask me! if you have more than 4 people, you might want to order more than one, though. it's pretty small. the dough and crust were what is really memorable for me. it was soft AND crunchy. the zillions of pepperonis they packed onto my half of the pizza were super salty and not too greasy, like a lot of other pepperoni places.the waitresses were friendly and the total, for four people, came to $28 and a little change. i think place is a really great deal. i would say go here if you aren't looking to impress your date, or if you just want to grab a slice and a brew with your friends. i feel so mediocre about this place!!",11,2,negative

4354,"Hello Pequod's.  You are my new close friend.  After a long, cold walk through the city we finally made it to Pequod's for a taste of their famous deep dish pizza.  At 7:00 on a Saturday, we were seated immediately upon arrival, which is surprising since this place was so busy.  We started with a garlic bread appetizer and had a small taste of what was to come with their tasty sauce.  The pizza came out soon afterward and was quite delicious.  The crust was seriously perfect.  So crisp. So tasty.  And the price really wasn't bad at all.  Overall a near perfect evening.",5,2,positive
4355,"Pequod's is consistently fantastic pizza--the best deep dish in Chicago.Yes, that caramelized crust is to die for--an almost-sweet and crunchy touch to the savory goodness that lies within its borders. Even better than the crust is the quality of the toppings--hearty and big and just loaded with freshness. I no longer can order pizza with sausage, green pepper and onion at other joints because they cannot compare with Pequod's. The toppings are clearly not from some can or sitting in some fridge for days on end--they are as fresh as if they were just picked.It does get busy, so expect a bit of a wait. Expect to see some hockey on the big screen TVs if there's any being played--the boss here loves it.",8,1,positive

4357,"What if you increased the amount of crust boundary by putting a hole in the center, baking in special ring pans? Or maybe you get really fancy and manufacture a spiral aluminum thing, maybe an inch across to fit the pepperoni, and lay the pizza down in that so that literally EVERY bite has that ridiculous caramelized crunch fiesta on TWO edges? Well, physics lesson: too massive a quantity of that kind of awesome all concentrated like that would collapse to form a black hole of tastiness from which ultimately even the world could not escape. Wait, that was supposed to be a downside. Nevermind. Come here and be prepared to love.",4,3,positive

4360,"Pan Pizza?  More like deep dish!My wife and I rolled in to Chicago a little late on Friday, and were starving.  Thankfully, my friend had the foresight to order some pizza before we got to his joint.  Pequod's was his choice.  And while one might think you have to get Chicago style pizza in Chicago, this certainly is not a bad option.My friend ordered two pizzas- green peppers and mushrooms on one, and pepperoni and sausage on the other (carnivores gotta eat).  Typically the pizzas take anywhere from 40-50 minutes, so plan ahead people.We got there before the pizza arrived, but it wasn't long before we were rocking some of the best ""non-deep dish"" pizza I've ever had.  The two medium pizzas were enough to feed 7 (though 3 of those people weren't that hungry).  The sausage was pretty stellar, and they really packed on/in the toppings.  It was a great start to my weekend in Chicago.  Oh yeah, Pistons beat the Lakers that evening too, so double in your face!Overall- I would definitely order pizza from here again.Chuck Norris Rating- Head Slam",7,1,positive

4362,"Makes you forget your hunger, and what you were talking about...Now, choosing a great pizza place in Chicago is like choosing between a gorgeous brunette and a fiery redhead, you marry one and have a shot at a real life, or you gamble and chance landing in a trailer park with 2 kids that aren't yours, living off foodstamps and dance money.  What were we talkin' about?   Pizza, oh yeah.  PIZZA - First, ONLY order the pan pizza.  Thin?  No.  Thin is like, well, like the ugly cousin who just got out of prison.  A Russian prison in Uzbekistan.The pan pizza is perfect.  The seasoned, thick tomato gravy works its way into the thick, yet light crust.  The cheese and sausage (which is nice and chunky and imparting a great flavor to the crust) are a perfect complement.THE CRUST - When you get the pizza, the edge of the crust looks dark, almost burnt, but really, it's CARMELIZED.  Its probably a different cheese from mozzarella, but it's GOOD.  This is one time you want to save the crust for last.  Now, some people don't LIKE carmelized cheese, and that's okay.  You can knock a star off the review in your head, but I keep it at 5.CAVEATS - Parking stinks.  Almost everything else on the menu is just okay, so ONLY order the pan pizza.  Yeah, one trick pony, but this pony can recite Shakespeare while juggling.Order in advance, and order more, cause this is a great next breakfast pizza.  Especially if you chose the trailer park girl and her two kids.",14,5,positive
4363,"I've been eating Chicago Style pizza since I cut my first teeth, and Peaquod's became king of the hill in my book last year. After reading the rave reviews on GrubHub.com, my roommate ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. Usually, when either one of us orders pizza, we try and push the leftovers on the other the next day to avoid the guilt of eating pizza two nights in a row. The next day, I feasted on my first slice of microwaved Peaquod's pizza and it tasted better than most slices from  freshly baked pies elsewhere.Peaquod's formula for Chicago Style pizza strays slightly from the standard. Traditional Chicago Style pizza has a moderately thinner pie style crust and is layered with cheese, ingredients, and sauce. Peaquod's is essentially a thick pan pizza with no visible crust - just sauce and cheese straight to the edge. Because the cheese isn't in a hollowed crust, there is slightly less than you'd find on a pizza from Giordano's or Gino's East. As much as I love tons of melted cheese, I'm not bothered by the reduction. What they take away in cheese, they give back in ingredients. Holy freaking pepperoni!Now for the famous ""carmelized cheese crust"" that is mentioned in every review. Personally, it's hardly my favorite thing about Peaquod's but it does have an interestingly good taste. It tastes like a parmesan crisp ...only slightly charred with a bit of pizza sauce on the edge. It's kind of like croutons on a salad in that it's a nice crunchy add on, but overlookable in comparison to the dish it complements.Chicago Style traditionalists may not like Peaquod's because it's not like all the others. I love Chicago Style Pizza and thick crust pan pizza. Finding a place that somehow merged the two was a godsend. I've only had delivery from Peaquod's, but I am anxious to eventually taste a slice fresh out of the oven!",15,4,positive

4372,"Came here on a Oct 10 a Thursday night around 12am. My boyfriend and 2 other friends and I were so excited to try some Chicago deep dish pizza. We arrived it wasn't crowded at all which was cool because we were super hungry. We ordered the chicken wings, garlic bread, sausage mushroom peperoni deep dish, and my bf ordered his own cheese deep dish. The appetizers were good but I thought our pizza was just OKAY. What I didn't like was the crust. It was burnt and the dough just tasted so bland, no flavor what so ever. Our pizza toppings were mediocre. I was expecting our pizza to be better since the ratings are high from a large demographic of reviewers. You know how usually when you eat pizza you can just keep eating more slices, I didn't get that urge to consume more at this place. Maybe we just got a bad batch?

Well we had no choice, we had to break tradition, I mean he did drive like 8 hours just to hang out, right?

4425,"My friends and I visited Chicago from Austin last weekend.  We chose Pequod's Pizzeria based on a local's enthusiastic recommendation.  True to his assesment, the food was absolutely amazing, though one of my friends is a vegan and ordered a salad; her salad came toppped with pepparoni...something the menu didn't mention.The short, skinny waitress that waited on us didn't seem interested in sticking around to help our table, even though the place was not too busy for a Satuday lunch crowd.Overall, I would definitely recommend Pequad's to anyone,  and would love to go back next time I'm in Chicago.",5,1,positive
4426,"Went to Pequod's last week and ordered their thin crust for the first time.The pan pizza is much better, but we wanted to give their thin crust a try.  Definitely stick with the pan.  The pizza is pretty expensive, but good.  We go for the atmosphere and love their 2 people booths.  We also ordered the zucchini sticks as an appetizer, and that was a rip-off.  I agree with Frankie J., just only order the pan pizza.Their pan pizza takes a while (30-35 minutes), so if you're hungry, pre-order your pizza over the phone, and  it'll be ready for your when you sit down!",5,2,positive

Generous with the pepperoni and cheese so there's no complaints here!For people who like onion rings, they're HUGE here! This is the only place where I'll actually eat Jalapeno poppers. Their cheese bread is great too!I lovepractically everything about this place.Only downside is that service can be slow and the pizza is good but a little greasy if that's something you care about. With pizza this good, I don't!! Just blot! ;)",5,4,positive
4430,"I only order Pequod's deep-dish. It has a carmelized crust which required some getting used to, but now invokes some looking forward to.My story about Pequod's:We got completely drunk one night, had a couple people over and things got a bit chaotic. My roommates ordered a large deep-dish. During the time it took for the pizza to arrive, half the party left and the other half fell asleep (or passed out, if you will.) The pizza came, no one answered the door and the delivery guy left. We order regularly and immediately became worried about the next time we wanted some deep-dish. It's the only place we order from so thoughts raced through our minds. Will they spit in it next time? Will they put us on a black-list, a la Elaine at the chinese restaurant?Leaving nothing to chance, I ordered and had them deliver to the apartment building across the street.  It took an hour of staring out the window and some serious self-reflection time, but it arrived as planned.It's that good.",1,4,positive
4431,"BEST DEEP DISH Pizza in the whole world.... why stop @ Chicago...?I get the same toppings(mushrooms, onion and pepper) jus coz I don't think it can get better than that. I am also afraid, if it did get better, then I will become a Pequod junkie. They have a cool lunch special, personal pizza and a beverage (includes beer) for $5.99 which if you can get ur ass out during lunch hours, is totally worth the hike. We have actually taken the metra to the Clyborn station and walked 4 blocks to eat there. It's that good! Try it and u will be a believer too. :)",5,1,positive

I wouldn't call myself a snob because I'll pretty much eat any kind of pizza and release an earth-shattering belch afterward to let you, everyone in the room and everyone in a 5 block radius how good that shit was. With that said, Pequod's is one of my top 3 favorite pizza places in this city. Walking up to it, the aroma of hot salami fills your nasal cavities which makes you pray to god there's not a wait (I've only ever encountered a wait a few times). I prefer to sit upstairs in a booth, but I did get to sit at one of those tall tables in the window last week which felt pretty baller.Get the pepperoni. I don't care if you're a vegetarian or anti-peps. Give up your silly rules for one night and do yourself a life-changing favor. Indulge in some delicious red meat and burnt cheese crust. Let the hot sloppy cheese burn the inside of your mouth so bad that when you go to the dentist the next day, he asks you if you had recently eaten pizza. So, when you admit it, he can show you on that mouth cam what kind of damage it did to the inside of your mouth. WORTH IT.I take all of my out of town guests here. It's within walking distance of my apartment (dangerous) and they advertise their lunch special like whoa ($5 for a personal peetz and beer, who wants to ditch work one day and take advantage of that gem?)",15,9,positive

4441,"The pizza is good, the caramelized cheese makes it great.  It's not your typical Chicago deep dish pizza -the crust isn't dry and boring like at most of the Chicago pizza places.  The lunch special is a steal.  $5 for a personal pizza with 1 topping and 1 drink (includes beer on tap).I liked the old dining area before the renovations but there is more seating now, so I guess it's a push.  They used to show a music station on the flat tube that basically only showed videos or concert/live performance footage.  It wasn't on today.It's really easy for a dinner and movie date since the movie theater at Webster place is right across the street.5 stars for the pizza and I'd give it an extra star for Pequod's mascot - a whale wearing what appears to be a thong on its face.  If someone can explain that to me, it would be greatly appreciated.",7,2,positive
4442,"In college, I would go to a place called Papa Del's (in Champaign) for amazing deep dish pizza.  They served quality ingredients (especially the sauce....oooooh the sauce) and it was always worth the wait.  I lived in Chicago one summer and tried a bunch of deep dish pizzas (Pizzeria Due, Giordano's, Lou Milnati's, etc), but didn't like ANY of them.   Eating at all of those places seriously made me long for Papa Del's.Well, I'm out of college and I moved to New York, but whenever I visit Chicago, my friend, Brian, stuffs me with all kinds of Chicago-style food.  One place he introduced me to, Pequods, reminds me of Papa Del's, and, dare I say it, might be BETTER than Papa Del's!  They have a deep dish pizza that has a caramelized crust (they put parmesan around the crust before putting it in the oven).  The pizza has just the right amount of everything; it's not just a thin crust pizza with an inch of gloppy cheese (like SOME Chicago pizzerias).  I asked about shipping pizzas from Pequods to New York, but it was too expensive (dry ice, overnight shipping, etc)  I suppose I'll fly to Chicago anytime I have a craving :)",5,1,positive

4444,"Pizza was just good. Carmelized crust is not for me. I prefer to not cut the inside of my mouth on burnt crust that is also probably not good for you. Plus, it doesn't have much flavor. MOST importantly though: Service was horrible! With making reservations, we still had to wait 30 minutes in a crowded, horrible intersection to be seated. Then the hostess forgot she had given us a buzzer so we had to inquire after waiting 30 minutes. Usually deep dish takes 45 minutes to make; it took an hour fifteen minutes. We missed our movie. The waitress never apologized and the manager said 30 minutes to be sat (despite making a reservation) and over an hour to wait for your food (even though they tell you 45 minutes), is NORMAL at Pequods. So if you are going to see a movie or need to be anywhere allow yourself a good two and a half hours if you want to make it on time. Also the seating is very cramped. Something's gotta give. Even though the wait time and place and seating was horrible, the staff response was worse. No apologies from them. They were smug and cold. Never again. Lou Malnati's and Giordanos are sooo much better (better flavored crust) and the staff treats you like a person.",7,8,negative

Now, I have access to some of the best pizza places around: Art of Pizza, Pequod's, Pat's, and even some of the chains are way better than the cardboard I was used to eating. Anyway, my father and I got a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and fresh basil.  I mean holy shit, this stuff was great, and my dad would not shut up about it.

But, for all those places out there that claim to have Chicago style deep dish pizza, come here and be humbled. Is there better out there? Maybe, but I have yet to find it.

I was tempted on the ride home to take a bite, but I resisted.When I took a bite at home, I was speechless. The caramelized crust is ingenious and really gives the pizza a delicious and unique taste.

We have eaten (ate?) there - the place was packed and we had to wait a while for a table - I think that's normal for good food in the area.  We had a basic italian salad with dinner and it was OK, thankfully the pizza was less mediocre.We have also had take out several times.  Searching on the internet, we could find no coupons.  Sad, because that's really the best way to order take out food.",6,1,positive
4456,Wow this probably one my biggest disappointments as far as eating. I walked 3 miles here to draw up my appetite because usually my eyes are bigger than my stomach. One slice and I tapped out.

4458,"I definitely want to go back! I went in for dinner quickly before a movie across the street. We were limited in what we could order because we only had 30 minutes, and their pan pizzas take 30 minutes to bak. We got a thin crust pepperoni pizza that I thought was delicious! I prefer thin crust personally, but if we weren't so rushed I probably would have played around with the toppings a bit more. When we arrived it wasn't overly packed, but by about 6:30 there was a bit of a wait for a table. It seems like a really fun atmosphere. It's small and the furniture is old and dated like it hasn't been changed for 20 years.

Our server had a bit of an attitude, because we asked her to repeat the beer on tap, but she came around toward the end of our meal. The cheesy bread wasn't anything special, but still hit the spot. The pizza was exceptional. The buttery crust was crispy and soft and added more richness to the toppings. They pile on the pepperoni and don't skimp on fresh garlic. And they have a good selection of cold beer to wash down your piping hot pie.",10,2,positive
4465,"First of all, I went in there STARVING. There was absolutely nowhere to sit or even stand really. I think the place was just packed and people were willing to wait it out, and after I had the pizza I knew why. It was outstanding. I don't usually like deep dish because the crust can be disgusting on the inside, but this deep dish was perfectly cooked all the way through. The thin crust was just as good.I have seen people complain about the appetizers, but how can you bitch about fried vegetables and ranch dressing? Even the garlic cheese bread was awesome. 8 of us shared three pies, two app. platters, two orders of bread, and at least 4 pitchers of beer. The total with tax came out to around $18 a person. AMAZING PRICE. The service was great, once we were seated after a 45 minute wait- brilliantly the staff suggests ordering your pizza while you wait so that it will be ready when you get your table.

I decided to get a meatball parm sandwich, and I think I am still upset that I did.The meatballs were disgusting. Sure, I'm italian and so it's kind of hard to please me, because mama always wins, but these were so salty, dark dark dark brown (they even seemed old) and rubbery -- as if they had been heated up in a microwave.  There was barely any sauce on the sandwich, which is good because it tasted burnt and old.I am going to give this three stars because a piece of my friend's pizza that I had, was delicious.",4,6,negative
4470,"This is simply the best pizza anywhere.Their pan pizza really defies classification--to call it ""Chicago Style"" pizza does it a disservice:  It is no three-inch thick slab of overwhelming cheesyness topped with an anemic tomato paste.  No.  It is a superb bread to cheese to sauce ratio.  And there has been though put into how everything tastes.  The bread compliments the cheese taste which compliments the well-spiced sauce.  Many people have mentioned the caramelized crust, and it's just about perfect.I'm honestly less enamored with the thin crust pizza, but I'm not sure why anyone would come to Pequod's and get the thin crust pizza...  I feel the same way about the appetizers, but, again, if you're ruining your appetite for pizza on the appetizers that's, like, your choice, man.There is a pretty decent beer selection, and the service is fine.  Pequod's is very busy on weekend nights, so expect to wait a little while if you don't have a reservation.",6,3,positive

Best deep dish pizza I've had...but man, the other day we were in there and I was dying of a heat stroke! The weather outside was humid and about 90 degrees, inside - was almost the same. The AC of this establishment just couldn't keep up . We honestly were fanning ourselves with the menus because it was unbearable to sit and just sweat in the booth. Outside of the temperature in the restaurant, the food is fresh, hot and delicious. They are so generous with their portions of each ingredient, love that as my bf and I never can agree on the same ingredients on one pizza. I loved how friendly and accomodating the staff was. As we were about to leave to catch our movie, it started pouring rain, we were waiting inside for about 10 minutes, contemplating to run in the crazy rain to the theatre or to miss the previews...as one of the employees came up to us and gave us an umbrella that has been sitting in their lost and found for months.

4477,"Not your run-of-the-mill deep-dish experience. With it's extremely flavorful and high quality ingredients (the sauce and toppings were fantastic), and lighter, less cheese-dominated pizza, Pequod's is definitely among the best deep-dish/pan pizza's I've every had.We ordered our pizza to-go, so I can't speak for the restaurant experience Pequod's offers, but the food was delicious. We ordered both the thin crust (which was more like a regular pie than typical crispy thin crust), as well as the standard pan pizza. While both were good, the pan/deep-dish pie is what really impressed me. I don't exactly recall the toppings we ordered for the thin crust (the pan pizza was THAT good), but we ordered the pan pie with spinach, onion, basil, and garlic, which ended up being an excellent combination.Unlike some of the Chicago deep-dish staples (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, etc.), Pequod's pan pizza was fairly light on the cheese, which I felt allowed me to better appreciate the other components of the pizza (sauce, toppings, etc.). This also meant I was able to eat more, as the pizza was more bready and not nearly as heavy as that of some of Pequod's competitors.The ingredients seemed very fresh and flavorful, and the caramelized crust was a pleasant change from traditional deep dish as it was enjoyable on its own and also pretty light.The only downside about this place was the price of the pizza. After including the toppings, a medium thin crust and a large pan totaled to about $40. At the end of the day, though, the pizza was probably satisfying enough to justify the extra cost, and ended up being more than enough for four people.I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a slightly unique take on Chicago's deep-dish, and especially those looking for a lighter pizza that isn't as cheese-heavy as some of the other traditional deep-dish establishments.",22,1,positive
4478,"You know, I was skeptical about this caramelized cheese around the crust I kept hearing about, but I took my friend's advice and checked out Pequod's.  I have to say, I was totally impressed.All the tourist oriented pizza places I've ended up in Chicago.  Long lines, substandard food and high prices have been pretty depressing to me.  Pequod's had no wait, huge hdtvs everywhere and really goos pizza.  And the quality of their toppings was good too.Highly Recommended",2,3,positive
4479,"Pequod's has definitely become one of my favorite deep dish places in town.  I hear people complain about the thin crust, which I've never tried because the deep dish is so good.  The beer selection was ok, but I'm getting tired of Fat Tire, 312, and Anchor being the only Miller/Bud/Coors alternative in town.The place can be packed at times, but usually the wait isn't long - especially with the upstairs area.  The staff is always friendly and even lets you order a deep dish pizza if you are waiting.Parking though - is a pain.  A big one.  I guess that goes for most places in the neighborhood.",3,2,positive

4481,"I can't say anything that hasn't been said a million times on Yelp about Pequod's already.  Quite honestly, my favorite pan pizza in Chicago.  The crust is perfectly thick.  The sausage is my FAVORITE.  I'm quite leary about italian sausage in Chicago.  The ""layer of sausage"" at a certain pizza joint favored by concierge's all over the city that will remain nameless made me violently ill once.  Since then I am extremely picky about the sausage.Pequod's sausage is perfect.  Perfect seasoning with a slight twinge of fennel along with perfectly sized chunks.I always ask for my pie well done.  This makes the generous layer of pepperoni on top a little bit crispy.And I won't even talk about he carmelized cheese.  Its my favorite part.Pequods for life!",9,1,positive
4482,"(Morton Grove location:) Seems like a typical pizza dive joint - perfect for when you don't care what you look like and want to eat out.  I actually felt like I was back in a pub in my hometown in BFE.  The whale motif was actually kind of cool (different), even though I didn't get the Moby Dick reference until I looked it up on Wikipedia afterwards. We ordered garlic bread, which was crunchy enough to my liking, followed by a small pan pizza (I know other reviews mention deep dish, but this reminded me more of the Pizza Hut pan pizza).  The menu said the dark edges of the crust were the caramelized cheese, which sounds fantastic, but ours must have come out too burnt.  It was so black that it lost that wonderful 'burnt cheese' taste that I like.  But the black crust was my only complaint.  The sauce was rich, and there was a perfect amount of dough, cheese, and sauce.  The dough was a bit crunchy, just how I like it. I was pleasantly stuffed with a small pan pizza split between two people.  Definitely worth the stop if you lika-the-pizza.Edit: This place gets better every time I visit - I'm definitely now sold that this is some of the best deep dish on the planet (at least when your pizza comes out perfectly caramelized)!",18,3,positive

4489,"I found this spot shortly after I moved to the city and I love it!  #1 Reason I gave Pequod's 5 stars instead of 4:  Great pizza isn't hard to find in Chicago but it's the atmosphere at Pequod's that keeps me coming back.  The interior is a laid-back pub/dive bar and the music is a mix of 80s & 90s rock (like many restaurants) BUT Pequod's takes it a step further and plays the corresponding music videos on the tvs throughout the restaurant!  It's hilarious and wildly entertaining and reason enough for me to keep coming here rather than somewhere else. Haha, now that aside, on to the food:  Contrary to what one other reviewer had said I think the sauce is EXCELLENT and flavorful and you can smell it from outside the restaurant.  I suppose it is all a matter of personal opinion but I love that their pizza is more of a cross between deep-dish and pan which leaves room for more sauce, toppings and cheese than the usual 2"" thick deep-dish crust .  I might also add that the Pequod's salad is very delicious if you're looking for somewhat lighter fare.  My parents demand we go to Pequod's every time they visit now!",8,3,positive

4493,"To me, this place is unique amongst the Chicago style pizza places.  The burnt ring around the edge of the pizza really adds something different, and somehow it actually works.I've only been here for lunch.  They run a great deal at $5 for a personal size pizza and a drink.  You can even get a beer if you wish for that price.The veggie toppings I've tried have always been fresh, and I've never had a bad pizza here.  I wish it was a little closer to the ""el"" but it's worth the walk or short cab ride from the North Clybourn stop.",3,1,positive
4494,"Truly excellent pizza.The deep dish IS really bready, I admit, but it tastes so good I'll forgive them.  If someone could invent a deepdish pie that is right between Giordano's cheese soup and Pequod's bready loaf, I would be in heaven.The carmelized cheese crust is a delight, but the kicker is the toppings.  Outrageously good sausage, big honkin' slices of peppers, nothing canned or stingy about this pie.  Mmmmm.We also ordered the mostacholi with meat sauce - the noodles were a little soggy (probably because it was delivered and had to sit a little while) but was still very very tasty.",5,1,positive

The pure idea that pequods has awesome, amazing pizza with huge chunks of meat and vegetables and cheese that oozes out says tons.

4499,"As a New Yorker, I am obviously biased (or just a better judge?) but for what I consider more ""pie"" than ""pizza"", the carmelized crust does taste pretty damn good.

I haven't eaten deep dish pie anywhere else since. After I had it the first time, I had cheese, I thought wow this pizza is great. The second time I had their sausage and green pepper, even better. Since then, I have ordered it several times and it has been just as good every time. Even their delivery is excellent. The pie comes to my house steaming hot and I live in the loop, which is a fair distance from the Lincoln Park location. Anyway I can go on, but let me just say it is the BEST pizza anywhere!!

It really upsets me when you can't get a burger (or pizza) around closing time to save your life. Sometimes you need a little food to absorb all that drink.Pequod's has a cult-like following.

We open the box.  Eyes open wide, mouths salivate, and we each take a slice.After one bite- Garbo.  Simply shitty pizza.  Now this is the deep dish that I'm talking about.  And this is Chicago mind you.  You can get away with this kind of schwag in Colorado, but not in the land of pizza and hot dogs.

We had the spinach deep dish and I discovered that I would never go to Giordano's for a full deep dish pizza again. The sauce, the cheese, the caramelized crust -- everything was perfect. It particularly impressed my D.C. friends, since deep dish pizza apparently does not exist on the east coast.One thing we learned, though: don't come here and order mixed drinks. They do indeed have a full bar, but when asked what vodka they had, the waitress said ""uh, you know, like, normal vodka.""

4539,"Pizza is great, but in Chicago, many pizza's are great.  So when it comes to the difference between pizza places, service is one of the important factors to separate each place.  Service here is A-Ok but nothing more, they miss a lot of things and also mix things up by bringing wrong drinks to the table, or wrong checks, or regular coke when it should have been diet coke, things like that, no biggie.  the last few times here it happened too many times, not complaining, just weird that it happens so much.  the food is great though, and you will go back, you just deal with the mishap service; it's funny after a while. and for sure, i could use a few laughs,   I will be back again.",5,5,negative
4540,"OMG...perfect Deep Dish Pizza.  Had the sausage, pep and onions.  Buttery crust and gobs of sausage and pepperoni.  A total local hangout.  Met up with my buddy who lives in Wrigley.  What a great recommendation.",4,0,positive
4541,Not a bad place for a group if you have a reservation. I am a bit biased as I love pizza in general but this pizzeria's pizzas sure have a good crunch (the basic of a good pizza!). I also liked the ease of parking in the area (for free!) Definitely returning to try some other toppings.  Good job Pequod!,6,2,positive
4542,"I was pretty excited about getting pizza from here and we ordered the thin crust, which was probably the mistake given everyone mentioned the pan-style but I don't really care for a lot of crust in my pizza. Unfortunately, the trust was soggy and and toppings didn't blow me away. Delivery was quick. The pizza was still warm but the garlic bread was cold and I had to re-heat it. I've simply had better pizza.",5,2,negative
4543,"Their pan pizza is fantastic. Things I like about it: Focaccia-like Carmelized crust, burnt mozzarella on the ends, meatball sized sausage, large ingredients, and enough cheese and sauce to make is a chicago-styled pan pizza. The sausage may have changed a little bit when Burt sold the place. It's got a little more spice. It's seems more like an italian sausage than a more mild sausage that is signature at Burt's and other deep-dish main-stays in chicago.The restaurant has a good beer-selection-- not the best in Lincoln Park, but they have plenty of Micro-brews. The Clybourne location also has a second level so you're not going to wait long on the weekend. The main floor has plenty of TVs and has a nice renovated interior.I also like that they put a sheet of tin foil over the pizza when you get carry out. It really seems to trap in the heat. I love watching the steam come out of the box when I open it.",9,1,positive
4544,"This is one of two super favorite pizza places in the city.  I am not a huge fan of chains, so this is a great place to get great pizza, without having that chain restaurant stamp ruin the experience.  I would personally recommend the pan pizza if you go there to eat it for a meal.  Otherwise, the thin crust is a very good substitute.The service is great, and the place is quite laid back.  Another nice thing is that I don't think I have ever had to wait too long for a table, if at all.  There's also a full bar with good beers that would go really well with the pizzas.My favorite part about coming here is that I know I will have good pizza to eat the next morning, as there are always leftovers, and what good is pizza if there are no leftovers for that late night, early morning cold pizza craving!",13,2,positive
4545,"Easily my favorite pizza in Chicago. The sauce is just so savory and perfect. The crust is fantastic, and everything just goes so well together.

I am happy with canadian bacon (need a little bit of meat in my life!) with fresh spinach and extra garlic. YUM.  Even though I am a total fat kid with eating the pizza, I have to also have the Pequod's salad w/ their vinagrette dressing on the side. If you aren't up in Lincoln Park/Lakeview area... it is a haul from downtown, but worth it.  Don't do those other places that might be mentioned in your tourist guide. Trust me!  I found this place a year after I had lived in Chicago after I had sworn off deep dish pizza. My favorite meal in Chicago.  I know... I am high maintence.  : )UPDATE: I converted 2 more of my co-workers to Pequod's....heehee... its like pizza crack.",6,2,positive
4551,"Sad, I used to love Peaquod's but after my recent visit, not so much.  It's not really deep dish, more like a thicker pan.  Definitely more crust than anything, but the major disappointment was the sauce.  It was lackluster, and left a lot to be desired.  If all I wanted was a basic tomato sauce, I could have done that on my own.  Sauce definitely makes or breaks a pizza for me and this definitely left me wanting for more elsewhere.  Toppings were plentiful but again, the sauce.The place itself is huge!  Two stories that span the entire flat.  Service was friendly.  Our server was always on point when it came to making sure we were hydrated.Price-wise, a bit pricey but definitely nothing that will break the bank.",4,4,negative
4552,"Pequod's is on our list of delivery restaurants that get a ""special place"" on the fridge.  They deliver a particularly satisfying brand of pizza that is not in competition with Lou M. or Gino's -- Pequod's is in a league of their own.  The one drawback is the price.  A large deep dish pie with pepperoni (easily feeds 3 people) will run you $23 (not including the tip for delivery).",1,1,positive

4554,"Came into Pequod's with my fiancée after losing yet another softball game. We were bumming about our lack of softball prowess, and pizza heals all wounds. Pequod's has a sports bar atmosphere, a natural fit in a sporty town like Chicago, but its clear that on ""game night"" this place is going to be packed. Its a relatively small bar/restaurant, with short little booths made for two, and barstool flanked tables surrounded by Chicago sports memorabilia and flat-screen TVs. We kept it simple: soda, salad, sausage-spinach-mushroom deep dish pie. Our server brought our drinks and salads quickly; service here is brisk and friendly. The house salad was simple - chopped lettuce, sliced black olives, a slice of tomato, shredded carrots, all dressings on the side. Comforting in its simplicity. Our pizza took another 20-25 minutes, pretty standard for a deep dish place. I was hesitant about getting deep dish because I can't stand the typical heavy, buttery, pastry-dough crusts that so many Chicago-style places employ. When it came out, I saw that the cheese had oozed out onto the sides of the well-seasoned cast iron skillet, and I was briefly debating how greasy everything was going to be. But yessss...I was extremely pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the crust on Pequod's pizza! How Pequod's can take a thick layer of tangy, crunchy-on-the-bottom but light-on-the-inside crust, smother it with cheese, bright tomato sauce, and fresh spinach, herby golfball sized chunks of sausage, and fresh mushrooms and have it NOT be a belly bomb is kind of a pizza miracle. I ate two slices of medium-sized pie and felt full without that greaseball quesiness I get from just one slice of ""the other guys"" stuff. This just might be the best deep dish I've had in Chicago.Based on pizza alone this place is 5 stars. I'd happily go back and have it again and again...provided there's no game on, so I can avoid the crowds.",14,5,positive
4555,"Yes, the burnt edge on the crust is AMAZING! But I feel like the crust to topping ratio for the rest of the pizza is skewed too much to the crust side.  And I was saddened to know that the thin crust didn't have the same delicious burnt crust.  I really wish they would just bake my pizza in a super loooooong rectangular pan so there would be more of that delicious carmelized cheese or that they would combine the thin crust with the carmelized crust.  Oh well.  You can't get everything you want in life.I don't usually get a lot of toppings on my pizza and usually opt for just cheese.  However, I always get sausage and mushrooms here.  It's not the same without it.  I think the sausage helps to counteract the sauce. Yes, it's on the sweet side.  And I HATE sweet sauces.  Honestly think that Aurelio's and D'Agastino's are worse than Domino's (and I mean before they ""improved"" it) but somehow I'm ok with it here.I've never eaten here and have always done delivery or pick up.  I can only imagine it's even better fresh out of the oven.",10,1,positive

4557,"I have to admit I am not a huge fan of deep dish, and as a native Chicagoan this is kind of a sin.  My redemption came with Pequod's.  I love the carmelized crust on their pizza so much that I will eat the crusts off the leftovers before I eat the guts. I always order some of their fried zuccini with ranch dressing which is good because everything is good with ranch dressing, but still. I always used to give myself some extra time to eat at Pequod's prior to a movie at Webster Place, but now.... They deliver to Ukranian Village!!!",4,2,positive

Pequod's is the most delicious pizza i have ever had, and one of my favorite restaurants. I have tried a lot of the toppings but i go with sausage and mushroom. The sausage pieces are really big and really good. However the best part of the whole deal is the Caramelized cheese on the crust. Its scrumptious!!Being friends with a bunch of guys I eat pizza from a lot of different places.Pequod's is hands down the best pizza in Chicago.

4576,"Decent pizza but awful service. They made us wait 30 minutes even though there were a ton of tables open. They brought us upstairs to more empty tables and sat 3 of us at a small high top. We ordered a lot of food so we pulled another small table to make room since there were so many empty ones. A larger woman with a lot of star tattoos came over and said we cannot just move tables and she needs to check with the hostess to see if anyone needs the table. We said that was fine and she can take the table if it is needed. She said NO I NEED TO TAKE IT NOW and moved it away from us. We then moved to a booth and noticed no one even sat in that room with the high tops the whole 2.5 hours we were there. We asked for new plates after our salad was eaten for the pizza and she said ""ok but you have to save your forks"" in a very snotty tone. We asked if we could please have new forks and she just walked away. She came back with napkins only and said ""I guess I'll have to go clean new forks for you.""

4577,"I love Pequod's for a pre-movie (at the Webster theaters) dinner.  The thin crust is my personal favorite, partly because they leave the thicker crust around the edges so you have something to grab on to!  They're also pretty generous with the toppings.  We usually get pepperoni and green peppers and let me tell you, that thing is PACKED.The appetizers are standard, nothing especially outstanding, but my girlfriend seems to be a fan of the jalepeno poppers (I have no problem 'helping' her eat them).  Service is always pleasant and very helpful.  I don't think I've ever had to ask anyone to refill any beverage, water, soda or beer or for anything else.  That's the kind of service that makes me really want to go back.  And we do (we also order a lot of delivery...go figure).The restaurant is a little on the small side, but the wait isn't too long usually because there's a pretty good turnover, especially on a weekend night.  Two people can eat a nice dinner before a movie for less than $25 (which almost how much two movie tickets cost!!).",10,1,positive

4581,"I really wanted to like Pequod's, but I can't say that I do. Honestly, I think I would rather have the bland tourist trap pizzas (Giordano's, Gino's, and Uno) over this. Great deep dish needs a good sauce, cheese, and a good crust at a minimum. Here's why I think Pequod's is merely alright--nothing special. Pequod's sauce is pretty unremarkable, I don't think it had much of a taste quite honestly. My deep dish did not have much cheese either, considering most competitor pizzas put up to 2"" of cheese in a deep dish. Finally, my biggest complaint about Pequods is the crust! I know alot of people rave about it but I thought it was gross. This is not pizza crust, it is like a spongy cake! To me, pizza crust should be buttery and crunchy, not cake-like and bland. Oh, not to mention it looks and tastes burnt. However, Pequod's fans call it ""carmelized.""

They highly suggest that you order your pizza while you are waiting so it is ready when you sit down. Yeah that didn't work either. We waited another 30 min. for our pizza. The pizza was just ok. The sauce had no flavor and it was mostly doughy not cheesy. To top of the aggravation of the wait, the service was terrible. Our server seemed aggravated when we asked for water.

I have read that some people think they have too much crust, but I disagree. It's delicious and the way it is served, each piece remains hot. Another thing, Pequod's is so reasonably priced.

4592,"Pequod's Pizzeria was nothing terribly exciting. I've had several other Chicago deep dish pizzas, and while the flavor was good, I can't say the value is truly there. Why? Because it's pricey for what is essentially a loaf of dough and a tiny amount of sauce and toppings.If you're in the area in search of pizza, it might be worth trying, but be prepared to wait - the place was PACKED when we went to pickup the pie. Well, I should say, both times we went, since the erroneously gave us a sausage and green olives pizza (ew?) instead of sausage and green peppers.They fixed the order and had a new one ready in 20 minutes, but we had to come back with the botched pizza.

I do like their pizza I just can only eat one slice.. I'm more of a thin crust pizza and I know they have it but usually we go there for the deep dish. The service is good and they have dr. pepper!!,5,0,negative
4598,Omg this is the best pizza I have ever had!! I have been here a few times before and whenever I'm in Chicago I come here. Both deep dish and thin crust are amazing and they deliver till 3 in the morning which is awesome. I have been to other pizza places in Chicago but nothing beats pequods.,3,0,positive
4599,"My Dad and I decided to take a trip up to watch our beloved Cardinals take on the Cubs and check out a pizza joint. After looking on Yelp, we decided that Pequod's would be the place to go. After having Pizzeria Uno taken from us here in St. Louis, we were itching for a solid deep dish. WOW! This place is amazing! The price was just right and next time I go with one other person, I'll still get a large because it was great to bring back home. I've already recommended it to anyone and everyone that lives/visits Chicago. I'll be back!",6,0,positive
4600,"Best pizza ever! I have all my out of town friends and family hooked on this.  Every time they come to see me, we always have to go to pequods.  Make sure you order the deep dish, though.  Otherwise, you may not get the full pizza bliss experience.",1,0,positive

It was busy, but we didn't have to wait long for a table. I really want to try the salad next time because someone at a table next to us had one and it looked delicious.  Also tried the mozzarella sticks, but they were pretty much standard. The other times, I have gotten delivery and it takes sort of awhile (45-hour) but the pizza arrives hot and fresh.The pizza. Obviously got the pan pizza.  I don't really like the bottom part of the crust, it's a little dry.  The caramelized cheese part was delicious and so were the sauce and cheese.  Peqoud's is definitly one of my top three pizzas of Chicago!",9,0,positive
4603,"Greasy, tons of toppings... hot heaping mounds of delicious-ness.  This is what Chicago-style pizza is supposed to be.  It seems a bit expensive ($20s for a pie) but if you can finish more than 2 slices of a large you're more of a man than I am.I highly recommend pep/mush combination... they cover the pizza with so many toppings you almost forget there's 5 pounds of cheese underneath.Delivery has always been quick and friendly.  Pizza always shows up hot.Cool point - reheats VERY well in the oven.  Which is good, because my 2 roommates and I were never able to finish a large.",5,1,positive
4604,"Reasons why I'm in love with Pequod's:1. The atmosphere--this place has a real pizzeria feel, right down to the brick walls, the wooden booths, the TVs in every corner, and the little waitresses yelling out to the bartender ""TWO DIETS"" in a tubular Chicago accent whenever we asked for a refill on our pops.2. The people--this place is NOT pretentious. You won't find any yuppies or business suits here. The crowd is friendly, laid-back, and comfortable in their jeans and tee shirts. Another plus is that it's a little bit off-track from the typical tourist-destination Chicago pizza joints, so I don't see that many touristy family excursions here too often.3. The pizza--It's better than Giordano's, but then again, most pizzerias are. (Oh yeah, I just went there. ) The pan pies are fantastic. The dough actually has flavor, and then of course, there's that carmelized cheese. It may not be the best pizza you've ever encountered in your life (or maybe it is!), but it damn sure will come close. One downside to Pequod's--no free refills! I know, I know. What is this, like, 1876? Who doesn't give free refills nowadays? The first time that happened to me at Pequod's, I wound up ringing up a tab of $16 just on diet pepsi refills alone! Criminy!",10,3,positive
4605,"What's better on a Friday night!!  Beer and the best pizza in Chicago!!!!A friend was visiting from out of town and the Chicagoan's of the group all choose Pequod's.  Very easy to make a reservation, however, since they've remodeled the newer place has alot more seating.  Pitchers of beer were affordable, large pan pizza was to die for, and a medium thin crust was actually kinda gross.  I would not opt to get that at all.  Also, the garlic cheese bread was yummy too!All together the bill ended up being less than $17 per person!  Great dinner choice!!",4,2,positive
4606,"After all of the hype, I finally had Pequod's for the first time last night. (Thanks to grub hub, I discovered they deliver to my place!) The pizza was absolutely amazing. We got plain cheese and I wish I was still eating it right now! That caramelized cheese is to die for! I love cheese on anything and everything and the crust is no exception. The pizza was ready and delivered in an hour which is better than other local places I've tried.If you're looking for delicious pan pizza, Pequod's has to be one of the best in Chicago!",7,2,positive
4607,"Like Cristin M. I did not know going in that pan was ""the thing"". I really don't see how that could have made me like this pizza though. I ordered a small thin crust pizza with ground beef, basil, and mushroom. The ground beef was not GROUND. They should have called it meatball pizza. In addition, the meat tasted like crap. I ended up picking it all off just to make the pizza edible. And basil? Please, there was hardly any in there! Even that couldn't add flavor to the lackluster sauce on this pizza. It tasted no better than Chef Boyardee. Really!I came over here for the first time after a killer kickboxing session at Bally's across the street. (I know, counterproductive.) I had hardly had a bite all day and I was starving. I also wanted to catch the Monday Night Football game. Pequod's had the game on, but the volume was so low you could barely hear the commentary. Come on; this is a casual pizza joint. Turn up the volume!! The service was good enough, but was the pizza?This Pequod's reminds me of an alt-pizza joint. Like you have to be wearing a goofy winter hat, be a man with crazy long hair, or be wearing skinny jeans to really fit in. Funny, cute, and adds to the stlye and originality of the place. Maybe next time I stop in I'll get the pan pizza, add garlic and gardinera for a flavor boost and ask them to TURN UP THE GAME!",8,5,negative
4608,"I've been to Pequod's many many times - enough to write a fair review.  I give their deep dish pizza at least 4 to 5 stars because it's hand's down a delicious pizza.  Their crust is amazing (it's a little burnt with a nice carmalized crunch - just the way I love it!).  The host and the service, now that is a different rating all together - I give the service two stars and the host zero stars.  Their pizza is definitely better than Giordano's or Gino's East.  I keep going back because I love the pizza - that is the only reason.  The host is a complete joke.  One time we got there on a Saturday night and gave the host our name for the wait list.  Shortly after, he began seating five groups that arrived after us.  I was very upset because my group only consisted of two people, so I said something and he kept mumbling some ridiculous excuses that didn't make sense.  We waited for an hour and twenty minutes before he sat us.  I no longer go there at nights on the weekends - it's a nightmare to get seated and the service is extremely slow (you will wait for over an hour to be seated).  One time we waited an hour and twenty minutes for our pizza to arrive at our table - of course, it was cold.  It must have been sitting in the kitchen the entire time.  Also, the waitresses seem to be really slow.  I must say that they offer a sensational lunch special for five bucks - which I highly recommend.  As you can see, I have mixed review about this place, but I keep going back because the pizza is my favorite.   I am willing to tolerate the obnoxious host (the skinny guy with glasses) and the slow service just to take a bite of their delicious deep dish pizza!",13,8,positive

4622,"Since I've relocated from upstate New York to Chicago one of the consistent questions I get from friends and family has been ""how's that great Chicago pizza"". Unfortunately I haven't been able to answer it with enthusiasm. I've tried the places that people rant and rave about; Gino's East, Giordano's, Pizano's, Pieces and a few others. While none of them were disappointing, they didn't live up to the expectations of Chicago pizza. I thought maybe that the great Chicago deep dish was a myth, something we New Yorkers had made up. Then I found Pequod's Pizzeria. Now that's some Chicago deep dish pizza!Pequod's has a very unassuming location on the 2200 block of North Clybourn. The seating area appears clean and tidy, but reminds you more of a bar than it would a pizzeria. The staff there is friendly and courteous, greeting and seating us the minute we stepped in. They even offered us better seating in the rear to get away from the cold air coming in as patrons entered and exited the restaurant. They serve both deep dish and thin crust pizzas in small, medium and large sizes (10"", 12"", 16"") along with an array of appetizers. They offer an assortment of toppings but this being my first adventure I decided to stick with the tried and true topping of pepperoni. While we waited, a couple next to us was putting a hurting on a medium pizza that looked really good. They overheard us talking and piped in with ""This is going to be the best pizza you've had in the city"". High praise but I had heard it all before.The pizza came out and it looked absolutely delectable. The first thing I noticed is that the edge of the pizza appeared to be darkened, almost like it had been burned. The waitress assured me that it was perfectly normal due to their famous ""caramelized crust"". I dove in and it was heaven. For those of you who like Gino's East, this is basically Gino's pizza with a helping of perfection added in. It has a very similar cornmeal like crust to the pizza, but it doesn't seem to taste as strong, which is a good thing. The pizza is very saucy, like Gino's, but not to the point where it's incredibly messy. The pepperoni was cooked exactly how i like it, where it's a bit crispy, but not burned. The portions were a good size as well. A small pizza split between two people should be enough for most, although if you want leftovers you may want to go with a medium.All that being said, Pequod's has been the best pizza experience I've had since moving to Chicago. Now when friends and family come to visit, I know exactly where to take them. If you're in the neighborhood I would suggest stopping in. There's a Kerasotas movie theatre right across the street as well, easily making a night of it if you're not close by.",32,7,positive

4628,"i wish there were separate ratings for food and service. the food was great. the service...well, the service left an amazing amount to be desired.i suppose to should say that it was the ending service, the girl in the blackhawks jacket, that came from behind the bar and in one fail swoop ended an affiliation i will ever have with the restaurant.  my best friend hosted a birthday party for her daughter and at the end, we all felt that we were really being rushed out of the party room. my boyfriend went to use the restroom and came back to find his beer gone. now that ordinarily is just cause for annoyance...however, we had been making trips up and down the back steps to load gifts and decor into the car. please note that we had done this same thing bringing the decor in and the only people who doing this were the friends of the parents who were trying hustle getting things out since, as i mentioned before, we were already being rushed. upon our, literally, last trips (there were 4 of us) down the steps to take the final things down. we were told we could not use the steps. it was a little confusing, as we had been using them for a half hour and had used them to bring everything in.but as we were walking the final things down, the dark haired girl in the blackhawks jacket sang down the steps ""well, just wait until you try to come back in and youre locked out"" meanwhile, my boyfriend was sitting upstairs and overheard her telling another server triumphantly, ""well, just wait until they try to get back in, i've locked the doors and they are just going to have to deal with it."" i'm not certain what rules we were breaking, as we had been using the doors several times. i'm also not certain why it mattered, it's a straight shot down and saved us from walking repeatedly through the entire busy restaurant with armloads of gifts and decor. however, what really was perplexing was the attitude of this dark haired bartender in the blackhawks jacket. it was as though she was happy to have caused us additional problems. as though someone who had just paid the bill for pizza and beers for a party of roughly 50 would not merit some polite consideration. at the time, we were so busy getting the cars and the kids loaded that no one had time to deal with the rudeness of the girl in the blackhawk jackets, but it was decided that we would never return there. If we were in the wrong, then we would apologize, however, to be treated so incredibly rudely for merely trying to do accommodate the feeling of being pushed out of the room quickly is insanely poor customer service and to be ""proud"" of causing your clients extra problems is indicative of someone who should NOT work in the service industry.",13,8,negative
4629,In top contention for my favorite pizza in Chicago. My norm is the pan pizza with black olives and green peppers. With their pan pizzas I always find the thickness of the dough to take away from the overall flavor. But it is all worth it when you make it to the crust. Amazing!,3,1,positive
4630,"In a city full of awesome pizza joints, Pequod's easily holds its own.  What makes it so good is that it is completely different from other pizzas in town.  The standard Pequod's pie falls somewhere between the ubiquitous Chicago deep-dish and the standard delivery fare.  The crust is thick, but light and buttery, the sauce is substantial, but not too sweet, and the burnt, crispy cheese hugging the crust is a thing of beauty.  Sure, once you knock down a couple slices, you'll feel like an aggressive baby is trying to punch his way out of your stomach.  But I'm a firm believer that sometimes you need to suffer for your food.",5,3,positive

We ordered 4 large pizzas for the group with a variety of toppings, and it was more than enough. The pizza was delish, although I thought for deep dish pizza the toppings were underneath the sauce, but here they put them on top. The crust is the real deal here. They bake it in a cast iron pan, and the crust is perfectly done. I also had deep dish pizza again on my trip, and I found that I liked the inside of the pizza better elsewhere, but this place is definitely worth trying. They also have good local beers here, so make you sure you try some of those!",8,0,positive
4660,"I tried Pequod's for the second time last night.  It's good. Yes, it's good.but.It's not great. The crust is fantastic. but.Those last few bites are immensely enjoyable. The caramelized/burnt cheese crust is everything an aspiring pizzeria should strive for however the rest of the crust had a pretzel-y flavor to it.  Not the flavor intensive crust edge that this place is supposedly know for.The ingredients are good.But.They are not of the highest quality.  Minimal spinach. Half ripe tomatoes.  The sauce has an almost processed tasted to it.  There was not any real essence of Italian seasonings, olive oil or the like.  The sausage chunks are great however. Large, liberal sausage. That's how it should be. The cheese is quite delcious too.  Lots of cheese.  If you are eating deep dish you need lots of cheese and they did not disappoint.My largest concern is the price they charge for this average pie.  For a large pan, 3 ingreidient + delivery it cost around $31 dollars.  For $31 I could have orderded a LouMals (The BEST deep dish in Chicago...This is fact...do not argue this for I will find you do bad things).Delivery was the standard hour wait from most respectable pie joints in the city.All this being said...I will say... this is my 2nd favorite deep dish in the city.  Better than Art of Pizza...and better than the conglomerate Giordano's machine. Much better than Uno's (duh).  In line with Gino's. Did I miss any heavy hitters?  I am thinking back on this review and decided on another star. so there.",10,2,negative

4662,So f'ing good. It's not chicago style deep dish. It's pan pizza. So delicious. I recommend eating there instead of getting carry out if you don't live in the neighborhood. The crust gets a bit soggy after a 30-min door to door transport. This is one of my favorite places for pizza.,4,0,positive
4663,"As someone who's born and raised in Chicago, I'm surprised that so many people like this place.  I feel like I'm eating bread covered with tomato sauce and a tiny bit of cheese. Yuck. Definitely wayyyy more places I'd rather eat then pizza from this place.",2,0,negative
4664,"Forget Gino, Giordano, and any other deep dish pizza place... you'd just be wasting your time.Pequod's is the best Chicago-style deep dish in the city, no question about it.Delivery can take 1+ hour which can be frustrating, but the wait is worth it.",2,2,positive

4666,After getting a tip off on yelp about this place I decided to try it.  We ordered the deep dish pizza and I guess you need to order taste on the side.  The pizza tasted like bread with sauce (as if the sauce was water).  There are other pizza spots that are better and closer to the city-city.,2,0,negative
4667,"This is the BEST deep dish pizza in Chicago. I am not a sauce person, but this sauce is crazy good. The crust is so good and caramelized. Delivery sometimes takes 2 hours. Pick up is about 1 hour. So if you are starving beware about the wait. This place gets very busy. I have been coming here for 12 years and their deep dish has never changed. It is always the same delicious pizza. Best in Chicago. If you have not gone here you have definitely not tried the best Chicago deep dish",4,2,positive
4668,"We will NEVER go back!  So this is the second year in a row that I had a decent sized group go to Pequods to celebrate my birthday.  Last year, although I had called to confirm my reservation numerous times, they did not have enough seats for my whole party, nor would they have even been able to fit everyone at one table, so part of my group had to be separated.  A booth opened nearby, so it wasn't the end of the world.  For some reason we decided to go back again this year (probably just because pizza is an easy thing to deal with for a big group to share).  Again, I had called numerous times to confirm everything with our reservation to ensure we did not encounter any problems.  I was assured everything was ready.  We got there early/on time for our 8:00 reservation, and were told that there was another party seated where they were planning on seating us, and we'd have to wait for them to leave.  There were 10 of us waiting around and it was HOT and CROWDED.  There was nowhere for us to stand and they apparently did not know how to regulate the temperature in the restaurant.  FINALLY, after waiting 45 minutes after our reservation time, we were seated (probably because after 35 minutes I finally asked the party that was at 'our table' if they would be leaving any time soon, which I would NEVER normally do, but at that point we were pretty hungry and pretty pissed, and the manager clearly wasn't going to do anything about it).  All of that being said, I understand sometimes things like that happen, but ALWAYS when I've been in a situation along the lines of the restaurant screwing something up, they've tried to do something to accommodate us.  This manager (Sean) only offered to pick up the tab on ONE pitcher of beer (again, there were 10 of us who had waited 45 minutes for our table, plus another 20 for the pizzas we had pre-ordered), and even that was only after I had asked him to do something for us.  Seriously? The best you could do is one pitcher of beer for a party of 10 people?? Pathetic.I will say that I actually felt bad for the waitress.  She was VERY nice and I wish her all the best in finding a much better place to work than Pequod's, as I can't begin to comprehend why she (or anyone else for that matter) would want to work there.In any case, we will NEVER go back to Pequod's after that AWFUL experience.  There is MUCH better pizza out there with MUCH better restaurant management.",17,1,negative

After my Lou Malnati's experience i am now obsessed with deep dish pizza.  we ended up here at 6pm on sunday night and had no wait.  The only bad part about deep dish is having to wait for your pizza to get cooked (about 30+ minutes).  however, it was worth it.

I know a few people who love this pizza, however it is really not one of my favorites. The crust is more of a corn bread type crust, and just doesn't suit my fancy. The sauce, the toppings, everything else about the pizza was good. I have had a meatball, as well as a sausage from Pequods and they were terrific. Would return for a sandwich and a beer!",5,1,negative
4675,I went there with the Windy City Pizza Club.  The crust delivered its well known taste but I thought the medium pan was a little heavy on the sauce compared to what I remember the last time I went there.  Prices were very reasonable.

4676,"Without repeating too much that has already been said, the choices here for deep dish are amazing.

I recommend getting garlic on your pizza it adds a little kick!,5,1,positive
4679,Far out man!  Their deep dish pizza is amongst the greats in the biz.  Super filling slices of all the good ingredients you could possibly want.  The intentionally burnt back crust trumps any pizza innovation that the mad scientists at pizza hut or dominos could ever come up with.,2,0,positive

4682,"Everyone says that their pizza is one of the best, so I decided to give it a shot. While it wasn't disappointing, I was certainly not impressed. The pan pizza was a bit too doughy for my tastes. To me, Pequods is a place that gets more credit than it deserves because A. It is in a great area, and B. the people who go there are transplanted Chicagoans who have yet to have a great pizza.",4,1,negative
4683,"This is my favorite pizza joint.  Being from the east coast, I don't love deep dish, and theirs is a little different than others I've tried here; less heavy, and tastier.  On weekends they will let you make a reservation, but it doesn't get you a table right away.  You just get priority over the people who have just walked in.  But you can put your pizza order in while you wait since it takes so long to cook anyway.Side note, I chose this as my last solid meal before getting my wisdom teeth out!  Must be my favorite meal!",6,0,positive

4685,"The first time I ate Pequod's was when we had staff meeting at a clinic I used to work at.  At first, I was wondering what the char was on the crust (I'm not questioning why, but what is it?).  My boss said it was cheese, and that made it even better.  Their pizza was very unique, thin crust attributes (""accidental caramel crust"", loaded looking) with the appeal of a stuffed pie (the more to love deal).  It was good, good enough to realize that I sometimes forget that it was a deep dish.  However, to me, the only thing that really got me interested in their pizza was the crust.  The cheese peeled/fell off often, that forced me to reset most of the pizza back on the crust.  And because of caramelizing, the crust was very soggy underneath.  Either way, interesting concept, tasty, but hard to overlook the flaws when you actually eat it.",8,3,positive

4687,"Wow, what a difference a few years makes.  This pizza, frankly, stinks.  If there was cheese on this pizza, I couldn't find it.  Here's the ratio: 96% bread, 3% sauce, and 1% toppings.  Excluding cheese.  Just...wow.  So not good.  I like the caramelized crust.  I'll give Pequod's that crust, but nothing else.  I just can't get behind a deep dish pizza that has no cheese on it.  (And I hasten to add that we ordered a straight-up cheese pizza, and one that was half cheese, half mushroom.  More like half mushroom, half nothing but sauce.)  People love this stuff, and I mean....why?  Maybe they don't like cheese anymore.",6,1,negative
4688,"Pequod's wins first place in mediocrity!

4689,"Okay, it's great that this place serves pizza and beer late night and service is stellar.  But I can get over the fact that the pizza was below average in taste.  I think we ordered a pan pizza, which had 2 inches of dough, topped with sauce, then the meat.  It looked great, but tasted like pizza your mom made when you were a kid.",4,0,negative
4690,I've not ordered deep dish pizza in a very long time.  My experience was that there was more ingredients and cheese- this particular deep dish was more pizza dough- I mean way too much dough.  So it's definitely back to thin crust for me and I've found that the best thin comes from Johns pizzaria on western ave.,1,0,negative
4691,"I was under the impression that I didn't like deep dish pizza, until I had it at Pequod's. Definitely a great place to bring out of town visitors who want to try out Chicago's best deep dish! I'm sure I'll be doing so a lot in the future.",3,0,positive
4692,"Pequod's Pizza sets the standard for deep dish pizza in Chicago, as far as I'm concerned. I've tried other, perhaps more iconic, pizzas, and they do not compare. The taste and texture of the crust, the quality and quantity of the toppings - there is nothing left to be desired. The venue itself is usually crowded, and perhaps not family-oriented (their sign and t-shirts feature a whale with a thong on its head, though my somewhat tight-laced parents didn't mind), but it's perfectly possible to get a table with little notice given.",1,2,positive

4697,"Pequod's has a very strange logo and a pretty good deep dish pizza.  They definitely go lighter on the toppings and heavier on the sauce, but the carmelized crust offsets that to make a darn good pizza.  It's also fairly easy to get a table here, most people seem to leave quickly after seeing a crowded front room not realizing there's far more space upstairs.  Also, they deliver during lunch on weekdays, unlike the Lou Malnati's on Wrightwood.  Definitely a bit expensive for what you're getting in my opinion, but the carmelized crust is unique enough that it's good to go Pequod's every once and a while.",8,3,negative

The frustrating part was after waiting 45 mins, we had to wait another hour for the pizza to come.  We also got wedged in an uncomfortable booth in the back corner which was hot and had a pipe above is that was dripping water the whole time. Yes. The pizza was great. But the experience was not. To top it all off, the place is understaffed so it took 10 mins to get someone's attention to get and extra set of silverware, 30 mins to have someone get our check, 15 mins to run the credit cards, etc etc. Very frustrating.

4725,"Before I moved to Chicago, I had visited the city as a tourist and not knowing any better had waited in line for over 90 mins for pizza at UNO just off the mag mile. The pizza was good, but it isn't hard to find good pizza in Chicago. It isn't even difficult to find great pizza in Chicago. However, if you're looking for that slice made from flour,yeast, and god's breath, go to Pequod's. It all starts with the divine crust, the true foundation of any pizza. Theirs is deep dish, black around the edges, not burnt; caramelized. Yum, drool. They top it with super fresh veggies and meats. I'm fairly certain they make their own sausage, which is often the case with the best pizza houses. If you're finicky, you probably won't like this place. If you love exploring the best food, (not necessarily the most expensive or the most popular in your tour book) go here. If all this doesn't convince you, let me add that they usually have a good selection of local and/or craft beers on tap. Good beer and amazing pizza wins this girl's heart every time.",17,4,positive
4726,"I've been to Pequod's SO many times since we discovered it, it's ridiculous. We always get their deep dish pepperoni and every single time it's been delicious and perfect. I LOVE the caramelized cheese at the crust part. Not only is their pizza amazing, there is also something special about their Blue Moons on tap. I've tried other Blue Moons at various bars, but theirs is so tasty and rich (no clue why). You HAVE to try their Blue Moons. It can get pricey though (~$6/beer?).

4728,I was there last night with a rather large group of people 20-25 and they were very accommodating. We had called in advance and they reserved this whole section for us. Their pan pizza was delicious and their staff was good.  Ps thier crust really is the deal! Pizza is a bit doughy but its still freaking good,3,1,positive
4729,"Pequod's was ok. I noticed it while sitting in a bookstore across the street, and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was fun - both booths and tall tables to choose from. The service was also quick, attentive and polite. They had a good beer selection as well. I was disappointed by their pan pizza, however. It was advertised by Pequod's and by readers on yelp as a 'deep dish' pizza. However, I found that the only thing deep about it was the crust - there was a lot of bread with very little cheese and marinara on top (not what I've come to expect from a deep dish). Also, the veggies on top did not look or taste fresh, although a second pie with only cheese tasted a bit better.",9,1,negative
4730,"This is the first place I've ever had deep dish pizza from, so I have literally nothing else to compare it to, but I can honestly say that it's the best pizza I've ever had. The cheese on the edges is delicious and caramelized, the toppings were amazing (mushrooms, sausage, black olives), the cheese on top was perfect, and the whole thing was just delicious. I'm a pretty big guy and two slices off the media pizza had me stuffed, and that's even after I ate lightly all day in anticipation for this Chicago gem. The crust is also perfectly crispy, which is just how I like my pizza. Absolutely wonderful.",11,0,positive
4731,"Easily my favorite pizza in all of Chicago.  The bar is nice, and they have a great lunch special that includes a small pizza and a beer.  How can you beat that?  It is hard to get to by public transit, so I usually drive, and parking is ok in the area.  When I get it delivered, they usually arrive within an hour and the pizza is always still hot.",4,1,positive
4732,"I ordered the thin crust last night, while the toppings (Sausage and Mushroom) were delicious, i wasn't overly impressed.  The outter pieces were must better than the ""inner"" ones as the crust wasn't even substantial enough to stay together-it fell apart quite easily.  After reading all the reviews I'll opt for the deep dish next time.",4,1,negative
4733,I've been living in the area near peaquod for about 6 months now. I am so glad that there is a good pizza place in walking distance. Peaquod's is my top two favorite pan pizzas.

4734,"Visiting Chicago with my daughter, I decided we needed to try some authentic deep dish Chicago Pizza. Pequod's seemed like the best place, only a 15 minute cab ride from where we were, and a lot of Great reviews on Yelp.   We arrived about 6:15 on Tuesday 8-5-2014. Its a Bar/restaurant. We walked in and were taken upstairs immediatly. They only had two soups, so we both ordered the Mushroom soup. For pizza we ordered deep dish with extra cheese, mushrooms and pepperoni. The mushroom soup came very quickly. It was good, nothing to rave about. I've had better, but I've had a lot worse. The pizza took a little while to arrive, but our waitress warned us. If you are getting fresh, deep dish pizza, you should expect it to take a while. It arrived and it was good. Now I am a Big Fan of Deep dish pizza, so I have tried a lot. Pequod's pizza is very good, but again, nothing memorable. The crust was overly cooked, a bit too burned and crispy for my daughter and I. We have a pizzeria in the Detroit area called Pizza Papalis, that is my all time favorite. It takes almost an hour to get your pizza and its made with several kinds of cheese's and has a crust that you will swear, comes out of a bakery.Pizza Papalis is what I judge all other deep dish pizza by. Pure heaven!  I have to say Peguod's got an extra star from me for their incredible service. Three people ""tag teamed"" our table. Rushing over food, picking up and dropping off plates and refilling outr water glasses. Their service was exceptional. Got us in and out in a hurry, but we didn't feel rushed in the least. I would say Pequod's is worth a visit, if you want good pizza and Great service!",15,3,positive
4735,I was a little worried about moving away from my traditional pizza joints when I ordered from Pequods the first time....but that quickly went away when i tasted my first bite of this most tasty treat!  I love the pizza here and it has quickly become my favorite in the city!  Nothing better than a pepperoni pan pizza with that delicious caramelized crust!!!!  MMMMM!,4,1,positive
4736,"Think thick crust with a layer of cheese, toppings, and sauce on top.  This is not like a Lou's or Uno's, but something a little different.  Great crust.  I read about the caramelized crust edges and I immediately became a fan.  We went early on a Saturday and were ushered up stairs.  The upstairs had all of the young families and was a bit loud with the kids running around.  I wish this place delivered to me.",2,0,positive

4744,"This is my favorite pizza place in the Chicago area. Exclamation mark!I'm a suburbanite, but I don't mind driving out to the city and waiting for a table to eat here. Speaking of which, if you come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to WAIT. So worth it though... Believe me. Nice thing is you can order your pizza when you put your name on the list for a table, and when you are seated you don't have to wait very long for your pizza. When I come here, I usually stick to 1 - 3 toppings max. The perfect pizza for me is pepperoni and maybe fresh basil. The cheese and caramelized crust is the star of the show, so I try and keep it simple as to not detract from that. One thing I don't get is the mascot? A whale with a thong on it's head??? No clue... Two of the servers I spoke with couldn't really explain it either. Seriously, if you haven't been checked out Pequods you are definitely missing out.

The atmosphere was nice, easy to hear the people next to you, but the lighting could have been a little better. The menu was not as big as I expected for this being a very well known pizza establishment. The pizza was very good, (I had a thin crust with vegetables) but the service was terrible. We ordered our food and after awhile we asked the waitress how much longer it would be till we were served. She went to go check and then told us that there was a mix-up in the kitchen and that we would have to wait a few more minutes... we were starving at this point so not words we wanted to hear. Overall, I would go back but maybe not at a busy time of the day.",5,1,positive

4759,"A few months ago, I might have given four or five stars, but I've been pretty disappointed with Pequod's lately. I'm more of a fan of the thin crust pizzas here, although the ""carmelized"" cheese (aka burnt) on the deep-dish is interesting. That said, my two most recent orders were for a simple thin-crust sausage pizza. I used to be obsessed with the sausage they used because it was big hunks of REAL fennel-loaded Italian sausage, rather than those little round pellets of kibble that pass for sausage at the bulk of pizza places. But my last two pizzas just don't taste the same as the pizza I once loved. I thought my last order in which the sausage and spices on the pizza tasted a little off was a fluke, so I gave it another try. I'm not sure if they've switched sausage or altered the spices in the sauce or what, but it just isn't as good as it used to be. Also, I opened the box to find the cheese so runny that half of the ingredients of the pizza had slid to one side, which is annoying to say the least.I figure I've been a good enough customer and they've been reliable in the past so I plan to give them one more shot, although I'll stay away from the sausage. If my next pizza has the same iffy flavor as my past two, I'm thinking a decrease in stars might be in order.Caveat: When you order over the phone and pay with a credit card, they tend to write your entire card number, security code and ZIP code on the yellow carbon receipt stapled to the bag or box, so you might want to be sure to shred that baby before you throw it out.",7,2,negative

4780,"First of all, Pequod's serves the best pizza I've ever had- in Chicago or anywhere.  The caramelized crust (it's not burnt, people) on the deep dish pizza is what makes them unique so don't even think about ordering thin crust.  Also, if it is your first time, you'll want to go in and try it fresh, not delivered. It is worth pointing out that the Pequod's deep dish is different from other ""chicago-style"" pizza like Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's.  This isn't stuffed pizza, it is more traditional- but again, it's all about the crust.  For me, nothing beats the topping combination of pepperoni and pepperoncini.  They smother the pie with toppings so I don't recommend going crazy with a lot of different toppings.  The restaurant itself can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends.  If you have a large party, be sure to make a reservation.  You can also place your order while you wait since it takes about 30 minutes to cook.

4783,I am a firm believer that dinning at a restaurant is more than about just the food. It is an experience and for that I am giving Pequod's a bad review. The food itself was good although certainly not the best pizza in Chicago. The reason I probably will never go back was the service. I arrived at this establishment on Saturday night and as expected there was a line. I asked for the wait time and was told 45 minutes. That's a long time but this restaurant's notoriety preceded it and I was willing to wait and wait I did. After an hour I asked approximately how much longer the wait would be and I was told 15-20 minutes. Feeling very discontent but understanding that the majority of the laborious task of waiting was already completed I opted to stay. Wait...Wait...Wait...I ended up waiting for almost two hours. Was the host appoligetic? No. Was the owner? No. Did the waitress blame us when our pizza which we had preordered was late? YES! It's unfortunate that I had such a bad experience as I had heard a lot about this restaurant and it was a letdown to be so disappointed. There's better pizza and service out there.

I did not receive an apology for the wait, or the fact that I received a drink with a mysterious object floating in it.The quality of the pizza was sub-par at best. The sauce is too sweet and there is way too much of it.  There was also way too much crust which took away from the taste.  I had heard raves about the ""caramelized"" crust, but I was not at all impressed.  It' taste was a  mixture of tasteless dough and burned dough.My experience was enough to convince me to not return.",4,3,negative
4790,"Probably the best deep dish in the city, the caramelized crust makes it that much more amazing.  I feel like it's always packed in there, so you have to be sure to make reservations, especially for a larger group.  They always have good beers on tap and the staff is always friendly.",5,0,positive
4791,"Caramelized cheese crust, so freakin good. My favorite pizza in Chicago - I recommend the deep dish with pepperoni and pepperoncini. Thin is still good, but the deep dish is what you need to get. Plus it's deep dish that isn't solid cheese (ie Gino's), so you're not quite as full after you eat it.",5,0,positive
4792,"If you're bored with Uno's/Due's, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's, Edwardo's, etc. then I suggest going here.  Pequod's is excellent.  I like how there's so many opinions on what good Chicago pizza is.  Other smaller cities would be lucky to have this kind of debate.",4,1,positive
4793,I was so so disappointed when I got tried Pequod's for the first time this week. I was really craving cheesy deep dish pizza that was new to me so I came on yelp and saw all the great reviews. The pizza was delivered and got here fast enough. I don't like that the pizza is basically all crust. Most deep dishes have a good percentage of topping and crust. But my pizza wa 90% crust...yuck!! I was just very disappointed and won't be ordering from here again!!,5,3,negative
4794,"The very true test of a great pizza, like love,  is the morning after.  Pequod's gets my highest pizza rating and this ol' Taylor Street gal knows her pizza.   I thought it was one of the best ever and the crust was not only pretty but crunchy.  Whole family loved it - Don't know why we never tried it before as we pass by there all the time.  Thanks to the Pizza god above for my daughter's maturing taste buds, and delivering us from the evil taste of Domino's.  Amen.",6,1,positive
4795,"Don't get me wrong, this is far better than Domino's or Pizza Hut.  But in a town where you have delicious thin and thick-crust pies, Pequod's just doesn't cut it.  They are most known for their thick crust pizza, which has a layer of burnt cheese around the crust.  That's a nice touch, but it's not enough to offset the mediocre sauce and too-thick bottom crust.  Again, you won't hate Pequods, but there's just no real reason to go.",4,2,negative
4796,"Unlike most of the reviews of this place, I am reviewing the thin crust pizza instead of the pan.  The thin crust is very good--not too crackery, with just the right bit of chewiness.  The toppings are yummy and plentiful, and the sausage and mushroom combo is my favorite.  What's weird though, is that Pequod's is the ONLY pizza I've ever eaten that I add salt to.  One would think that between the cheese, sausage, and pepperoni it would be almost too salty, but no!  Bizarre, but true for me every time I've had it.",4,1,positive
4797,"**UPDATE**I took the day off of work and my boyfriend wanted to run to Pequod's for a quick lunch.  They have a weekday lunch deal...a personal pan pizza with one topping and either pop or beer for $4.95.  So, we dropped in...there were 2 other tables occupied.  My boyfriend ordered the lunch deal, and I ordered a slice of mushroom.  We waited 45 minutes (way longer then necessary).  Finally, our waiter came out with my slice of pizza, which was completely over done.  It was black on the bottom.  He exclaimed that he was going to bring out my boyfriend's slice, but that it was a little overdone.  He told my boyfriend that he didn't know what the ""guys in the back were doing""  but that he already asked them to put a new pizza in the oven.  He brought the pizza out for us to look at and it was completely burnt.  He suggested we wait 12 minutes for a new one...since we had already waited 3 times that, my boyfriend told them to forget it.  We left without eating anything.  It was a complete disappointment.This is the best Chicago-style pizza I've encountered.  My boyfriend and I go once a week and order the deep-dish pizza.  We recommend extra sauce and fresh garlic.  As with many of my dining recommendations, this is not inexpensive pizza.  But, it's worth every penny.  The crust is the perfect blend of crisp and pan and it always comes out of the over piping hot.  The toppings are $2.00 each, but it's been my experience that just cheese pizza is delicious (and I like a lot of toppings).  The pizza is extremely filling...we usually get a medium and have some to take home.  And, if you're not into the pizza, or if you're looking for a little something extra, the garden salad is really nice.  It's not the crunchy iceberg that you'd usually find at a pizza place.  This is a nice romaine lettuce with a slice of tomato, onions and black olives.  Very good...I ask for the dressing on the side.  Pequod's may have made me a pizza snob, but it's well worth it.",17,1,negative

4799,"I used to live in Chicago and remember 8 years ago when Pequod's was a hole-in-the-wall with plastic tables, no ambience, very good service, and outstanding, very unique deep-dish pizza.  Things have changed a lot.  I recently returned to Chicago with 3 buddies for a cubs game and I was looking forward to Pequod's.  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.We were told the wait for a table was 25 minutes.  It took over an hour.  We bid our time at the (small) bar and despite complaining about the wait, were not offered any ""prizes"" at the bar as is usually the custom at a restaurant where the wait is much longer than promised (IE no free drinks).We ordered deep dish pizza (of course) and  some wings for  appetizers.  The wings came after the pizza and weren't very good anyway.  And I forgot how bad the mixed green salad is (why they continue to put canned black olives on it I just don't understand).I won't lie and say the pizza sucked.  It didn't.  But it was not as good as it used to be.  The crust was dry and flavorless, and they were cheapskates with the toppings (one piece of sausage on each slice?).  We were stuffed after 2 slices each, and we're not light eaters.The coup de grace was that a grossly drunk college student barfed at the table next to us.  Thank god we were just finishing up, but still.  There was no discount offered, no freebie, not even anything like a sincere apology.  And the restaurant didn't even kick out the drunk idiot!I hate to say it but I'd look elsewhere for an authentic deep dish chicago pizza experience.  I'd still look beyond the tourist traps in river north (IE gino's east, uno, due) but I'd recommend malnati's over pequod's at this point.  Sorry guys.",11,8,negative
4800,"Excellent pan-style pizza.  The crust really makes it, but all of it is top-notch.  That ring of burned cheese is tasty, though not mind-blowing by any means.  The sausage is very good, better than Malnati's.  Service was solid.",5,1,positive
4801,"I hadn't gone to Pequod's since well before the fire that happened, but I am glad to see that the place has bounced back. I went there with my roommate on Saturday and after seating ourselves at a table against the wall that used to be covered in graffiti and yellowing pictures but was now super clean, we ordered drinks and talked while sometimes watching commercials on one of the four (?) televisions within sight. The place was dead, but our waitress was diligent and swooped in with refills when I was low on Coca Cola.We started out with the fried appetizer combo. It's one of those things you order to trick yourself into thinking you're eating something kind of healthy since veggies are good for you, but oh yeah, they deep fry the zucchini, mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, and cheese. A tasty and filling start to lunch...in fact it was too filling since I could only eat one slice of the medium deep dish that we ordered to split and take home leftovers. Take home leftovers we did. We went with an garlic and onion (aka anti-make out) pizza and we barely conquered 1/3 of it. It's nice because by ordering a size larger pizza than you think you can eat, you are guaranteed leftovers. Our waitress explained that the burnt looking parts around the crust's edges are just caramelized cheese and while my roommate thinks it's the tastiest part, I have a mental block that does not allow me to eat things that looked burnt. He ate the tops of my otherwise delicious crusts. Nothing gets left behind at 1735!",10,4,negative
4802,"I think I might have blown out a few taste buds because our pan pizza was so good.  Normally I am a lou malanati's girl but i think I might be swinging by this place more often.  If you are a sausage lover you will definitely enjoy their spicy chunks, they lay the toppings down heavy.  I love our server's reasoning for the whole pequods whale theme.  According to them ""the owner is a real scumbag and just wanted to put some pants on moby dick""  Now that's Chicago for you!",4,1,positive

4806,"I like this place. I really do. I love the caramelized cheese on the deep dish, love the sauce on the pizza. I like the vibe, even though I feel like its lost a bit of the edge after the fire, because now it just seems bigger and open instead of cramped and cozy. To some this would be a good thing. Somehow on a cold rainy/snowy night it was a great place to squeeze in with friends and leave with a stuffed stomach. Somehow though, I can't love it. Apps are good, but common and nothing ground breaking. The liquor and beer selection is great, (anyplace with Liberty Ale is a good place to be), and the pizza is great. I think the crust is good, but I feel like its missing something. Maybe I hope it could be something of a buttery crust but it certainly keeps up with the toppings. Service is usually really good too. Its a solid pizza place and certainly will make you leave full.",17,3,negative

I have to admit, I realized that I really don't like the deep dish Chicago style but Pequod's is different. It is a deep pan pizza with a caramelized/burnt crust which is something to crave. So it is really much better than traditional Chicago style, but just as filling. I can only finish one slice here and then i get sleepy. But if you haven't tried this place- you should.

4815,"Not a 'Chicago Experience' by any means when it comes to pizza, but one thing is for sure: the food is DAMN good. This place was hopping when we stopped in after a quick change of plans on our way to Potbelly. The prices are reasonable, but they absolutely nickel and dime you. Two of us got a medium pizza with two ingredients, garlic bread, and each drank water and got out for a little over $30.00 including a reasonable tip. The service is so-so, not bad by any means. The food is great. The prices are fair but annoyingly nitpicky. It'd eat there again if the crave hit me.",5,2,negative

Peperoni has a nice flavor (peperoni and onion toppings are highly recommended).  The pizza is very filling- I can eat 2 pieces if I'm absolulety starving.  However, as far as re-heating the next day, this pizza tastes the best, hands down.

4823,"It tastes like i'm eating a giant buttermilk biscuit with tomato sauce on top with my choice of toppings. This may sound awesome if you like buttermilk biscuits... but I don't. The only thing I like about their deep dish pizza is the burnt outer edges of the crust. I also like how they USED to (and i say this because they don't anymore) pile on the pepperoni. I prefer their thin crust although i find that their crust is not so thin... but more doughy. Make sure you confirm that you want deep dish or thin crust if you order over the phone. They use a dumb push to talk phone to  eliminate background noise and it seems like the phone operator that was helping me didn't  know it's ""push to talk"" not... ""talk and then push."" I got home and saw that they gave me a deep dish instead of thin crust making my night majorly disappointing. Can't bash on this place cause it's the only pizza place that's near where I live that's walkable. If I lived further away...

Because I arrived at an off-peak hour (5pm) and was with only one other person, we were seated right away without reservations on the second floor. I prepared myself for a long wait, so my dining companion and I ordered some Goose Island and jalepeno poppers to pass the time. The poppers were pretty good. They were filled with cheddar cheese, and although I prefer the cream cheese jalepeno poppers, these were hot and cheesy and fried and really, what more could you ask for?Our spinach and garlic deep dish arrived about 45 minutes later. We decided to go with spinach and garlic to compare it to Giordano's, whose spinach and garlic pizza is out of this world. This pizza was also excellent. The actual cheesy-garlicky-spinach part of the pizza probably wasn't as good as giardano's because the amount of toppings was kind of weak, but this is not to say that it was bad. It was still delicious. The crust, of course, was insanely good. Chewy, crispy, doughy- all at the same time. How is this even possible? One of life's great mysteries.

4848,"Was fortunate to visit the Morton Grove location.  Definitely a hole in the wall pizzeria!  Loud music, awesome waiter, awesome food!  Had a deep dish pizza - the cheese caramelized to perfection - sweetness of the dough - it made my visit awesome!  Looking for Chicago style pizza?

4849,"if i want non-thin crust pizza, i prefer pequods over everything. their pan/deep dish is so good, i often eat too much and have to sit around for a while before i am able to move again. if i die from eating pizza (god willing), i hope there's a slice of this stuff hanging out of my mouth.it's a little expensive unless you have a larger group. their beer prices are atrocious, but i don't want to fill up on drinks so i usually just get water. i've never had to wait for a table because the have two floors of seating, but i have had to wait longer than i'd like to actually get my pizza. the wait staff is nice and, and i like that they serve everyone their first piece when they bring it out.i've shared a lot of good memories with friends and family at pequods, and when someone comes in from out of town, this is often a first choice for dinner. there's not much else to say except that if you love pizza, you'll love pequods.",9,3,positive
4850,"My new favorite deep dish in the city, and my husband has started requesting it on a weekly basis.  There's nothing remarkable about the thin crust, but the deep dish is the perfect cheese/sauce/crust combo.  The french fries were also lacking so I had to deduct a star, because fries and pizza are my favorite combination.  But, it's nice to be able to get a table at a decent time without having to wait.  Service is average but we'll come back anyways - the pizza IS that good, and yes, you should try it.",7,0,positive

4852,"I know so many people who love this place.  Can't explain it.  I think it's like eating a week old unsugary cake with a too sweet pizza sauce and too much cheese on top.  The crust is as thick as your wrist and the cheese gets all burnt around the sides of the pan.  The service blows.   Like a couple of other places I've eaten, they employ good looking entitled hipsters who seem to think they're 'above' the job they're doing but not so above it that they choose to eat from the dumpster in the back.",5,0,negative

4863,"Yikes! I haven't ordered Pequod's in a long time but my husband and I decided to take a break from our usual picks- Peace, Lou Malnatis and Roots. I can't stress how much I regret that decision.  Maybe our pizza was an isolated incident but it was horrible. We spent $40 on a large pizza and a Caesar salad, neither of which was edible. Aside from the fact that the pizza weighed about 15lbs- it was so soggy it looked like bread dipped in soup- I even tried to salvage it with a few minutes in the toaster oven- failed attempt. The salad was wilted and smothered in dressing- Who dumps dressing all over a salad when it's carry out?  I very rarely write reviews, especially bad ones-but I was so irritated at the waste of money and food I couldn't help but write this. Maybe they offer an uncut option to avoid the sogginess? With so many great reviews I can only imagine that our order just came out bad because I assure you that the quality we received would not warrant any return customers.",3,9,negative

4865,"I had wanted to try this pizza spot since the mid-90's when I first became aware of it. So I finally did on a Friday night, and boy was I disappointed. Surprisingly disappointed. Two of us ordered and shared the Pequod's salad and a medium deep dish sausage/mushroom pizza. The salad was OK. The pizza was just a big sloppy mess, in my opinion on a way-too-thick crust. Gobs of flavorless tomato sauce as if I were eating lasagna on top of baked bread. Just did not do the trick for me and I wished I had taken my visitor from out or town someplace else, like Lou M's or Bacino's. I felt as if I were in some college joint, maybe in Wisconsin, eating a bad version of Chicago deep dish pizza. On the positive side, the service was good. And the price was right.  But it's just not this boy's cup o' tea when it comes to 'za. It's a rare occasion that I eat deep dish pizza, so when I do, it won't be here.",5,5,negative

4868,"I was so excited to go here and eat burnt cheese!!!!! After two buses and a long walk I finally found myself drooling over other peoples pan pizza...ordered the pequod salad, actually used real lettuce and it was huge- easily enough for 2 people, maybe 3.  Nothing extrordinary but satisfactory.  The pizza was a killjoy.  What is up with the bisquit crust?  First off- the crust is almost and inch thick and 3/4 of it is semi-crunchy like a british bisquit.  The bf/cook said that they precook the crust so they can melt the cheese on high heat and get the burnedness...but I wasn't into it(the crust)... and another thing- It's called Salt people- use it. Screw our blood pressure. Bland sauce, bland crust.  Not terrible but not worth the two buses and long walk.  I would go back if a friend insisted on it- but I was definitely disappointed.",5,3,negative

4876,"First off, I am a huge fan of the pan pizza. Carmelized cheese is a quick route to my heart. The service can be variable, but is mostly attentive and friendly, and perpetrated by a host of cleverly t-shirted hipster kids (as opposed to the moneyed, less-tattooed and more brand-conscious older variety). I am a sucker for anywhere that can simultaneously provide me with a personal size pan pizza & a beer, as well as recall shined-up, halcyon-days memories of my own collegiate pizza-joint-working past -- for less than five bucks. And it's close to my house. A good option before or after a flick at Webster Place.",6,1,positive
4877,"I really wanted to like this pizza, especially after all the glowing reviews. And for the most part I did, but I had one problem with my pizza. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, and the pie was covered with so many pepperoni that I thought I had ordered a ""pepperoni lovers"". Why complain? Well, I tend to enjoy my pepperoni cooked into the cheese as oppose to the pepperoni thrown on top merely as another topping. And because there was so much pepperoni the pizza had a very salty taste. So why am I giving this 4 stars? Because when I took off the pepperoni this was one heck of a pizza! Next time I order from Pequod's, I'm getting the cheese or sausage pizza. (I should also mention that Pequod's has a great relaxed atmosphere with a good staff.)",7,2,positive
4878,"It was just ok as far as pizza goes. The biggest disappointment was the crust. It didn't have any flavor, very bland. And I tend not to like places that cut their pizza in squares. Cutting it this way creates 4 weird tiny triangle pieces that consist of mostly crust and, if you are lucky, one bite of cheese and toppings.  It also creates that one sloppy piece in the middle that no one wants and you can't pick up cuz it doesn't have a crust to hold on to. I've had better pizza and the atmosphere and waitstaff was only so-so.",3,4,negative

4880,"i was beginning to think that perhaps i just don't like deep dish pizza, but after a friend raved about this place, i had to give it a try, especially since it's within walking distance of home. they load their pizzas with toppings, which is a plus in my book. i had a pizza with mushrooms, black olives & large chunks of sausage and found it quite tasty. i don't usually like burnt food, and the cheese on the crust does look burnt, but it was the most flavorful part of the pizza. the tomato sauce could use more seasoning, but overall better than uno or giordano's. i can't say i fully recommend the fried shrooms. they were standard fare, and though they weren't greasy, the mushrooms inside seemed a bit too juicy and bland. the service was friendly and fast though i think the place gets more crowded on the weekend. i'll be back or order delivery when i need a pizza fix.",6,4,positive
4881,Great pizza! Been here twice. Had the thin crust the first time and the deep dish the second time. I was very happy both times! The restaurant is very narrow and there are not a ton of tables.

4890,"Something horrible happened between 1999 and now - Pequod's began to suck. I haven't been there since I was a kid, but a recent delivery experience will ensure that I will not be adding Pequod's back into my dining rotation. Several things led to Pequod's demise: First, delivery took an hour and a half. That's way too long for thin crust. Second, it was $45 for two pizzas - a medium and a large - and I didn't see any specks of gold on my pizza, so I was left wondering why it was so costly. Finally, the pizza itself kinda, sorta, really had no flavor. Our spinach tasted like basil (did they mix up the ingredients?), and the crust tasted like bread from 1982. A lackluster sauce and flavorless mozzarella were the final nails in the ""Pequod's sucks"" pizza coffin. Oh well, another day, another pizza joint.",5,5,negative

Okay, stuff happens. So we wait the 15 minutes, then another 10. Finally a pizza comes to our table, and it's the wrong pizza. We ordered thin, it's thick. Waited over an hour from the time we ordered and never got to eat, because they screwed it up not once, but twice, and I wasn't about to wait around for a 3rd screw up. We got an apology and they gave us a $15 gift certificate (which seems a bit scant for such a royal screw up), so at least they felt bad about it, but I'm not going back.",1,6,negative
4904,"The few times I've had Pequod's pizza, I've been drunk.  Very drunk.  As anyone who has been drunk before knows, alcohol makes everything taste at least 22% more delicious.  This makes Pequod's pizza 122% delicious.  VERY good stuff.  It looks a little offputting.  I mean, let's call a spade a spade.  It's burnt.  That burnt cheese is actually made of baby kittens and angels and cotton candy though, and will be some of the most beautiful stuff ever to enter your mouth.  Insert joke here.",4,5,positive
4905,"Yeah, it's a good life, you know? Swinging into Pequod's on a Friday afternoon and ordering their $5 lunch special can make anyone feel great about what's coming up and what's already occurred. What is the lunch special, you wonder, merely the incredible deal of a personal Chicago style deep dish and a beer. Seriously, at this price you can ""splurge"" on any of the fantastic appetizers (the garlic bread and mozzarella stick come highly recommended,) and still feel guilty about not having paid full price for a full stomach and a knowing satisfaction that is worth every penny.With the Webster Place theatre across the street, Pequod's also makes a perfect place for dinner dates and if a full sized Chicago deep dish is too daunting the calorically challenged will be thrilled to know that the thin crust pizza is also incredible. In any case the multitude of toppings and perfectly heated ovens almost make the crust moot, as you'll be getting a great pizza no matter what you go with.",12,2,positive

4910,"This place gets 5 stars for a variety of reasons. Number one- although the place was an absolute madhouse on Friday night, the guy working on seating people remained calm and pleasant. Number two, they only had (maybe only have) one register, but the bartender kept my beers flowing and change coming...This place was very similar to a sauna on Friday night. It was uncomfortably hot, but you new the result would be positive. We waited, probably the longest I have ever waited for a table but I really didn't care. It was shocking that beer were $6 though...annoying too.The pizza was awesome. There was not too much breading, there was not too much sauce and there was a good amount of toppings along with it. Whatever they do with the crust is genius. This definitely sets this place apart from other deep dish places. I will definitely be back, preferably on a slower night; they carry-out as well. The menu is limited, but I don't see why anyone else would go here but for pizza. Be prepared to WAIT, even with a reservation. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable night out, this is not the place. I can't imagine how hot it gets in this place in the summer...",13,4,positive
4911,"Had the most amazing deep dish pizza there. Went there a week or so ago when I was friend in town visiting from out of town. We went there like mid-afternoon and by the time we left around 3ish, the place was packed on a Saturday. Maybe everyone eating there was hungover from the night before and was eating a late lunch? Not sure. Anyway....my friend lived here for 5 yrs before moving out west. When I asked her what she wanted to do when she was here, she had go to Pequod's pizza on her to do list. Seriously. it was one of the 2 serious things she had planned. I had only been to this place maybe like 4-5 years ago on a date. The pizza was good, but the date was bad. And I only had the thin crust. This time 3 of us ordered a medium I think,. which was six pieces in total. We got sausage and green pepper. It was AMAZINGLY good.

4924,"This is my all-time favorite pizza!  It is deep, but not quite as deep as Giordano's.  It has less cheese than traditional deep dish, which is a nice change of pace.  The best part is the crunchy, crispy crust that is carmelized!  I recommend eating-in as the crust loses some crunchiness in delivery.",4,0,positive
4925,"So against my will i went to try them again (girlfriends idea), she said we should order ahead so when we walk the 5 mins it takes to cross the street it will be there, and we can enjoy lunch and not spend most of it starving.  Ok, so at 11:55am i call them and tell them i want to place an order, extra cheese caramelized crust, simple. I ask how long will it take to make it, she says approx 25-30 mins, ok so i tell her i work right across the street and i will walk over there at 12:25. everything seems to be going good, I'm in high hopes. Arrive there, everyone was friendly, seated in a corner booth, for more than 2, not the one we wanted but ill take it. So after saying multiple times that i ordered ahead, they finally understand. so here comes 11:50 roughly 20 mins after we were seated, almost an hour from when i placed the order and no food. I give my gf a snared look and told her she better be the one to ask whats going on, so to put this shortly, my gf asked the hostess why it took so long for our pizza to get there even though we ordered ahead of time. She said they don't make it until people are seated that way if they don't arrive at the time they say the pizza wont be cold, we told her that whoever we talked to on the phone was told we are across the street and will walk over at that time. She then said she would talk to the girl who answers the phone, we both thought ok, makes sense they want to bring out a nice hot, fresh pizza. We bite into the pizza..... and its luke warm!!! REALLY?!?!  And i know its not their fault, but there was a nat flying around us the whole time and it just didn't help the whole situation.  Second thought, that is their fault!!! So i tried walking in and ordering took 45 mins, 2nd time i order ahead and it took just as long. Once against great pizza ruined by bad service ;-/",11,5,negative
4926,"Great pizza - never dined in, but always get it delivered.  You want toppings?  This place is probably king for toppings because its toppings overload, but that's a good thing.  If you want sausage, I think you can order the wheel of meat (layer of meat), or have it crumpled.  I've always have either the pepperoni only (a couple of co-workers are touchy like that) or the SMOG, which is the Morton Grove location's abbreviation of Sausage, Mushroom, Onions, and Green peppers.Compares nicely with Lou Malnati's and Gino's East as far as deep dish pizza is concerned, but still hold its own as being unique, so I can't say its better or worse than, say, Lou's.Otherwise, the pizza is such that you can get full from one or two pieces, regardless of size of the pie, and the taste is grand with the pizza sauce, cheese, crust, and the purposely burnt edges which is cheese - don't like the burnt cheese, take it off.Delivery is almost always good, as they will get it to you within 60-90 minutes; such is deep dish pizza for the long times but worth it.People taking your order is pleasant to deal with, though the web site is a bit spartan.Recommended for pizza lovers!Oh yeah, this location has been renovated from a fire, so it should be nice and up for business already.",10,4,positive

4945,"I have never eaten AT Pequods only ordered out.  I would have to say hands down this is the best deep dish pizza in chicago.  The sauce is perfect and the crust is to die for.  Usually when you eat a deep dish pizza the crust at the end is this flaky cookie like substance that tastes OK but is not as good as the rest of the pizza.  Pequods carmalizes their crust and has the deep dish meat of the center of the pizza go all the way to the end.  You get a carmalized sweet treat.  How often would you say that the crust is the best part of the pizza, when the pizza is already good?",7,2,positive

4947,O.K.  This is one of those Chicago spots you must try.  It is not about the service or the atmosphere.  The pizza is the best in the city.  Hands down.  Four of us went to lunch for 33 bucks plus tip.  We each had a  personal deep dish and a drink.  It was so reasonable I thought it could have been a mistake.   We called ahead of time to place our order.  Our pizza was on the table five minutes after we sat.  If you think the pizza is burned you really do not know food and do not get the concept.  If you bothered to eat the caramelized  crust you would taste the light sweetness and great texture it brings.  Keep up the great work.,6,2,positive
4948,"I had a hankering for a pizzeria with a pan pizza with caramelized cheese all the way to the edges of the pan, fresh toppings, a great beer list and a friendly atmosphere. I had heard of Pequod's and their infamous pizza so I made the trek down to Webster Ave. to indulge. I ordered a Belgium-style beer and they informed my that I get a free pint glass with it that evening. Nice. I don't remember the beer (I think from Goose Island or New Belgium) but it was cold and refreshing. After 2 or 3 (probably 4) pints of beer the pizza arrived, (pan pizzas always take between 20-30 minutes no matter where you). The whiff of the pizza as it was laid down in front of me was magical. Caramelized cheese, browned and crispy crust, toppings arranged perfectly and the server even dished out the first slice on my plate too. I also forgot to mention that the people watching in Pequod's, although small and cozy, can be quite interesting and fun too. Cold Beer, Caramelized Pizza, Great Servers and An Inviting Atmosphere, Pequod's is a great Chicago Pizzeria.",11,3,positive

I have been seated right away during the week but the weekends can get very busy especially being right accross the street from Webster Place Movie theatre.Food: The thin crust pizza to me is one of the best in the city. Cracker thin type crust while the toppings are placed on top of the cheese to give a perfect char to them. They also have a deep dish pizza which many like as well. You will also find many appetizers and salads on the menu. They also have a good bar selection.Staff: Fairly attentive. Never really had a problem. Check this place out if you want a great pizza.

4969,"Maybe it was a bad day for them, maybe the staff is int he middle of post Christmas doldrums but we had a horrible experience here.  Where to start?  We walked in at lunch, when someone finally noticed us standing in front near the front we were directed to sit in the only blind spot allowing a view of the TV's despite ample additional seating.  Upon asking for another seat eyes rolled and uncheerfully relented.  After taking our drink and food orders it took a good ten minutes to get our drinks despite a sparsely filled restaurant.  We began to notice that we were seriously getting hungry and checking the clock.  After attempting to flag down our waitress we got the hostess who we could see visually scrambling to even find our order in the kitchen.  She eventually sauntered back and said it would only be another 15 minutes and it takes 25 to make a pizza.  I explained our wait was already 40 minutes to which she disagreed despite not even being our waitress.  I told her that we came in as sportcenter came on her main TV, that means it was 12pm it was now 12:43.  She asked if I was sure and I explained I had been watching ESPN for 15 years so yeah I am pretty sure.  10 minutes later our waitress finally came with our pizza and took our drink refills about 20 minutes past the time they were empty.  Now at last we had the long awaited pizza that I had long heard was the best in the area.  In a word it was crap, well more like uncooked crap. I am not sure not being a chef at any time but I assume all the cheese should melt and the crust should not be doughy enough use as pool stick chalk in a pinch. The Beef was nasty, the peppers were fresh a week ago at best and the sauce was cold in patches.  It was atrocious and beat out the service for ""worst in show"" of this circus act.  I can understand being off at times but at lunch?

Having read fellow Yelpers' reviews, I had extremely high expectations for Pequod's pizza.  But, sadly sadly sadly, this pizza is so very overrated. So, in addition to my heart, the hurt spread to my head because I couldn't quite fathom why this pizza is so beloved. It is a ridiculously thick slab of unappetizing crust (so much so that I sliced most of the bottom half off), followed by a nearly non-existent layer of cheese, slathered with sweet, chunky sauce (which was probably the only good thing), and finished off with a meager sprinkling of your topping of choice. Oh-- I forgot to mention that the outer edge of the crust is lined with black, burnt cheese which they call ""caramelized cheese crust,"" but this can easily be achieved by throwing mozzarella, parmesan, or your preferred cheese on a hot skillet and letting it sit there until it burns. I adore pizza. Really truly utterly adore pizza. I do not know what this round concoction was.

4994,I was there last night sitting in the upstairs and a roach crawled along the side of our table.  I will NEVER go there again.  It's ashame because I love their pizza.,1,0,negative
4995,great pizza!!! went there for lunch today and fell in love with the crust everyone talks about. maybe had a beer too many on my lunch break but hey... don't judge me!,2,2,positive

4997,Crispy baked-on-cheese crust. Definitely my favorite deep dish in Chicago.,1,0,positive
4998,"I was disappointed by Pequod's...had heard so many great things that I was expecting something really extraordinary.   I thought the pizza was too heavy, too doughy, too many toppings.  For deep dish I really prefer My Pie, which has a much lighter crust.",4,1,negative
4999,"definately worthwhile if you are looking for something different when it comes to pizza. they make their pizza crust from carmelized cheese. if you decide to dine, you'll find it roomy, clean, and nice widescreen televisions playing sports and awesome music channels. thumbs up.",5,0,positive
5000,"yummmmmm - great cheesy pizza, thick carmelized crust.  oooh, my mouth is watering.  looks like all of nothing on the outside, but the food is great.  big upstairs too.  great for a pizza before a movie on webster.",4,1,positive
5001,"I will only bring out of towners to try Pequod's deep dish. Other places are good, but Pequod's blows all the rest out of the water. If you read most of the people who reviewed and gave less than 3 stars you'll note that they all mention they didn't order the deep dish. There might've been a few that did order the deep dish - but you can't please everyone. Apparently, the trick here, is to only get the deep dish, otherwise, it's anyones guess how your meal will turn out. This place is great, in my opinion. My suggestion: Deep dish, at the location (delivery might render a slightly more mushy pizza), beer and one topping only. This is why I minus one star from the five star pizza. The toppings issue. They're $2 for each damn topping! $2 for onion?? Seriously - I should omit 2 stars for that sort of tom foolery but the crust is so good that I can't. I love this pizza. Maybe bring some mushrooms, onions and other easy to fold away in your pocket foods to top the pizza once it gets to you. :) But then that's just kinda weird. People might stare. Either way, this pizza is rock star!",6,3,positive
5002,"Yum! Pequods' pizza is delicious and definitely worth a visit.  It's not typical Chicago pizza, but if you're up for crispy pan pizza, this is the place to go. It's not as bready or cheesy as most pan pizzas around Chicago, but the burnt crust sets it apart than others. I would suggest ordering extra cheese because the cheese is kind of scarce without it. There is also a lunch special too which I like best because the pizzas are small making the bread extra crisp.",5,2,positive
5003,"Blah--do not order their thin crust pizza by the slice! I ordered a slice with pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. The man said it would only be 7 minutes...cool! When it came out it looked like they already had a pepperoni pizza cooked, and then just threw on mushrooms and olives on top and threw it back in the oven for 5 minutes. It was really gross because the mushrooms were still raw. I will have to go back to try their deep dish everyone raves about.",3,1,negative
5004,"some of the best deep dish in chicago; however, I only give 4 stars because I prefer more sauce and less breading. The toppings are awesome though. especially the sausage. and... have some of the best outer crust ive ever had",4,0,positive
5005,"the best! i've lived in chicago for 16 years, and eaten a lot of pizza. and although i'll always prefer thin-crust (i eat pizza for the toppings, not the crust), i gotta confess that pequod's is hands-down the best deep-dish i've ever had. nothing even comes close to their carmelized cheese crust (which somehow isn't overly dense) and zippy, not-too-sweet sauce. it's pretty far from my house, so no delivery - boo! - but sometimes the cravings are so strong i'll fight traffic and make the trip. it can get crowded on the weekends, so go early, or try a weeknight.",7,3,positive
5006,"after hearing that this was the favorite deep dish pizza place of many friends and acquaintances, i expected a little more. i am a big crust person, and i didn't really love the crust here. from what i understand, if you don't really like the buttery crusts of other deep dish pizza proprieters, then that's a reason to love pequod's. it was good but not the best i've ever had.",6,0,negative
5007,The best pizza in Chicago! No doubt. Their thrin crust pizza is really good since I'm not a big fan of deep dish. Though I do eye up other people's deep dish pizza's which look incredibly good so I might try it next time.,4,1,positive

5009,"I'm visiting from California, so I had to see what real deep dish pizza is all about.  Pequod's has kind of a dive bar feel, which I like.  Brick walls and music blaring, ranging from old school punk to Johnny Cash.  The pizza was amazing.  It's all about the caramelized cheese.  It gives it an added tasty kick.  They were also very generous with the toppings.  I definitely had no regrets, just a happy belly.",4,1,positive
5010,The best deep dish pizza in the world!,1,0,positive
5011,"Anyone who thinks that Lou Malnati's or Gino's is the best pizza in Chicago is a moron. Pequods is the best. Don't bother with the thin crust. It really isn't anything special, but you can't beat the deep dish. I like to eat there and order delivery. It is always consistent. However, I was with friends who wanted mushrooms, which I don't love but I dealt with it. The mushrooms made the pizza a little soggy. I wouldn't recommend getting them, but every other time I have had this pizza (which is often) it is the best. The caramelized crust is fantastic.",8,1,positive
5012,"As a new Chicago resident I relied on Yelp for my craving for pizza.  (I am pregnant)  I ordered a pan pizza for pick up.  They said it would take 30 min.  It was ready when I got there. I live less than a half-mile away and waited about 15 minutes before I left my residence.  The pizza was great. I love the sauce, cheese, crust and the pepperoni!! I added jalepenos (to encourage labor :)) and it was delicious! My husband loved it too.    * Next time I think we will stay and eat it there, the atmosphere was good and they weren't very busy (its was mothers day).  I cant wait to try the beers on tap!",7,0,positive
5013,"i've lived in chicago for like 6 years now and have wanted to go here forever without any real excuse for having not done so... i finally went.  let's just say i wasn't wowed. maybe i was expecting too much? from my other food reviews, you can likely piece together that i'm the kind of guy who survives mainly on pizza, burgers, and sandwiches, which is totally true. so i've tried a lot. what i got: garlic bread, a pan cheese pizza, pitcher of beer. the garlic bread was pretty weak and bland, i could've gone to Jewel and gotten a loaf of Cole's that'd smoke this. the pizza was fine, not great, not bad. near perfect amount of cheese, tasty crust, carmelized edge as others have noted. the best part - no tomato chunks in the sauce. i hate tomato chunks and often have to pick at a pizza, esp.' deep dish' before i can really eat it. don't ask why, they just make me want to barf if i bite into one. the beer was exactly as ordered, it came in a pitcher. i'll have to go back and try again, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen...",7,6,negative
5014,BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO PERIOD.....  The size of the toppings are very generous.  We usually get green peppers and it comes with large slices of peppers.  The best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese around the edges of the pizza.  I wish there was a way to just get the crust and a sauce to dip in.  Excellent.  Only one issue in all the times I ordered and it was there was not enough sauce on the pie.  If you like a lot of sauce I would suggest asking for extra sauce.,4,0,positive
5015,"Paquiano's is a good good day.  That buttery crust really hits the spot.  However, I've had mixed results as far as delivery times and it's still not as good as Lou's.  It's a unique pizza that I will get once in a while.",3,0,positive
5016,"i can't believe there seem to be endless amazing pizzerias in chicago.  i get it already!  the pizza at pequod's is super delicious.  the burnt carmelized crust is the best part.  it made me feel real full real fast, though.  after an order of cheesy garlic bread, i could only handle one piece!  i also love the atmosphere.  it has a great feeling to it; like a perfect place for ""family night"" but without being lame.  i can't wait to go again.",9,1,positive
5017,"great pizza, fun venue. catch a movie at the amc across the street and come late (it's usually pretty busy and ALWAYS loud, so coming late cuts down on the people noise). yum.",3,0,positive
5018,"I'm giving this 4 stars because it's my second favortie pizza in the city.  My favorite is Art of Pizza, which has a deep (dish) place in my heart.  The carmelized cheese is what makes this so tasty and unique.  I love the sausage and jalapeno and they have some tasty beers on tap.  If it's your mission to try as many Chicago Pizza joints, this needs to be on your list!  The only thing that stinks is the street parking, can be a little difficult in that neighborhood.",2,2,positive
5019,"it's deep dish, but not so much that you feel disgustingly heavy afterwards.  super tasty toppings.  i left my crust and was told by someone i was with that i should eat it.  i didn't realize there was caramelized cheese on there!  i'm so glad i didn't miss that feature of it, b/c it was really yummy!  i was visiting from out of town, and this was a really good ""chicago style pizza"" choice for me to go to.",3,1,positive
5020,"My family and I have been fans of Pequod's for decades, and I've never written a review on Yelp before. But I just had an experience worth sharing. White taking refuge from a thunderstorm, I decided to have lunch at Pequod's. I ordered the special which is a drink and personal pizza. When I was about half way through, a guy who had not been my server asked if I would like another drink. And I said sure I'll have another Diet Coke. He neglected to mention that you don't get free refills on the lunch special. So my 6 dollar lunch went up to $8.57. I realize this isn't a huge amount of money, but I strongly feel he had an obligation to tell me I would be charged for another drink. When I asked the hostess after I received the check, she blew me off. A smarter business move would have been to have taken the charge off and apologized. But I guess they don't care about customer relations.  The whole act just struck me as shady, and I will probably go to Malnati's more often than Pequod's...no matter how good their pizza is.",6,2,negative
5021,"Before I discovered Pequods, I was a stalwart supporter of the Lou Malnati deep dish, but the caramelized cheese crust is the best I've ever had. Its nary burnt and is complimented by a saltier, sweeter, sauce than Lou's.  Its cheaper too, and the kitchen's open til 2am most days allowing you to gorge late at night. The lunch special, a personal pan pizza, is size of almost two slices and comes with a pint of beer or pop for 5 bucks. The staff is always super nice, even late as hell when you think you're being a bother. Calling ahead is always a great idea when ordering deep dish otherwise you'll  have a 45 min wait.  This place is hands down my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago.",7,2,positive

5024,"By far, the best chicagoland pizza place because of their nontraditional crust. For all the suburban folks, another pequod's pizza hidden in the streets of Morton Grove. Good eats and great atmosphere.",2,0,positive
5025,"I've always heard so many good things about Pequod's for years but never tried it until a few months ago. Sadly, we were very disappointed. It wasn't bad pizza because there really isn't such a thing as bad pizza. However, there is such a thing as average pizza and Pequaod's in my opinion was that....just average. Nothing on this pizza stood out to me as being anything special. I was hoping to love it. From all the good reviews I've read, I expected to love it. After finally trying the pizza, all I could say was ""this is it""? Again not that if was bad or anything like that. The problem was it was very average and forgettable. I think there are far better choices out there and I believe some of the hype and popularity of Pequod's is just that. It almost has the feel or gives the impression that it's cool to go to Pequod's so that's why people do it. Would I go again if only based on the pizza? No.",7,5,negative
5026,"Not a huge fan of Deep Dish in general, but of the Chicago Deep Dish joints this is probably my favorite.  I went there with a group of people on Sunday night and we were able to get a table pretty quickly.  Also, if you're not a big Deep Dish eater, they have thin crust (it's actually more like regular crust) pizza and it's really, really good.",4,0,positive

5028,"Pequods is by far the best Chicago pizza.  It doesnt get the recognition it deserves.  The part of the crust that looks burnt is the best part.  Only thing they can work on is the service.  Our waitress wasnt friendly or attentive, and it wasnt busy.  But overall this place is worth the mediocre service.",6,0,positive
5029,"Great Chicago 'Za.  The key here is to ask for the pizza ""well done"" meaning the cheese is baked until carmelized around the edges.  This is deep dish, but not stuffed pizza.  Pep/Mushroom combo is solid.  Currently the location in the city is under reconstruction, but they will deliver from the burbs if you call the regular number.  Worth the wait on delivery and a must visit once they re-open at the intersection of clyb/webster.",2,0,positive
5030,"This pizza is absolutely the best deep dish in Chicago.  The carmelized crust is the bomb. Sometimes it is sausage, onion and mushroom, other times it is canadian bacon and pineapple.  Everytime, it is mouth watering delicious.  Delivery can take a long time, so if you are able to pick it up yourself, you can get your slice of heaven much quicker, but if not, it is well worth the wait.",6,1,positive
5031,"My girlfriend I ventured to this Lincoln Park establishment last night based on reviews from fellow yelpers.  Upon arriving, I immediately knew I would enjoy sitting in this place and having a cold beer because of the lively atmosphere.  However, I didn't know if I would enjoy eating their pie.  I am always skeptical of pizza places that claim to be better than Gino's East or Lou's.We started off with the Combo appetizer which includes cheese sticks, fried mushroom caps, fried zucchini, and poppers.  All of this for 9 bucks definitely worth the money.  Then had the house salad which included carrots, olives, tomatoes, and chopped romaine.  Also, a pretty good deal at 4 bucks a salad.  Now for the main course, we ordered the large pizza in hopes we would enjoy it enough to last through the weekend.  My half of the pizza was sausage, onions, and green pepper (this is what I normally order at Lou's or Gino's).  The pizza arrived at our table with the patented black crust and the eating began.  I believe the true test of Chicago deep dish pizza is actually the final bite of pizza where you get the crust and the toppings all in one.  I immediately turned my pizza around and took this bite.  It was great the crust was crunchy and airy at the same time.  The toppings were plentiful and the sausage had good seasoning.  When I saw the black crust I wondered how can that not taste burnt, but it didn't.  It tasted like, well... caramelized cheese,brilliant!  For 4 beers, appetizer, salad, pizza, and tip this experience cost us $74.00 and we still have three quarters of a pizza left to enjoy.  Although I would not rank these guys above Lou's or Gino's I wont rank them below either.",16,4,positive

5033,"Maxim named this best pizza in Chicago.  I'm going to have to agree that i was very impressed.  You can smell its awesome aroma from outside.  I've only had the non-stuffed, thin crust pizza.  It isn't your typical thin crust, it's more like a ""handtossed"" or pan crust.  I recommend double the cheese and sausage!!! Outstanding!!!  Great service, even when you are arguing about what toppings to get on the pizza :-)  It's moderately priced.",5,1,positive
5034,"OOH that carmelized cheese.  The elusive 5 star pizza award is once again handed out to Pequods.  2 locations to serve you, one in morton grove for the nw people and one in the city on webster.  quality and continuity is the same at each location so feel free to go wherever is closest.  IF you do not like deep dish pizza, keep moving, this is their specialty.  lets look at the pizza, shall we?  First thing you notice is that like true deep dish pizza (ala uno/due) it is served at your table in the pan it was cooked in, this is very important as the hot pan continues to crisp the pizza as you wait for your next slice (pinoccio's in niles could take this lesson) so your za never gets soggy. Second, it looks like it should, lots of oh so good carmelized cheese on the edge of each slice.  Thirdly, toppings are GENEROUS and excellent.  Truly a sausage lovers dream, but the other toppings are just as good, just not as stand out.  I am pretty big pizza eater, but 2 slices of pequods and I'm done.  I'd reccommend sizing your pizza with a 2-3 slice expectancy.  Also, pequods pizza has a great ability to be reheated and lose very little of it's original flavor.  I attribute this to the low moisture content of the dough after it cooks, but who knows for sure.  morton grove is a small place, but you can call ahead before you get there to get the pizza going.  Chicago is a larger operation, but parking can suck.  I know chicago will deliver, not sure about morton grove.  Waitstaff in MG is very freindly.  If you have out of town guests who are dying for unos/due's but you hate going downtown, feel confident with this fine representation of Chicago's Classic Deep Dish.",16,3,positive
